assuming Ontario, Canada a gym welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show high\nRight in there the Windsor, Ontario\nOh Kevin Kevin okay Hi Kevin welcome to the show high\nRight area they're like oh you said told me to think of them are all ... and you were talking about their double sucking Democrats saying not to do something they're doing it immediately afterwards and I said you think they know what they're doing\nYou didn't think they were aware that they were doing that and I disagree I think they know what they're doing always and they just know that people listen to whatever the last um\nNo but no I honestly don't think of times and I get this by the way from not my opinion I actually was when I read Bernard Goldberg will bias and he said they were in the media they really don't know\nThey really don't think that they're biased they really don't and and he was in the ... they work their right he'd worked for Denver he just thinks that they're right on everything but they never even miss the obvious things like the obvious irony that as they're calling for the end the divisiveness they're putting out the most divisive statement\nThat they themselves are not conscious that they're doing it\nThat they don't even believe that they just think they're they are so\nJust driven by tunnel vision that they don't even know that they're doing it and I so that that that really didn't come from you that came from Bernard Goldberg who worked for Dan Rather and wrote the book biased and talked about the media at large and the mindset\nThat they actually have they don't walk around thinking that were Democrats and Republicans are thinking there's Democrats or Republicans and as a way that we think and we're always right and they never questioned the way that they think they actually don't analyze what they're saying that the time that they're doing it\nAnd I just believe and again we don't know because you know ... whether it's soccer or whatever I Can't read his mind ... but it's such an obvious\nIt's such an obvious divisive statement that once you explain that people go oh yeah they claim they're against divisiveness but they're actually obviously for divisiveness well especially if\nYou're in a news organization where's the fear of\nBeing wrong where is that\nIt's not there anymore no you saw the New York times when the New York times to the

get acclimated to the new home\nOnce you've decided that dog is yours and you know we will sign all the paperwork over where you are the legal owner once you sign those papers you're responsible for feeding the dog and caring for the dog and all the medical and everything I'm from there on and\nIt would took you to starting for instance for lord that rescue the need\nUm I grew up in the house with a pit bull back then I'm Nineteen\nSeventy three nobody really talked about the bulls nobody understood there was no stigma attached to them um I've always loved animals I Love all animals always wanted to be a veterinarian and it was when I was a child but you know life gets in the way and it happens and\nI'm a I moved down to ah Georgia\nAnd a promise to my step kids would get a dog and one of my uh friends down here his daughter came home with a little pit bull puppy that she found and uh she was going to they're going to get to the pound less and bring it to the house that took this little dog in and\nWe ah\n[noise] we love them so much he was so special that we wanted to get another one and I went to the pound to see well what was available for adoption and all it was was pit bulls and all of them were scheduled to be euthanized than it bothered me and I said you know I Need to do something about it and [laughter]\nWhoops groups who says my you started off you you you actually work in corporate America yeah I I work on\nWall Street for close to Twenty years um I worked as a commodities broker and trader and then a a managing director for an equity a research publication\nLook at you know our way to get a job where you worked on Wall street\n[laughter] look can be deceiving [laughter] yeah I didn't have the tattoos on my face I didn't have tattoos on my hands but I was fully tattooed Idaho sleeves and and some other tattoos\nBut um that went behind the business sure nobody sort\nIt out how much rewarding is doing this that Wall Street it doesn't compare\nUm we work hard we work\nLong it's sometimes from the the human aspect of it it's thankless but from the animals\nThere's no better feeling and taking a dog that nobody else wants that has been you know\nBeaten down so bad and just in worse shape than watch it come back and to thrive and to be able to be so loving and caring and all these dogs just they they just resilient and uh they're amazing creatures they overcome stuff that we would never overcome\nAnd the sad thing is I mean what we're here talking about today a lot of animals don't make it so we had a do get better you can't help all you can help\nAll of them um we turned down you know I'm more than we've taken a\nI get somewhere between ... eleven hundred and Fifteen hundred emails a day we get about three hundred phone calls a day between all our phone lines of messages on Facebook we can't even as from all\nThe the amount of pit bulls that die in shelters every year oh it's not getting better over a million pit bulls every year a euthanized across the United states for no other reason than space in any municipal a pound when you walk in there any city any major city\nI'm In Atlanta\nGold and go to any of the county pounds it's Seventy five to eighty five percent pit bulls pit bull mixes and they're the ratio of pit bulls that need rescuing the to the rest of the ratio of people who actually Russian rescue them\nForeign feud between there's very few pit bull rescues around\nIt so we're here talking about yeah at the vigil they all have yes a Saturday in November third\nYep the strand theater in Marietta square beautiful a story theater what we're doing is um it's national pit bull awareness month of October we weren't able to get the strand theater and we wanted to be inside this year because of the weather concerns uh was showing a film called the champions it's\nAbout the Michael Vick dogs are one of the stars of the film will be speaking I'll be speaking I'm I'll be ... through a [laughter] my my speech um\nYou've already said you're not the best public speaking I'm probably\nThe worst public speaker in the world and uh I'm I'm ... but that's not my job I'm not I'm good with animals [laughter] and I I'm not a politician so I don't have a speech writer I speak from my heart I speak from you know my experience and uh hopefully that's worth something to somebody\nBut these um this event is basically\nIt's a it's kind of two fold it's an awareness of then and we want to bring the attention to the pit bull catastrophe it's like um\nIt's bad when a million dollars a euthanized every year for no other reason than space it's epidemic it's it's bad it's catastrophic and or the vigil is for all the pit bulls that die in pounds every every day that we can't save\nAnd then after the vigil a we have a party and we uh celebrate the ones that we do the ones that we were able to say the comebacks and uh\nWe need to grow so we can do more and this event is also\nTo help the community you know we do a lot of work within the community and we want to help people we can't take all the pit bulls and if you're going to rescue dogs in this day and age in this in in the Atlanta area you're going to call them across pit bulls so we want to guide you from our experience\nI'd have to wait any better than anybody else but we do have experience um [noise] we want to die on the rescue groups maybe offer them become a resource for them we might not be able to take every animal in but maybe we can help you where you can take the animal in and we can provide some support or some knowledge for you\nFor as many that you do save does it sometimes like necessarily keep you up a bother you that you can save a ball\nIt kills me every day uh like we had talked earlier you know we can coast we ... we do a lot of good work and we can stay right here and be very comfortable\nIn not struggle and but we have to grow\nAnd we have to grow to meet the needed the breed and we have to grow to meet the needs of the community this is a community problem\nPeople don't realize how how it affects their community these these towns these these county pounds are filled with nothing but pit bulls it's wasting resources it's it's you know physically it's very expensive for these these uh\nYou know the these pounds to how's the dogs and um to provide care for them in the meantime and to euthanize dogs is not cheap\nWell and the stigma that comes along with the breed or why you know a longer ed malicious that's the stigma that comes along with which actually got to think\nAbout it in the media how are these dogs portrayed anytime you sure about something a pit bull it's never in a positive light\nYou'd never see any positivity when it when it comes to when it comes to a pit bull in the media it's always you know it sells what's on ... what do people watch on the news disaster you know crime that is what they they don't see feel good stories that doesn't sell\nPit bulls are great dogs they're great for the ride owners and that's what we try to do is put them into the right hands in a race some of the stigma is\nA lot of people are afraid of pit bulls but a lot of people are afraid of what they don't know and they don't know anything about the breed and you need to really educate yourself about the breed and that's part of the vigil too that's part of my ... my speech is\nNot sitting your dog up to fail and being responsible pit bull owner um we have to be vigilant this people are gunning for these breed for this breed it's\nEven dog lovers disliked pit bulls it's like the breed they love to hate and every time something happens that involved in in you know there's an incident involving a pit bull will one step closer to somebody trying to ban this breed which is not\nGonna change anything\nAnd um what what is what is the vigil\nNovember third that it starts at three thirty the movie starts at three thirty it's free but anybody who wants to come all ages the movie individual part of free\nOr if you want to purchase an electronic candle to light with us as a small charge for it if you'd like to attend the after party tickets are available online and saving pit bulls dot org\nI'm tickets thrown at twenty five dollars this ... tickets I think they're sixty or\nParty is great but I'd like everybody there at the vigil and at the movie and that's the important part of the party is the party is just for fun\nIs that how many dogs or do you currently have in the in the shelter right now uh [noise] at my property now\nI think thirty I think I have thirty at my place\nAnd how long how many have been adopted this year\nA frog bubbly\nIf I had a guess probably up around eighty or Ninety ... out this year and you know we we average about a hundred dogs and the rescue at any given time\nPeople don't people see the glamour like you know like you said they see them when he's on stage when it's you know they do their normal person they have the same brain basically the you and I have a and\nYou know they go through the same thing sometimes they feel overwhelmed sometimes I feel lonely like no one's there knowing loves them I mean this this stuff happens even to the people we idolize\nYou know the common factor in addition to having a brain is that they're humans and so we're all people and with with the same experiences we are much more alike than we believe that we are different\nAnd having the commonality of being human says the same the thing about mental health and go see your point of that you are making is that because people go by what they see and so they can't see someone who is depressed who has the ability to put on the right face\nFor other people so just because I'm smelling doesn't mean I feel I'm reflecting what I really feel on the inside and that's what\nThat that was what what people have a hard time grass me and they're shocked and they're like I Can't believe that he looks so happy he had all this money et cetera that has nothing to do with what that person is experiencing internally\nAnd so because you can see it\nAnd then we tend to think well they must not be and obviously that's not the case\nOf one of my favorites are hit on about this is Instagram why people look at others in the ground but all of us are driving a nice car they you know just went on a shopping spree on rodeo\nDrive in LA mhm and uh it's like\nThose are fraying moments I got I got pictures of ... you have the greatest life ever you're always at concerts ... Singh ... those are the moments you see that I've\nHad pigs fried or put on the Internet right I'm not going to be doing my taxes like everyone else right I mean it's just it's just what people see on the Internet they take so much into themselves my why don't I have that why don't I have their lives\nAnd it's it's taken the concept of I used to say like when people would date or first meet someone that you bring for at your ... your representative\nSo is the person that you want others to see you as they may not be who you really are so as you get to know more about people you get past the representative that they bring forward Instagram is just in\n... exaggerated form of the same thing I get to pick and choose the moments that I Want to share with you I Do it I Want us there and I will pick and choose my best moments my best angles [laughter]\nAll those things because that is the image I Want to be put out I don't necessarily want to share on a day that I'm not at my desk I'm not feeling well I've had days where I Do it regularly my job is complex I take a mental health day when I Need it\nI don't allow myself to get to a point where I'm so overwhelmed and I'm so stressed that now I'm physically impact impacted I Will take those days and I encourage people to do that\nThat's another thing I remember the first time I saw so until your mental health\nThey were gone for ... you don't need a mental health you're barred yeah and um I don't I think I don't want to read 'em to a point where people start to abuse mental health day right artist won a day off so I'm gonna take a mental health day\nI don't want it to ever be abused and I personally have never taken one ... I'm not because I don't I don't believe it or it's just I just I just had my way of coping when I when I get off work sometimes but\nAh the stigma that comes along with that especially a man of masculine man saying yeah you almost like a mental health day as a man Lance society and I think that is just ... ...\nI agree and you know what's happening is people are taking them that is calling them something else I don't feel well today I'm sick today I'm just not feeling myself today and so which you can have physical I'm\nI'm a a physical impact because of your mental health state so depression can lead to physical and I'm just using depression or the wide obviously assortment of mental health disorders we could talk about but the president with his prevail is I think is relevant for this\nUm has physical you can have physical pain associated with your depression you could have digestive issues associated with your depression\nSo the person may not even realize this is really because I Am stressed or ... at a level of depression or anxiety whatever it may be but they can see the physical impact so I think people do it they just don't say it's a mental health day they just say it's a sick day\nAnd world thing going back to suicide prevention is every time someone commits suicide\nI I Know that some people will like you know you you see there was a good person and then they commit suicide or there that's bad or a bad person does this thing with us wrong with it and people instead of saying what caused him\nDo that or they gave up on life when you have others are easy way out who um [noise] ah that that bothers me\nIt it bothers me as well and I've had the opportunity to speak to people many people who have attempted suicide and we're not successful and are these are not people that are weak people um these are not people that are um are scared or trying to take an easy way out\nThey are dealing with some very significant issues in for them in that moment they see no other way and so when you talk to survivors and you talk to people who've been in that space I think you start to feel differently about that\nAnd I don't care who you are I don't care how successful you are how um whenever there's your life your every single person at some point in their life has had a moment no really thought they were going to know I'm going to kill myself but I'm Wondering though they were in such a bad mental health state\nAnd wondering what does that would be like right right I was having everybody I'm Sorry I agree I I don't disagree at\nThe same way that so many people would ever be afraid to say it would be afraid to say it was it a shame because I mean everyone doesn't matter how rich you are everyone has a bad day sometimes absolutely ruin as a day where they're just like this is not working you know I just can't take this anymore\nIt does not discriminate it as a matter what race you are it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter you're socio economic status it doesn't matter what country you're from it doesn't matter what culture you're in North south it does not matter it doesn't discriminate it's an equal opportunities\nUm type of thing so\nIf people don't take anything else from the conversation that we're having today is that um this can happen to anyone this is a every one issue everyone should be concerned everyone should have awareness and everyone should become more informed and more educated about\nMental health and how it impacts everyone moving\nAnd I do Monica is trying to get away from the stigma that some we you know so I was very important is you know the the negativity like you said earlier in the interview no one's going to laugh at a cancer patient or no one's going to live with someone that has a brain tumor don't laugh at someone that has mental health problems\nExactly um I agree a hundred percent is no laughing matter and we've seen what happens when\nUnderlining mental health issues don't get addressed um people may say oh well this person committed suicide and they don't have a history of mental health that doesn't mean just because that person never was diagnosed as having a mental\nIllness that they did not have mental health issues I'm obviously there's a level of at a minimum depression that exists for someone who feels so I'm distraught that they have come to the decision that the only way out for\nA situation that is in many many many circumstances if not all temporary or situation that is temporary to make such a permanent decision so regardless of they have a history of a document it mental health issue their mental health obviously it's compromise\nAnd so this is a person problem people problem and it does not discriminate and I just can't get that point across enough\nAnd for more information or working people go\nSure thank you we have in our state um one of the one stays in the country to have a twenty four seven crisis and access line that anyone in the state can call 'em that is the Georgia crisis and access line and the number one eight hundred seven one five for two to five\nMonica Johnson director of division of

back to the car which if you're both [noise]\nYou know the to go into the warehouse to drive in the trucks to picking up toys to you know it's it's all done on a volunteer basis so yeah so it's like um four thousand dollars\nA share your job of the the head of all this and and the fact that you know you're organizing and so what are what are other people like that are in this room right now what are they doing right now\nOh my goodness um they they probably are at the warehouse there's they're setting the box up there still sorting the toys out from last year to get ready um they're coordinating events I mean that that's one of the huge thinks that that helps drive you know helps to express that we have\nAnywhere between three and six hundred events every year\nAnd and it's all done by individuals as not coordinated by the way we are not that it's done by people you know ... having kids birthday parties and they instead of getting toys they want to do one of them to toys for pots or it's golf tournaments\nFrisbee golf you know the ultimate Frisbee\nAnd it wasn't so there's there's an event next I think it's either this weekend in Mexican innocence Stockbridge and it's the rise of money in and toys for toys for not um you ... so it's it's it's different things on different levels I mean we have people who will donate food\nTo the volunteers are working in a warehouse we have people who will donate you know or volunteer to go pick up toys they'll they'll\n[noise] um I'm trying to think anything you can think of it it's it's all donated all volunteered um drive trucks\nDrive forklifts sort toys bag delays drop off boxes ... anything you name it it's all driven by volunteers\nSo ... so you're not just taking toys on a day to day basis you also have really cool events so would have been some really good successful events that are for ...\nYou know one of one of my favorite events is is actually hosted by the Atlanta Falcons\nAnd um I don't really know that it has a title or if it has a name but this'll be the third year that they've done it and what they do is they bring in children from under privileged families\nAnd they have a whole event with him at actually at ... stadium which is really kind of cool um and so what they do is say they get a wish list of of the children and it's usually I don't know I'm going to say like forty five fifty kids um we supply the toys I'm the wives of the falcons rap the toys\nAnd they put the name of each child on a locker in the in the locker room and the kids get to go in and they get to find their locker and they get to to get their their toys and one one year it was just so heartbreaking because I'm One little boy you must spend five or six and he opened up he goes\nTo I get to keep these aren't they all mind he says I've never had a Christmas\nYou know and and you'd that just breaks your heart and and you asked why we do it that's why we do it\nAnd that once again it's a huge reason the toys retards needs money they need sponsors there it's not like you're cheaper than any of the money you get all the money's going back to giving kids a Christmas that they otherwise wouldn't have and I shared with humidity time ... a share that I was extremely privileged growing up or you know never wanted for anything\nA wealthy family and but every time we were given something we were made sure of our parents they always reminded us you remember that when we give you this you better be grateful because you know there should it would would never get kind of stuff and I took him out\nInto my adult life now and that's why I Love doing this and getting to talk to all these nonprofits and all these people that are doing such amazing things because you're out there given up your time uh and do do it with a lot of stress on the same time to make sure kids have a good Christmas\nIt's you know it's absolutely worth well I mean you know and I know in my heart of hearts that they could replace me tomorrow but I don't know if it's real you know well thank you but but I you know I Do what I can and and I hope everyone else says what they can you know one of the biggest things that I Am courage people to do is like you know that Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving\nWhen everybody's out shopping you just grab another Barbier grab another football or whatever it is you know and start that process now and\nThat again that again a most kids today want either pass they want the newest iPhone they want\nThese crazy gadgets these kids are happy like you said get a football ... be a new T shirt you know ... and that just blows my mind a happy you can make a kid that you know has never had a Christmas before going back to the falcons story kid looking into a Walker and say I get to keep all of these\nAnd and then it makes me just feel awful from my privileged upbringing to where I got what I wanted a more that's why I Love doing this and you know given people lie to us we're taught a platform to you know say what they need what you know all because they're\nDoing you know and that's and that's a big mission of the the marine reserves I mean is to give a child a toy that that is there that they can show ownership that they can take pride in that they you know to help them you feel confident about themselves and you know not envious of somebody who gets everything I mean because it's like I've got something up my own\nAnd tortured thoughts has some amazing current sponsors right\nNow yes I'm In public since obviously a big sponsor of ours every year but some that don't always get mentioned quite as much as cutie they are huge sponsor for us I'm looking forward to working with them again this year hopefully we can talk more toy drops to their location there is also group here in Atlanta called um\nM. A. I. D. A. which is the metro Atlanta auto Dealers Association\nThey're huge supporter as to his friends and I think they have like a hundred and twenty nine dealers\nAnd each dealer is a drop site\nAnd they not only are they a job that but they also pick up the toys in deliverance who warehouse for us so they do it for us which is huge you know because we don't you know obviously we're we're working with volunteers so anything that we can help you know the or the companies can help us that teach\nAnd that's an amazing thing about a city like Atlanta we have so many people that are willing to help you know you're looking for a permanent space that you know you don't have to pay for because like I said going back to the beginning for every ten dollars that torture ties has to spend\nThat is one child that might not have Christmas ... and we're we're always like you said the goal was always a million every year to reach and it's sad that I always say this is well twenty Eighteen we shouldn't have a society where kids all over the next Christmas is coming from where kids they'll know where their next meal is coming from\nOr they don't even know what Christmas is because they've never experienced it\nNever woken up on Christmas morning and ran into a tree and seen presidents under a tree or had a a Christmas meal is a family\nMhm and that's it yeah and again you land is a great city you too and I know everyone has a big heart and it's just getting the word out and getting people to understand this is what we may\nWell once again push thoughts needs money they need sponsors

an early age to be the perfect woman a moment\nYou know I've got to say that\nYou gave my father information to try that route but yeah but it had to cut off after a while\nIt was about ...\nMillion on me right here in LA and don't even know as you were saying\nYeah I think he's on by reconnecting so much is because I've got school aged girls and I just thought what you were doing with your daughter and I'm thinking okay as much as I like young working with young people I don't know if I Would have had the idea to be able to build something that would be fruitful like what you've done yeah so\nI Will say this um everybody has a a niche in life right now you're gifted different than mine and my my gift happens to be\nUm kids you know and mentoring a kid and actually people of all ages um I don't know it's just like a magnet for you so like I was saying uh my mom was saying you know kids kids at the middle school age um because of the peer pressure on the motion of changes that are going through\nPhysical changes some want to be grown so I Want to be\nSaid within one hour yeah those are very\nChallenging um age group but it's also a fun age\nGet is and is it really all they want is love and attention and somebody you know to really hear somebody told me they said that what they really want us to be hurt mhm may want to know that you hear them you know and I think sometimes\nWhen we when I grew up it was like you spoke kids are supposed to be seen not hurt yeah yeah and yeah it's just so an healthy you know when that's not really good point too badly\nTransitioning now to like you say when we were growing up um and what kids are told them talk now even in school they're encouraged to share their\nPeak right and then they come home and we're like you don't have any of us do you know\n... it's a yes or a you know it's a a balance but you have to have you done with kids of today is generate exactly\nAnd I want to have a serious question of do you have a challenge with you know you're teaching a young daughter young a lady out to be a lady when she goes home to an environment that has no kind of strange about that yeah you know do you deal with that and how do you handle that because\nYou can only have a four hour or so were you know but then they have to go home to the structured house that they don't talk the same way that all structure yeah or lack of structure you know do you see yourself working with the show you these kids and then they kind of relapse and when I go home\nRun so what's that question I have to say that the majority of the girls that I've worked with um really have a environment it's kind of balance you know at home and away from home or you work with a bit you\n\nKnow let's talk about that for real because there have been have like we can on out here to be good in ... and all of that right however\nUm you know some some girls still have challenges ran home really might not be um a town it's like what you're saying Mardi going right you know from one environment where you're taught something structural and being going back to an environment where he's like you know like there is no such threat I Can't say my father dealt with that you know in their career you know\n... for me I have not dealt with with that particular environment so what I Would say is I focus on helping any girl I'm focused on her self esteem that that really comfortable with their body image and are being very comfortable with identifying their own talent and desires are\nSpeaking on the ... and not allowing people to change their dreams because I think it's actually an African American community\nUm parents sometimes have bear bear desire what they were kids to do and again it goes back to not being hurt they don't listen to the kids and help their kids identify their talent so we talk a lot about that you know and I'm I'm I Will say no I I'm not saying I never worked with a young lady\nNow it just hasn't been brought us work like but nobody like I was a kid like when I was getting\nReady to go after people\nGetting contact we don't want their daughter getting to your program\nAll right so um I

would\n\n[laughter]\n\nAt the beginning [laughter] by where I met her I don't I don't have any way as I had mentioned\nMy mother's a middle school teacher but there's a lot of things that I just jot down and I think about in a process and right but I'm an\nOlder than ... ... email myself and I send myself text messages or whatever so back in August of a twenty two thousand six wow I decided to start ... even the corporate it um I had had my own child\nAnd I said you know what I Want to go ahead and just focus on his business and um\nSo what I did it I started out with a cohort of girls maybe like teen girls actually knew their moms yeah so that's where the trust came together and um I just started doing it like what I call signature events and I would have them for two nights and we would\nPractice etiquette by going to a restaurant we will have a speaker and funny that were just talking about health issues one of my speakers actually with a doctor from CDC to talk to them about the right um important some calcium to the body Mm um I have a events where they would go out and see like people I was a man is um\nYou have a lot of art element any legal you know so we would do anything and we'd also do a slumber party so that's where the trust came in um in again self dealing with parents that I really knew from that point then by word of mouth I started working with different girls\nBut even when I'm when we'd be it the sleep over as we would have um a statement called girl talk and I would let them write questions on a piece of paper and put them in a bowl right all them out and we talk about them openly\nI had an agreement with the parents that we wouldn't be talking about sex or anything like that because really that's not my expertise where how ever became\nIf it came I wouldn't let the right now it's time for you to have that talk right order right and so you know from that's where we started\nIt's funny you mentioned that because it you know generally speaking if you get a bunch of girls together it's going to come on\nBut I found that for my girls that I'm not saying that I'm super mom and who knows I mean they're still at a young age but I started talking to them about sex before they even had a concept of it I mean I wasn't being graphic but I wanted them to be okay with their bodies and okay would understand that that there's going to make a point where\nYou find men attractive and you're going to have these feelings you know what I mean and and the other things that comes along with ... you notice that some of the girls were more prepared than others um ah my parents should do\nTo be honest we really don't discuss six okay you know there might have been a question or two over all the years and it's like well OK Eighteen now you know we really focused on my image okay harm etiquette being I'm\nCool being a girl having fun and being a girl we do our show will be having sex and middle school\nAnyway whether or not but the point you want to\nBe their air pollution yeah you know\nIn an infant see your point I'm like I said if it came up I Would just like the parent and okay for my own daughter personally I think like you you know it's good to have those conversations inside the home right and so that's why you want\nTo bring it up to ... if if it comes up and um so that's pretty much how we started so we would do um those events maybe like um three times a year\nOr more can you tell us about a pink affairs because that was the last event that I got another one element or a knife mine\nBut yeah how do you go yeah one\nThing and it is as when I came in the room I ask you that I have put the one thing I Do believe in getting sleep for eight\nHours document wanting to do [laughter]\n\nOh my\nGod right just woke\nUp you know I don't know about ... or ... by the sleep anymore we say okay nice yes okay so anyway a lot of really believe um\nYeah a lot of sleep and I'm lots of vitamin OK and I'm just the high energy count a girl you know get that from my dad I'm inherently are genetically or whatever you want to call it um so I don't know if it's something that's really a passion right you're going to have the energy to\nDo it by would you give to people that do want to have a small business and but they're not ready to leave their fulltime career\nRight did you do so one thing is it definitely takes a lot of time preparation you do need to know when a step back and not living in a future full time job I'm very close to retiring from CDC so my goal\nRight now it's like she's Thirty years later than a\nA ... so that when I retire I Can't do more of the meetings with the girls\nLike I'm going to do yeah I'm In addition to some other things that I had in mind but I'm juggling a career in entrepreneurship is definitely a challenge is not for everyone if not for the week um is for people that are really structure in goal oriented you\nKnow you get out of ... believe me 'cause I'm not a truck driver so I've had to be calm structured to be able to any time management\nIs important and even on top of that if you're a woman and a mother you\nKnow you have a key it that that nice she was well I'm In the end if you are married or dating or you know significant other that you know that's going to and\nYou have that down and it was all about hiring ended a mate that way and the biggest\nThing is time management knowing 'em how to set goals and achieve a having a vision board yes I just started another vision board in it I haven't been bored stickers on a wall just\nSome ... going to be on the last thing you\nCan look at your dreams and see how far you calm and ... you know if you've accomplished things and so my career is totally different from the off the deep with I'm a I T person I'm my background is I'd seen statistics so I'm a very structured person yes in my career and then I get to be very creative without\nThe all the way they're going to come back and talk to that 'cause we want to find out more about that we've got to get into our hot topics but one more time how do we get in contact\nWith you okay so I was a email is the best way to contact me and again it's D O ill ill is the number two D. I. V. H. S. the ... the dog to the was the most ... ... email dot\nCom okay you're a hot topic today ...\nI had been hearing so much\nStuff in the news about how the people that didn't vote is are the ones that candidate through this whole election and and that we're trying to register new voters and stuff like that and so my hot topic today is our non voting people of ... and\nHow should we addressed that how ... what can we do to get us up off our but to vote so that we can see the changes that are ...\nYou see I think that they should put print out some kind of data you know like the day after election and any black person I didn't vote they should just get beaten oh okay\nI Know that it's all a punishment by snakes and we just going to be a little too you know you gotta have some kind of motivation to actually see it hits their house right people hitting their house right but they\nDid it it it hitting their bank account is more there's opportunities and sending them when their communities are taken care of the way other communities are taking care of becoming involved in these local elections\nAnd it and and and and those are going to say I'm Crazy but you know whenever you watch the Olympics and you're watching a race yeah for some reason\nI Know this isn't why but we do this if there's a black man running in that race or more by looking at it and I'm rooting for him window right if it's a whole bunch of people that I don't relate to I have no interest in it right when we have these elections here\nAnd then when you see someone that looks like you you're more adamant about during the vote you know right when when he came everybody wanted to vote right mhm if he's on the ticket was like a\nDeath survive them getting now in that vibe is like okay there are young people that are motivated to vote still people our age that are like do my boat don't count my vote you don't count and it does it does what would you say to that\nI um I honestly feel like it's a really complex subject one thing I was a hot topic there but really um\nI think it again is that going back to home again um we have like some separate them in\nWhat people feel about voting you know you have some homes and they brought their children up to you know no voting is so important right and they can give their children concrete example right hand they can give their friends kind of like we ... the voting is so important yeah but you know in a circle that we running are we giving people\nConcrete reasons why they can whining about why given them the numbers in Staten Island you know look what happened like a lot of people you got to be able to say you can say it but then you got to give them a concrete example\nRight and then you know sometimes I think we as parents and older generations needs to get that excitement do like Ukraine excited about getting their license you need to be learning about when he won you know but they don't get excited as much about ... right you know because they don't know much about it you know they don't let it feels like\nYoung people now are more excited about voting like there's more mark they want to make the beginning they wouldn't make it but we still got to vote you still got thirty five forty and fifty year old people that are not showing up in these polls right I Want to pay me the election I\nThink after I'm and I'm just gonna keep it real I'm like a you know after the last election that really hurt a lot of people you know I'm Still I'm tiny oh you sound\nLike you know like our political system really the most honest political system have even change their mind like that you know somebody that went out and voted in is like I'm not voting anymore right\nYeah and I think that yeah that that that might be some of your older generation and I I like that is some of our older generation but we need you to vote on the daily you how low right Denver but\nI'm telling you what you need about ...

I'm Sorry preferably heavy [laughter]\nOh I've got my ... year old you are rare form alright\nAlright so um how much it will cost and kept me get a divorce\nHe wants to call eating the same food everyday cruel treatment\nI mean I don't want to eat brain ever so if that's all I'm eating [laughter] but I'm not as on okay yeah well in Georgia there is actually Thirteen different grounds to get a divorce under one of them is cruel treatment\nUm I'm not sure that would classify as cruel treatment but it's up to the trial or a fact but yeah at the end of the day in Georgia you really there's one grounds that most of the use most commonly and that's because we are no fault state but as of as our most states are all states and in\nThe United states there are no fault so it just requires at the marriages era truly broke and there's no requirement of um [noise]\nPleading the cruel treatment I mean he could um and there's some judges that will consider behavior when it comes to equitably dividing the up the state of the divorce I'm Sorry the state of the parties and\nBut uh it's not\nIt's not necessarily to go down that route a lot of course you just don't care I'm I hate to say that but\nWell and on top of that I'll build on that a little bit by adding a ground other than that the marriages ... broke which is you basically just saying there's no hope of reconciliation\nYou've done everything that you can to try and salvage marriage it's not going to work you need a divorce and as long as one party feel that way they're going to get a divorce yeah if you add another ground\nLike there to jokes aside or you know used as an example adultery adultery can be a ground for divorce now some people will say I want to put that in my position for divorce right by putting it in the position you have to prove that\nIn order to get a divorce on the ground of adultery right sometimes what will say to people is\n... you know how important is it to prove that point you can still bring the issue of adultery up in the context of a divorce mhm you may not get the divorce on the ground of adultery but all of that bad behavior still going to potentially come in if necessary\nAnd as far as the way we practice we tend to not like to put all that those things in their initial pleading 'cause that's public record and that's what and we think it in most situations it opens the door to work towards settlement if it's not in there now there's there's exceptions for that role but um for the most part ... start off\nWith a very vanilla pleading depleting is the first thing that was one of the things you file a complaint for divorce has a pleading you file it keep it very vanilla um that's where it starts to divorce process and the complaint\nKeep it been able to keep the door open to settling the case that way it doesn't cost the zombie an arm and a leg\n[laughter] so I if I had a zombie arm right now I Would be you over the head with it for anyone listening I wouldn't really do that I'm not a violent person so I saw okay you want on TV [laughter] that's right and cost\nI mean look at our our job as attorneys is to get our clients through a divorce as quickly and efficiently as we can mhm\nThe the\nEasier that the process is if the parties can reach an agreement if they can't agree on terms then there was no reason why it should be prolonged that we can therefore limit the costs\nExactly so if you if you keep the pleading to if I knew a pleading it could cost a lot less rather than started off with saying quote treatment and for adultery\nAnd then the other side even if they did it there immediately defensive but Aaron ... going to basically thinking they have to go to war to try and either disapprove it or you know prevent you from proving that bad behavior\nYeah ... and up next it's my turn the giver hypothetical to Todd\nIn bars for mind's going to involve the creature from back black looking for the back of the [noise]\nMy books days every\nAnimal friends everybody everybody's kids ate animal cracks even you probably did hang man if I still think\nOf all I I Love them now I remember getting a little box with the little white spring and opened it up because I had that kind of watch the paper on the inside you open it up and I love this\nWell Peter stay fresher Nabisco Sharif\nDo the boxes remember the boxers would have four little animals on the front yet or is it looked like they were like little cage had little line\nYou know it looked like an old circus train face\nOr they're just out of the cages now\nOn the ...

I tried to figure out what Doug ... I mean I don't watch the show religious\nAnd while I mean right now going to get on with the advice\nOr sorry [laughter] so what was just needs to be this oh come on [laughter]\nAll right so mommy mommy\nIs seeking a change in child support and what she's getting just isn't enough and when ... was set originally was based on the mist belief that her new movie was going to be a huge box office success but it didn't go nearly as she expected so she's making less than what was put on the worksheets and\nIn addition the father Tom is do even better because he's released several movies to her one mommy movie ... okay this again is a child support modification case\nWhat was it was a child sports set in a divorce case or it was under in this hypo it was in the original divorce because that can influence things why because there is a two year rule when it comes to support modifications that\nYeah barring some ah involuntary job loss you have to wait two years between each modification of speaking just about Georgia right now uh but you can modified any point after a divorce so there's ... there's not a two year limitation\nAll right so is the child around me too because um I mean how much does a mommy mommy needs to spend on a on a mommy child because um they're dead right I mean\nThey don't know how much embalming caught [laughter] means the rap and and especially if you get like nordstroms her you know you get like\nReally nice rat [laughter] um I don't know if you're you're a little out of touch a very ...\nI'm not as familiar I I don't know my mommy ... enough\nAnd the the what what do they scare a Beatles I mean they have a couple of pepper Beatles\nAnd uh and I don't know what they eat other than the people who are foolish enough Ramin [laughter] so anyway [noise]\nAll right so a will there's a lot we can talk about here um [noise] well you know what do you know what changes have been has there been any changes besides the movie is ...\nSo let's say a jokes aside let's say that the big changes or that her income has gone down to his income has gone up All right well then unless you can say without putting a number on it let's say that it was a significant risk reduction for her and significant increase for him\nSo I guess we we would one thing we would do is we would plug those numbers and now a challenge you have here in Georgia is the child support worksheets the\nBCS so the basic child support obligation caps out of the total thirty thousand dollars a month or more you're talking about movie stars where you can quickly exceed thirty thousand dollars a month so\nOften there's a high income mediation and that that's one of the things that's going to have to be examined this is not a typical apart from being an undead jobs for modification case there is a it's not your typical case because you're dealing with high income part off\nI didn't say that these are being sea level movies\nI mean they're not to [laughter] these are the good mommy movie ... yeah [laughter] for the good [laughter] but you're right you're right and with very\nHigh income the calculator camped out at thirty thousand dollars a month combined gross income doesn't mean that the court keep consider additional income right it's just that at that point it becomes a deviation you're asking the court to go beyond what the calculator and what the the worksheet allows for\nRight sort of getting ... getting very hyper focused on Georgia law right now because when it comes to deviations there's mandatory deviations and then there's discretionary deviation some as soon as you fall outside that the BCS oh now you're in discretionary territory and and so the courts at that point are going to have to look at\nWhat they're gonna have to look at you know water the childcare or the cost relating to the mummy child so bad I mean that's I was trying to understand the\n[noise] I didn't think about the wraps costing a lot of money you just don't think like sorry literally you have to wrap everyday you've never hung out with a month so [laughter] I best friend has a shot with ... [laughter] so\nLittle one you gotta look is one of the costs and uh you know are there any extra ordinary costs associated with the care of this mommy yeah child and um I guess maintaining the pyramid could be expensive\nYeah well I mean that's one misunderstand me people have child support is\nTo some degree not just the food that a child needs and the clothes that a child wears\nIt's also a little bit the core that each parent uses to drive the child around in a home that each parent lives in that the child also lives in um but very in the amount of time that we have and we've done shows on child support and but in the limited time that we have\nYet to think of it almost in terms of do I have enough to just get my foot in the door to modify has been a material change of circumstance\nIn this situation I'm saying there has been a foot in the door now the calculation you're off and running and and at that point it's collecting information from mom information from dad you put it onto the worksheet like you said it's can spit out a new number and and there are times and this is why it's important to sometimes if you don't know how to work than\nThe calculation your self\nTalk to an attorney there we are like we're doing tomorrow we're doing a an internal seminar to go over the new online worksheet not because we haven't learned about it\nBut because we're always trying to better understand it right or if you're not somebody who worked in this area\nThan talk to somebody because you may not put something that should be there you may put something that shouldn't be there and that can have a significant impact on south\nSo if you're a member of the undead or Halloween monster I talked to a lawyer before he finally thing with court\nAbsolutely [laughter] ... would say to track [laughter]\nEvery one of the [laughter] and Dracula endorses Mary whether it's our [laughter] wow when we get that out there [laughter] yeah\nAll right well you know what we just we want to wish everyone a safe and fun and happy Halloween [laughter] ah we always love doing this show and you know if you want to learn more about us like I said check us out online Atlanta divorce teen dot com [noise]\nIf you have any ideas for Halloween showed next year you can always email us at radio and M.

this last night do you know when he was responding to Jeffrey to open\nMSNBC during the day that's what he was responding to Jeff Zucker the president of say CNN\nSaying that it's his fault that is what John I'm from last night Donald Trump was responding at a rally in Wisconsin too after bombs were sent out all day and he says hey man we got to come together as a country Nancy Pelosi and Chuck

it might do well loved this do he doesn't let you get away with this bogus be yes he doesn't want to get away with it that's why he just said what he said Jesus\nWhat he's saying is that at at at a at the end of the day ladies and gentlemen the media can't be several when bombs are sent doubt what do we have no hope as a country\nGo to the phones go to Matt Matt\nShelley how you doing my brother

conversation but as far as the expanded Medicaid stuff you know I I wanted to call yesterday but I couldn't I wanted to ask them what do you do with all the illegals who are going to the hospitals that you know that had to close\nWe don't pay their bills that's why the hospitals closed that has nothing to do with Medicaid to do with the fact is if people go into the ER when they have a cold\nRight after you get this big bill and then they don't pay it worked out of the ERs for probably ten years wow God Bless you\nAnd you know that I saw so many people that were in there just for a cold right it was a total waste of time and a lot of these people were in the gym and you couldn't pay their bills and the hospitals have to take\nThe law absolutely no you're right you're right Craig John the other flip side to that is if you have a governor when I did bring up yesterday and I failed to if you have a governor that wants to sanctuary state at the same time you're pushing for expanded health care I mean it's better Medicaid that's just a financial bomb waiting to go off isn't it\nExactly my point Yes sir I call it\n... and if they if they are really sick and they get hospitalized after she got a couple of days because they're actually sick and then they don't pay the bill which happens all the time\nAnd expanded Medicaid is not going to do that to help out right

[noise] [noise]\nIt's Burt massacre mid term elections I man came from the gunman behind a deadly shooting rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue heads to court tomorrow and the city's mayor takes issue with the president\nPresident Trump said things might have been different if there was an armed guard outside the tree of life synagogue were eleven people were killed Pittsburgh Mayor Bill de Vito disagrees saying that's not the way to protect against irrational behavior\nThe approach that we need to be looking at is how we take the guns which is the common denominator of every mass shooting in America out of the hands of those that are looking to express hatred through murder\nThe truth starting point is just to start to plan and people don't you hear this all the time to you don't plan to fail people just fail to plan and and it's more so when you're talking about retirement because it's one of those things that people really don't want to have to deal with most people plan their last vacation better than they plan for their retirement because it's way more fun and\nTypically people kind of put the stuff off as long as possible it's all about educating yourself and and that's why we do a lot of events ... around\nThe Atlanta area where um you can go to our website a bell advisors dot com and check into the or upcoming events so we have and it's all about educating people on on retirement and\nAnd understanding how to put all the different pieces together and your retirement but the first thing is to decide when would you really like to retire and ... what would you like to look like and tried to get a picture of what you want that to look like it's a lot of times people don't have an idea of\nWomen could retire and we want to help you figure this stuff out and that's why we we have the process that we we walk everybody that we meet with through to to get an idea of what that's going to look like\nPatrick who once you start to get that big picture it's starting to form a little bit you're starting to get an idea of what they want to do in retirement how does that help you with the planting part while\nWe take a look at when you want to retire and then when you're retiring we got a you know are there is another word for retirement is called ...\nAnd that you know you don't have a paycheck coming in now for the next twenty five thirty plus years how do we make that work so we got to take a look at where the sources of income that we can count on to replace your paycheck so we look at Social Security and if you're going to have a pension as a rental income and then we take a look at what you've saved and and how you got it invested and then how are you going to create that income that you need them\nSo that lets us be able to take a look at what the current path is that you're on now and what does that going to look like going into the future\nAnd so I'm for an example we have you know say for an example thirty thousand coming in from Social Security and\nMaybe we got ten thousand coming in from a pension so we got forty thousand in income and then we we know that your expenses or eighty thousand a year and we adjust for inflation each year we know that we're going to be named the pool forty thousand dollars a year from your life savings and how long is that going to be sustainable for\nYou know how long is going to last and so we want to know the current path a drawn and are are you on a good path to have a great retirement or are you on a course to run out of money\nAnd we want to figure out what that is most people have no idea what their lifestyle is or how much money is really coming out of their bank accounts and that's the first thing we want to know is what do you want your lifestyle to look like how much you know how much money really going to be spending in retirement and so we have a process so we walk everybody through we call this the bell retirement\nFormula where we want to understand what do you want that to look like what do you want your tyrants looking like what do you want\nTo be spending her days doing are you going to be traveling doing different hobbies doing stuff that you've been putting off\nYour whole life and so this is a part of our process and so for the next ten callers we will do the spell or time a formula for your free of charge we just have to schedule a time to get together and if you give us a call here it's seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one will be able to sit down and take a look at when he'd like to retire when is it possible for you to retire and what's that going to look like and then\nWe'll be able to understand the things that are good about what you're currently doing and you're going to want to continue to keep doing those things and we're going to go through the things that maybe are not so great that you really want to be paying attention to and then maybe there might be some strategies that we might be able to help us\nYou just got to be one of the next ten colors and calls here seven seven zero\nFive for five eighty eight eighty one and we will help you get clarity on what that is going to look like for you\nTalking today with Patrick meal there he's the founder of that law advisors I'm generally jak alongside in the studio Patrick just gave me the phone number one more time if you know seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one so Patrick figuring out the big picture helps provide ... for\nWhat you're hoping to to accomplish in retirement that can only get so far though I mean at some point you need to start figuring out how to work toward meeting does retirement goals end your needs as well as the way we can get at what are some of the tools that are out there\nA lot of times people are taking too much\nRisk Jim when it comes to investments in the market because when you're putting money into your\nFour one K. and you have money in these different types of investments you don't have a whole lot of options to keep your money safe and it's very important that if you're over fifty nine and a half or if you've already left your company you want to make sure that you are rolling the\nFour oh one K. over into your own individual Iraq count because we're getting rid of if nothing else those\nFour one K. fees those extra fees that you're having to pay\nAnd so we can roll that over into your own individual IRA and you're not going to be paying those fees anymore but we wanted to make sure we understand how much riskier currently taking and let me give me an example Jen where a lot of times folks thinks that they are invested very conservatively where if we went through another market downturn like a two thousand and eight or two thousand through two thousand and two\nMarket condition where the market is down fifty percent they think that maybe they might lose five or ten percent but we're only doing analysis on and we take the current\nWay that you're invested I had a couple that was just an here uh yesterday and their downside was fifty\nThree percent if we went through another oh wow that was a ... and so that definitely was way off from what they thought that it was going to be and so they wanted to change that immediately and and\nFigure out ways to to reduce the risk down because when you're in your twenties thirties or forties I mean you can recover from a you know a big market crashed like that and it's a lot easier to her to go through a situation like that ... when do you still have a paycheck coming out and\nShare yeah when you but when you don't have that paycheck coming in anymore and we go through a big downturn like that we got to make the decision to the market goes down to ... percent that you just don't pull any more money out or you are going to run the risk of running out of money\nI think it's interesting is that you say these different tools come after you look at the big picture I'm gambling now many people they want to come in and sit down and say well here's what I have what can I Do and yeah it's it's kind of the other way around right yeah\nYeah I had this gentleman coming earlier and he was looking he was he's gone to about two or three different advisors and he's trying to find the right one for him and when he's ... he's on he's retiring this year and he wants to find the right person\nAnd he's like Patrick I keep going into these different advisers and they just go to the lie board and they start writing some stuff down and how I should invest money\nBut they don't know anything about me they don't know anything about what it is that I'm trying to accomplish but you can throw a stone these days and you're going to hit somebody that's going to try to tell you how to invest your money and so that's what I find that people are really focused on is if people have accumulated a bunch of stuff so for an example we\nTalked about this a few times on the show where we got three to to try to take a three different\nColumns where we got one column which has your life goals in your purpose and then in the middle column we've got different recipes since strategies and then the third call them you've got tools or we could call them ingredients and so a lot of times folks have accumulated a lot of stuff so we want to get really clear on that stuff first and\nWe want to get a real picture of what's important to you what you've been dreaming about your whole life now retiring how do you want to be spending your days that's the important stuff with the real purposes maybe if you've got some clients where they're big on missionary work and they want to be traveling and\nGoing to different countries and and doing missionary work and so we want to figure out what that is because you have strategies in the middle ... that you know are going to be better than others for\nWhat what is you're trying to accomplish and then once you're very clear on what you want then the best tool start coming out as to you know how you should be invested in we we talk about this and we talk about baking where if your life goal is that you want apple pie\nAnd you've got the best apples over in your ingredients section where we're going to be more than just those apples to be able to bake the apple pie organism sentiment and some flour and some sugar and a bunch of different ingredients and then if we find out when we find out what your real life goal is to say you don't want apple pie at all what you really want to teach by\nThen it doesn't matter how great the apples are over near ingredients section they're never going to be able to make you that peach pie and so\nPeople are going at this and the extreme opposite directions so if you want to get clear on what is you really want and and get clear on your retirement and be putting a plan together this is what we hope folks with every single day thinking\nThrough all these different things and so we'd like to invite you to come in and schedule a time to go through our Bello retirement formula and we're going to sit down and do an analysis and stress test\nFor you to see where you're currently at the current path that you're on right now when can you retire when's that going to be possible and then we're going to show you the things that are good that you're currently doing if you're going to want to keep continuing\nTo do these things are we're going to show you the stuff that's not so good will be called dangers and they come into forms that come in the form of risks and they come in the form of missed opportunities and we will show you the things that we\nWould fix if we were you and you're going to get a lot of clarity going through this process with us you've got to be one of the next ten callers give us a call here at seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one we do ask you saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars toward your retirement and we'll walk you through this process again give us a call here seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one and schedule your time to come in for a visit\nWe're talking today with Patrick Mueller he's the founder has della advisors creating beautiful retirements Patrick Neal air returns happiness [noise]\n\nOn the next winter show here's my thought on Halloween costumes and black face if you're a white guy a white woman you want to play a black character feel free dress up the off and do whatever you want it's hollow people dress up as ... ... says they're really ...\nYeah no one says the black guy with the ... research is feeling any one's culture\nAnd how are they going to survive and and the quicker you get you know tuned into that the better you don't want to be like the ostrich where you just kind of putting your head in the ground and and you don't pay attention to everything for an example I the lady that that came in here and she got you know she was a I Want to say she was in her late sixties and she um she went through a divorce\nShe wasn't planning on it but her husband wasn't a good saver she wasn't a good saver and she was kind of taken a victim mentality that nobody ever told her what to do\nKind of thing well you know you just like what we're talking about today you got to seek out somebody that does not what they're doing if you're not good with this stuff and that's what we're here to help folks with is to make sure that you're always going to be okay you just got to take the action on it and nothing\nGood in life ever happens until we take action on knowledge is only potential power\nThis not until we put them into action you've got to have a good financial ally and this is what we call folks with every single day is get a clear picture of what you want your retirement and we start walking through a process and the first thing is we understand where you're at so give us a call through one of the next ten callers and schedule a time to come in\nFor a visit and we will help you sit down and talk through what you're one\nFor your retirement how you want things to look like and then we'll get a clarity of what your

strategies to help put those blend together aligned with what is this really one you just got to pick up the phone and take that action give us a call here at seven seven zero five for five\nEighty eight eighty one again that's seven seven zero five for five eighty eight eighty one and we will walk you through our process and you have to have saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars toward your retirement and give us a call here would be one of the next ten callers and we'll have to get clarity on your current situation seven seven zero\nFive four or five eighty eight eighty one is scheduled time to come in and see me\nTalking today with Patrick Mueller he's the founder of della advisors well here's the more insights from Patrick after the break when creating beautiful retirements continue in a moment [noise]\nSee\nHello Haley landing also\nThe house that we all the\nWay to get together with him for a\nWhile yeah all of a hangout boroughs day when he gets\nLeah maybe have a beer shoot some\nMaintain\nThat wouldn't be awkward Ocala, Florida there's a Florida agricultural science teacher drowned\nPossum in front of his and he won't face criminal charges because investigators say the killing our inhumane blast so she ends up playing in the finals for the U.S over champagne ship a Chinese woman has never want to\nGet an Asian woman she never once he's half Haitian have Jeff well there you are\nWelcome back thanks for sticking around today this is creating the retirements with Patrick Mueller and your house generally hacking I'm pleased to be here alongside Patrick\nHe coauthored gear to succeed with Jack Canfield he has more than Twenty years helping families with retirements he is the founder as della advisers we're talking today about planning for retirement when you have no idea what you're doing so few of us know what we're doing that Patrick\nI think it's interesting that retirement planning is is what you do all day every day tell me tell me why the interest in this particular area of finance\nIt was just missing you know we have so many different people that are out there that are just trying to tell you how to invest\nYour money Gen ... put your money here put your money there and\nAnd I just heard this morning with a gentleman was talking about earlier sitting down that you know he was looking for different advisors and he walks in and and they're really quick to tell them how to invest the money but they don't know anything about him so so that's what I Would see is that I Would see that people have their money invested and they have no idea why they have it invested that way\nAnd there was just a huge um you know you've got for an example you've got you know folks that are on the security side of things that they have a license to buy and sell security so all your money is going to be there and then you've got you know folks that are on the insurance side of things are safety side of things are banks and they want you to put all your money there\nAnd it's a good analogy is with what we do and what I Do what I Do is the difference between going to see the butcher and going to see the dietitian\nOkay so if we walk into the butcher and we say hey we're going to be grilling out this weekend what do you think we should be eating you say you know what we just got these amazing stripped stakes them from Montana\nWe just got these lamb chops and that or to die for but one hundred percent of the time we're going to be walking out with some kind of meat you know they'd be more than happy to sell as meat for breakfast lunch dinner and it doesn't make the butcher bad I mean that's just what they sell that's the business with Iran versus if we go to see the dieticians and we say hey we're going to be growing out this weekend what\nDo you think we should be eating well what do you been doing for the last forty fifty year to your body you know what where's your height and weight where's your cholesterol where's your blood pressure why\nDon't we do some blood work and find the things which are really deficient in and find out what is that you actually need to start putting the plan together for what it is that you actually need versus just trying to sell a product that they have to sell\nI like an allergy and I think that such as an important question what are you ... and where are you lacking where do you need some help\nThat really does seem to be the difference when you look at how these two different to and I'll call themselves people would would offer things that I'd tell me how that translates into what you do how you find where people are deficient wedding to help\nYou exactly I mean can you imagine just going into a doctor's office and saying hey hey doctor you know what you know what a good medication\nShe got today given him crazy yeah\nYeah so if people kind of look at it you know investments that where if you went in and the doctor I'm just said hey you know I got I got a couple of great medications for you you know they don't know anything about you\nYou know here you just start taking these medications or you'd you'd freak out a little bit but it's the same thing in this industry as we got to understand you know what what are you trying to accomplish where you at the stage of your life when are you looking to retire or maybe you're already retired and we got to take a look at what's going on so that's why we do a stress test in an analysis on your current situation so we can\nFind out where you are currently at what is the current path that you're on\nAnd then we can go through the things the vital signs and say okay well these things are good right here and then we can go through this stuff and take a look for example maybe it's the cholesterol we got to take a look and it's a little high\nIf we want to start paying some attention to this and putting together a plan you know for what you're correct that in the same thing with your finances as we want to find out what's going on and give you a clarity on what's happening and what you're clear on things then you know everybody typically knows what's important to them\nThey just don't understand how to put all these different pieces together and that's really help them you know helping people with as we're that allied are really helped put that overall plan together to make sure that you're always going to be okay and so if you'd like to go through this process with us we'd like to give you the opportunity to come in and see if you're one of the next ten callers just give us a call here at seven seven zero five\nFor five eighty eight eighty one\nAgain that seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one and schedule a time to come up for a visit\nAnd we're going to help you get clarity on your current situation and I hear feedback all the time\nThat people feel is is the most valuable time that they've ever spent uh when it comes to the things that we are talking about\nAnd so you just got to take the action and give us a call here and schedule your time to come up for a visit and we do as you say the least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars toward your retirement and we will do this for a free of charge no obligation to give us a call here seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one and I look forward to meeting you\nTalking today with Patrick Mueller he is the founder of that law advisors I'm generally jak alongside in the studio Patrick let's talk about market volatility how does this affect my retirement what can I Do to help protect what I've already saved from the next market downturn or a correction whatever ends up happening\nYes you have the ... the markets are we're in uncharted territory right now in August of this year we have hit the longest Bull Run and stock market history right yeah so it's a ... and here's the thing is when it comes to the markets to say you have hurricanes\nThat happened in the markets and you have tornadoes that happened in the markets\nSo when you've got tornadoes in the market is the problem with tornadoes is that there are extremely unpredictable\nMay happen fast ... you don't see 'em come in and they're extremely devastating and then you've got hurricanes\nAnd you know they they track these hurricanes you can kind of see him coming where we are tracking the hurricanes coming all the way over from Africa across the Atlantic and they're around long enough for us to name them that's [laughter]\nThat's exactly right and so they'll they'll tell you here's where the storm's going ahead and then you've got somebody out there you know reporting on it you know where they're in a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds and you know so they can prove that there is a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds I guess to see you know what's going on and\nIt's the same thing when it comes to the markets we can track that stuff and so we're on the the ninth year of this bull market run and\nWent to the next downturn going to happen\nI mean everybody was known your crystal ball goes micro still bone as good as any of these so called ... on the radio or TV they don't know they're going to give you the best educated guess but they don't know and uh so don't be listening to the wrong\nFolks and so it it comes down to having a solid plan if you guys all about planning planning\nYeah so this stuff is not fun stuff to talk about the two of the big pieces of the bell retirement formula we got to tune into his health care\nWhere of your whole starts declining and this is not stuff\nWe like to think about but if you can then how are we going to take care if it's if it's going to be carrying your own home or an assisted living facility or nursing home care and there are things that happen so within you know my family that uh my daughter's grandfather was diagnosed with dementia or something\nYou plan for and they're the people get to a certain state where you have to have\nA full time staff taking care of them and\nUh there's so many different things that I can talk about but then you know you got a legacy planning as well where you know if something happens to you how's everything titled or you know what's what is going to happen to all these different accounts and everything you've asked your whole life and how do you transfer all that stuff to your kids and grandkids are charities or whatever\nAnd a Tyson to taxes this law tax implications without stuff all the stuff kind of works together um\nBut we've got to talk through these different things it OK if these things happen how are we going to handle it what are the different strategies\nYou know again you don't want to be like the ostrich because the Oscars just six has had in the ground when it gets scared about where's it but just went out there\nThe wide out there and um you know you're not protecting yourself from anything you just kind of avoiding or just having to talk about it so that\nThe real work is put in by having an actual plan of talking to these different things when these things come up or if they do come up we got a plan already in place for it and I hope this never happens to anybody listening but if it does we are going to have and make sure that we have a plan for it and so if you would like to go through the same planning process of we've helped hundreds of\nFolks go through and have a successful retirement you just have to be one of the next ten callers and give us a call here seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one and we're going to start off by doing a stress test and analysis to give us clarity on where you're currently at what pets are you currently heading on your retirement was the stuff\nThat's good what is the stuff that's not so good that we were six if we were you were there were a good fit to work with each other I don't know um but will help you with some different strategies and then help legion the right direction if nothing else you've got to be one of the next and colors gives us a call here seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one and schedule your time to come in for a visit\nPatrick Mueller is the founder of Bella advisors time generally jak alongside in the studio Patrick could you just tell us a little bit more about some of these other areas of retirement planning estate planning tax\nPlanning health care planning are those things that you handle all and houses is more of a team based approach where there are others you work with how does that work with the way your business is structured\nSure we handle as much as we can and house here and most things were able to to take care of\nBut sometimes we need to bring them that tax professional so if you have the CPA or an account we like to talk with them and make sure that everybody's on the same page and we're we're not estate planning attorneys here and so if you've got an estate planning\nAttorney than we like to be talking with them as well to make sure that everybody is on the same page and it's so important because you know usually these folks are not talking to each other your financial advisors not talking to the accountant as not talking to the estate planner and so we like to make sure that we're in contact with\nEverybody so everyone's on the same page and uh so ... so there's no big mishaps that can happen\nAnd you hear about these things all the time for an example recently got Aretha Franklin ...\nYou know they have a ... didn't have a we'll prints didn't have a will there's all these different famous folks that you would think they would have you know good financial folks helping them and attorneys helping them but it's just that's just not the case of the case yeah\nSo important to get those things done so you aren't you aren't one of those stories where people talk about oh my goodness it took so long to sort all of this hour we'll Patrick for those who have been listening and ... this planning is what they're lacking as they're getting closer to retirement can you just tell us about the process\nTell us exactly what to expect what happens when we call that number today from start to many\nSo when when you give us a call ... you'll schedule a time to come in for a visit and the first visit is really just to get to know each other and what's going on in your world and what are your goals and objectives in what are you wanting things to look like in your retirement and so we talked to all those different things and\nTypically I don't know if this uh usually at that first visit what I could do to help or what kind of value we might be able to add so we're scheduling of time to get back together and it gives us time to be able to do an analysis on everything and do the stress tests that we are talking about and then we will be able to understand where you're currently at and we will talk through the\nFive areas of retirement planning so that we call the bell retirement\nFormula and we will go through the things that we think that are good that you're currently doing and you want to continue to do these things and we're going to go through the stuff is maybe not so great that you want to start paying some attention to a big one you know that we haven't talked about yet today is taxes than having a good tax plan you know she's got a ... you know most people's biggest asset besides their\nTheir home is there are raising four one K. money so you got all this tax to for money sitting there and a lot of times you think all that money is yours but it's not if you got a million dollar\nFour one K. a counter IRA account maybe six or seven hundred thousand of those years and the other forces the governments and so are you going to get that out in the most tax efficient manner so you want to understand the stuff so if you like to go through this process with us then if you're one of the next ten calls you've got to take action and give us a call here at seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one and we'll walk you through our process there's no cause no obligation because\nThere's some strategies you want to help with that's great that's not that's OK to gain some clarity on your current situation and just we just ask the two saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars towards your retirement and if you have give us a call here would be one of the next ten callers to call us at seven seven zero five for\nFive eighty eight eighty one\nAgain that seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one can't wait to meet you and to look forward to seeing you\nPatrick meal or is the founder of della advisors I'm generally jak alongside just a tiny bit of time left in today's show Patrick he had a quick final thought to share with us on what to do and you have no idea what to

hardwood floors and re finishing that you are seeking out the best\nFolks to help you with that that have been through in numerous times and can do it right the first time and that can help you watch
