strong\nWomen when it comes to your\nLenny breed\nWelcome back to the bench of\nParish ourselves may have tried it out yet another narrative with regard to the tree of life synagogue shooting and then of course his gun control some people are very angry because Trump right after the attack he said the synagogues need better security or as President Trump media response to the attacks\nYou know if you've had projection is ah the results would have been far better this is just reduce it will always exercise district but they had\nSome kind of a projection is showing the gym\nMaybe you should have been very much difference or Jewish if\nHe is not wrong I Know you got a lot of flak for this because he's he's not talking about anti Semitism right they're not only is he not wrong this has been known widely widely known in the Jewish community for legitimately decades\nFor decades and in France you go to France and go to a Jewish institution every Jewish institution in France to the gate and guard every single one if you go to any place in Europe and it's a synagogue the security there is heavy and security at my synagogue is having we have probably Fifteen synagogues in my immediate area the security at all of them is having\nIt depending on where I was met by now has a security fence all the way around it and does not leave the door in law is that bad yet is it reality also yes when I pick up a school for my children a Jewish day school for my children\nThat are filled certain philosophical commitment obviously but within that band they're a bunch of schools in the area that that do that very first thing that I look at the first thing I asked about it the security consideration at those schools paying two thousand one I remember on September eleventh two thousand one\nMy father and I were actually set to go golfing that morning and we drove up to a a school where my sisters were going and we drove up and they didn't really have security that wasn't a thing back in two thousand one so much and they asked if we can just stand outside we were the extra security that day on nine eleven\nThat very soon end it right after nine eleven they upped security significantly and that was true for every Jewish institution that I knew about it is true\nFor virtually every dish institution in the United states\nNow one of the reasons that I suspect that wasn't additional security at the conservative synagogue is because conservative informed synagogues\nTypically don't have quite the same security as orthodox and a dog I'm I'm not sure why that is I don't really have an ideological reason or philosophical reason for that all I can say that if you go to Beth Jacob in Los Angeles they actually check everybody's dad and this has been part of a Jewish reality for a very long time that mean that I feel unsafe know again I Walk around in public with a um a guy every single day\nEvery single day Americans the case that country in world history for his\nBut if you actually want to protect you is the answer is not to take that they had the guns out of the hands of people like me why are they had the people at my synagogue or carrying the answer is for some of those people the arm is that if somebody like the shows up maybe it's not the solution maybe it doesn't solve the problem but you do have a better shot bending yourself there are guns in the place so for folks who are using this as a\nGun control argument I'm having a hard time seeing that\nIn California is replete with gun control and it doesn't actually stop shootings in California I Know because I live here\nThe the the attempt to jump to politics from something that has had a long and glorious history of thousands of years I find deeply off but we ought to delve into the nitty gritty of anti Semitic rhetoric and the nitty gritty of ants that policy we ought to delve into all of that\nBut for Jews Jews know that this is nothing new not only is nothing new this is something that Jews have always fought\nNow on the Saturday that this happened the Jews were reading a section of the Bible called virus from from the book of genesis and that that can Bible talks about Abraham sacrifice by the you know they got to labor him go sacrifice her son very cryptic section of the Bible that really got to think ... what are you willing to risk\nAre you willing to bring your child into a more dangerous world and scan for values even at the risk of that childlike removed dedicate your child to me that happened in Britain Miller which is the circumcision ceremony for a Jewish boy that brings them into the Jewish world\nThe Jewish people have always stood up and they said yes they're willing to stand with life and the free elections that are willing to stand with life and because they're willing to stand with like there are those who want that there are those who want western civilization broken down there are those who want religion destroyed their people who are evil out there\nThe Jews have stood against that they use will continue to stand against us and and if you are part of the right side and you will stand against it too\nAnd you'll do so without maliciously tearing down people who are also on the side of western civilization there should be more unity than ... with regard to stuff like that there should be well we'll be back here tomorrow

that if Eric Holder never professed any kind of you know I'm a belief system is probably goes to church I'm sure but you know Jeff Sessions southern boy he grew up in a church so you're not going to quote scripture to Jeff Sessions and get them out of his game okay that's the point I'm trying to make this a Jeff\nSessions comes back and he says there's nothing in my theology that says a secular nation key words here secular nation and he actually says secular nation state\nCannot pass laws on immigration and then protect and defend those law\nAnd and so what he's saying is that our country yes we do everything we can to help people this country you don't know why they call us ... the shining light on a hill because we help people we bring refugees in from other countries right here's

nations I\nCannot have lawful laws to control\nImmigration in this country that's what we're talking about [noise]\nAnd that's what he said it just I mean he's right\nWe take care of people were not a mean spirited evil country our people are wonderful I got a story here that was going to talk about later bring it up right now the how great this country as the shooter in a synagogue shooter you remember him this evil despicable anti Semite racist who doesn't deserve the breed the same areas you and I\nJust got a shot up a synagogue you'll be tell you something\nYou can have hate in your

the best looking in a very good with the ladies if they're when they're men and last but not least they have mental health issues\nAnd by definition of you hate other people simply because they're black or Jewish or Hispanic or differently than you are you are a mental health health case let's be clear here\nIf you hate people to the point of violence because there are different than you you are by definition a nut case I don't want to sugarcoat that at\nAll if you walk around here saying oh I hate the blacks I hate the Jews I hate this Mannix simply because they're black users bags or if you're black and you walk around saying I hate white man I hate this ... or you walk around like this you are by definition a mental health nut case\nYou're lonely you're depressed and you we we

that's the proper way to uh to look at these situations are these events happen because these people are deranged\nI'm the person who shot and Gabby Giffords for these are the range to people and and that is what we need to look at\nThe end I don't I don't see a patch on politics so this is helpful at all in one case we had a Trump supporter carrying them out in the other case where the Trump opponent carrying something out so I Know\nList what we have seen though with all of these incidents is an increase in and really dangerous and ugly radicalization as disturbed individuals on line and I think that is something that we need to look at the same exact path as I say he's is to create people overseas we're seeing that here\nUm with dangerous homegrown extremists and these types of events are on the rise and that is something you know you can talk about the tone at the top of the general political discourse that there was something really ugly going on on the Internet\n[noise] see that's the start of it that's the start of it that's how they lay the groundwork so then she says that statement\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center then comes behind their funded by George Soros those groups they come behind and they start to tell people because they're the they're the clearing house of who's hate speech is\nWho who who who's a hate groups there the ... they're the go to grill so now they become a political power for the law\nBecause they get the call every one Family Research council had to sue there was an anti ... and there was an anti radical Islam\nGroup who fought against radical Islam they call them anti Muslim that groups sued to get their name back and won the lawsuit\nSo what happens is when you say what she said that the end\nThe hate speech on line then you have the Southern Poverty Law Center which is a known political left leaning oh go after everything on the right type of group saying that your group is hate is a hate group and I watch is labeled a hate group by them now you're able to ban the speech on social media did you see how they do it\nThis is why\nI I'm Sorry man I just saw yeah I I I hate to couch it in these terms but this is what\nWe see every day we see these things going on and then you call those crazy for senior you call a Saturday\nOh these people they're conspiracy theorists Shelley went to the conspiracy theorists what\nI'm watching you I've seen that done before I've seen it won't examples same sex marriage we said okay\nYou're going to make a a platform that marriage is not defined as marriage
