Churchill said some very nasty things during his career things we would consider nasty now\nThat he he'd racial score on a variety of groups ranging from the Indians to the like from India to the Sudanese to certain Asian tribes both the left has done is they've taken those comments out of context to suggest that he was complicit in genocide in Burma which is not true to suggest that he wanted to ask people which is also not true\nAnd he wanted to he suggested using tear gas against people just save their lives as opposed to using bullets actually a and a and you know the ... so they they take all the stuff out of context\nThis has relevance today not only because it demonstrates the extremism of the left that we're now at the point where you're not allowed to quote Winston Churchill but explains why\nThere's this big fight that is now taking place over Columbus Day on the left the perspective as the Columbus days ... western civilization is bad and so we must celebrate indigenous people's day on the day the Columbus discovered has been yellow and on the right to perspective is Christopher Columbus and the west have committed a lot of sense but it is an eminently good thing for the world that western civilization found the western hemisphere\nThat's the basic argument it's really not about Columbus is about the value of western civilization that's really a route that is what the argument is about we'll be back here tomorrow with all of\nThe latest I'm sure it will just be more insanity over here to break it down for you this is the bench Hiroshima\n[noise] McCain PM moving dot com why why Gainesville stay with\nGun so to\nAmerican dreamers [noise]\nAs far as\nTo show Halloween is right around\nAnd many of you are starting to decorate you're starting to put a decorations on your homes and\nWith Syria to adhere to\nWe've covered talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nUnder it and I find myself saying it seems like they're going to have you seen\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you want to fifty year old male maybe it would be for you or even with type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month for double term life insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big Lou and eight hundred for a one at\nFourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big lewd dot com\nRemember big lose IQ he's on meds to\nComing up at seven thirty we have the attorney for the young lady for the parents of the five year old girl who was the costs they fired gender fluid boy right here in Georgia city to cater schools where the attorney coming on at seven thirty on a show\nYou or do you use an tattoos every weekday morning from nine to ...

of little pieces well that's what happens that happens in China and set the first time I'm I'm reading the rest of the story\nAnd I'm finding out this happens throughout China all the time kids are caught using their phone in school during\nClass and the teacher gives them a hammer on break or something to smash the phone and the parents are perfectly OK with this\nNow there's a debate on line this story says but the debate all along was with American the Chinese parents are completely okay with this and I wanted to ask are you okay with this if this happens to your kid and I think he is a problem if you're not okay with it is this the problem\nWhy we're being beat by so many other countries because we allow our children to break the law or break the rules\nAre handle it when I get home

don't want to tell us to break it was a teacher is going to have to buy a brand new song\nThey don't want your kid what about your kid messing up in class and and and and use it and you know playing

pressed on that and\nThey responded by defending that the Obama ... transgender policy required them to allow him to be there\nSo let me ask you what is the policy what is the policy that spans are in the dictator schools and old coals all hers excuse me elementary school in Decatur, Georgia\nIt is a district by policy was created by superintendent duty\nAnd it was not done in in the public it was done through private ah memos and emails but the school board and it it is to actually says if a for instance a boy self identifies as a girl\nHe used to be allowed in restrooms showers locker rooms the girls restrooms the girl showers through the girls locker rooms and to be allowed to room with a girl if a if there is on there on a school trip\nAnd always try out for girls sport teams isn't as ... as a reverse fruit for\n... for female identifies as a male she's allowed to do everything in a boy's locker rooms and so on and that is\nCorrect It's it's it's either way yes\nBut this is an elementary school so I'm not understanding so you're telling me that uh what are the ages five six seven eight years old is that elementary school\nElementary school but to be an even from kindergarten to I Believe fifth or six in that school district it might be fourth or fifth grade\nSo I don't want a tree school so agenda for young man wants to go into the girl shower he would get naked place ward's get naked of going to the girl show we're all his private parts showing to the girl sort of girls\nThat that is what the that is but this policy would would authorize that is correct\nWhy would why would people do this\nI don't know why they're\nDoing\nSomeone loses their common sense it's hard to undo it understand my ... if you'd have to ask if it's a ... it's a

Thomas talking and I have another clip coming from it\nYou say that parents are another ... a set of parents in this video who said they had no clue but this was going on\nThat is correct so it was it was put in place but through a ... and that was an amendment was was circulated\nIn private emails to to the school board between the superintendent it would not put on that on the school board agenda but not voted on in public when it was women's implemented it was all done in the dark and so finally uh after President Trump that the Trump Administration had rescinded the bonnet\nTransgender policy uh apparently to pretend to duty felt sort of need to place this policy on his Facebook page\nAnd it was that at that point that other parents discovered\nIt and they began to raise their objections they were they were understandably very concerned and back these particular parents have to have a daughter in high school and they they\nCould organize O'Hare says yeah go ahead this is throughout potato schools all went through high school from elementary middle to high school every schools under the same policy\nEvery school this part of the city schools have Decatur gotcha okay

something like ... he would be there to the end you at a heartbeat\nYeah OK I'm here in Canada okay I clearly she and I appreciate your coming blaming explain\nThe reason things like this happen is when Shelley says things like yeah he loves Bill Cosby and supports Bill Cosby and then oj I should never be considered guilty because he wasn't he wasn't found guilty or innocent you know he sort of

Kennedy violate the norms of the presidency when he passed off as a young and turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered the Nixon and violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water great in line did he violated how 'bout Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the President's Day so please save me the embarrassment of trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency is if Obama and Bush and Clinton and Bush\nAnd LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms of the presidency please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to um hey thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley to your role that he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities your water to produce any direction they encourage it causes much trouble are great courage\nI just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me have shown as your question talking about the norms ... listen to a liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker did he violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did the eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate did a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think their behavior was extremely heinous\nAnd I think that you\nKnow age has no marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenties sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November owning a member of the eight twenty sixteen men I might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election and are having they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as I say stack\nHow about accepting the results of the election whether it's the Russian collusion delusion or what whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should resign as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as she could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama but what happened is\nThat that uh one Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amyloid abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be tonight\nAnd at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nUp all this as abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is a normal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nOr I'm with you and I also did test the fact that they will not acknowledge anything good\nAnything good that's good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has done\nDonald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm aren't perfect you know he never did that so he tries he tried hard hard working man for a million that doesn't have to do it right I have ultimate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAt that too is sick today\nSharon we got to run thank you for your call from Pennsylvania is Chuck Schumer which they get out and vote if you do not one Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to be controlling the legislative agenda for the last half of the president's first term get out and vote must continue with more

twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated\nAnd she told the therapist that there were four boys who tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that happened I Believe something fundamentally bad happened ... Ford which is why she's been seeking mental health for all these years\nAnd probably what she told the therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that\nTried to rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties it became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold a therapist\nWho rented a room in our house that caused sort of put the second front door in her house so patients come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago now for Bush tried to rape me in the in my late teens\nAnd the mid Nineteen eighties and then sell 'em out in her mind to get fame or to get money\nShe decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys she said it was one instead of late teens that while I was Fifteen set of the mid Nineteen eighty let's make it Nineteen eighty two and so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime dying Feinstein's office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage them require her to come forward\nAnd won the Senate said when the Senate said will come to you in

witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely

the co chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio I think about my beautiful little granddaughter I Want to protect the women around me and make sure they have all the rights privileges and

misdemeanors committed while in office\nSo he's been in office one day this morning that his first couple hearings and the Democrats already wondering with peach\nAnd they don't want to teach them what they want to do is raise money to use and Heidi Heitkamp straits in North Dakota for example or Joe Donnelly and Indiana and that's what they want to do they are threatening to impeach when they're never going to do that because it wouldn't fly you need fifty one percent of the of the house and two thirds of the Senate would never happen\nAnd and the guy if there's a God and having the Republicans will keep the Senate for weeks Trump tonight will know better\nThat are so that the federal judges the pipeline can't continue but imagine the absurdity of the modern Democratic Party when having had his first day on the bench and the Democrats want to impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nUnbelievable let's continue our son and the great state of Texas where the cowboys can't win Sonny welcome to the markets have been show Sonny please go ahead\nOh I'm a\n... or ... or ... or ... or ... or ... or ... or ... or the ... so to go the route of Ku Klux Klan\nYou know it's funny you bring up an excellent point you know that the party of the confederacy\nIs and was the Democratic party there are the ones who declared civil war on my country and killed about six hundred thousand total soldiers so the Democratic party is the part of the Ku Klux Klan\nAnd the party of Jim Crow Democratic Party is the party of lynchings\nThe Democratic party is the party of the destruction of public education currently and the welfare system\nIt's responsible for most of the criminal disasters as say like in the city of Chicago the Democratic party from reconstruction the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow lynchings collapse of public education in fact about eight percent\nDetroit or Chicago public school students that are African American rated the appropriate level and so you're talking about a massive dumbing down of the population to keep them on the modern plantation which\nIs the Democratic party so sunny that preserved behavior you're seeing from Democrats has been repeat it for the past hundred and fifty years some cold than the demon rats they're not Democrats or the demon rats and what what we're seeing the restaurants and the\nAnd the airports in the elevators today it's mild compared to what the Democrats did of the Nineteen sixties burning down about a hundred American cities so I wouldn't put a lot past them because Democrats are now shooting us congressmen other Republican so wherever I look I see the disaster the modern Democratic Party\nNot covered by the mainstream media sunny do you agree I'm like well\nMy son and we got to run thanks for your call his continue with more let's go to Jim in Brooklyn I Love Brooklyn Jimmy in Brooklyn welcome to the Mark Sullivan show Jimmy go ahead\nGreat to hear you again listen when we hear about the radical left the far left we see what's going on and the schools we see the crime you see on TV for\nThis is the result of liberalism now let me give you some quotes from the communist training manuals the communist right use the system to destroy the system the communists right the best way to help the cause of communism is through the liberal wing of the Democratic party\nThe communist right yesterday is left is today's center today's left will be tomorrow center that talking about the whole American political system moved to the left\nSo they have a highly organized well trained group with in the Democratic party that the strategist a tactician\nThere are a lot of our professors there are a lot of our teachers there are a lot of our congressmen and senators so what do you see the Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian probe you see the violence in ... and all this stuff that's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy let me explain there's the also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration that was traditional tip telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so the organizers left inside the federal government would release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against him from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here\nThe senator from Beijing this is foreign influence in our government a foreign agent of red China like a congressman Dianne Feinstein she's the one that started this big hoopla about a a judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh are allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than their numbers and we're actually I think a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nI I never thought I Would embrace a political guy as much as I I I Love Trump\nToo and in fact job in fact look at it this way that radical Democratic Party has United the Republican Party I never thought I Would ever say good things about Senator Susan Collins I didn't think it was
