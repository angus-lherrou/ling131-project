I I don't know if I misunderstood you weren't you talking about the guy Colorado to kill to stay in the early yeah what do you yes based you oughta Lola humanely they gave me the needle and let me do it myself\nWell you know they they're saying now that he was having an affair with some girl at work\nAnd yeah ... and apparently he asked his wife for a separation and then I we're assuming that's what started some kind of a fight and that's when the police believe me just killed her and but I\nI don't understand any I don't I don't know how you can kill a four year old and thirty thirty three year old your own daughters monster ... if he strangled others bare hands are I mean I just God\nI Can't I Can't imagine Colorado\nHead of the death penalty or we know\nI don't you know I'm not sure I I used to they used to have the firing squad Gary ... thank you I Pretend to do if I if I'm not mistaken he wasn't very well maybe that was Utah they might have been Utah to say that I think what is your ... and his firing squad yeah\nI don't know where the Colorado has a death penalty I I don't know but this I mean that's not good enough for this guy how do you like to me the woman he was having an affair with only ... family over you know I Believe is reinstated in Nineteen Seventy four okay there you go well good\n'cause he certainly qualifies for death by avalanche and you're right the ski slopes he's he now he's claiming that he came home to find one of his daughters dead and the other one being strangled by his wife and that's why he snapped in a fit of rage and killed his wife and revenge\nOf the prosecutors aren't buying that but that's a record I mean he just thinking about it I just can't imagine I could kill your own three and four year old daughter's three thirty one\nNewspaper lines coming up hold on here's Ryan on the new talk one of the six seven oh Ryan how's it going\nPretty good so along with I can listen you're in every so often but some calls to all

had a dream that would freeze me I had a dream that I was trapped inside a closet and there was something in the wall I never made me since I was holding the wall or something in the wall and I was so scared him I\nDon't think you're in the closet [laughter]\nNot to\nNot vote here on a bad\nGuy and now and then\nIt was like do you stand they used to have an old circus act where the guy would get up in a like a two hundred foot pole\nAnd then they would win with orange and it was like now you're in a row\nWell it was part of a natural\nIt was part of a bathroom and I would go in the bathroom and

they signed up for a subscription to get a magazine I guess he's gay magazines [laughter] you know I don't mean to some guy who was\n... was doing the thing with them so you can give you a a for for ... for a century so by the way I mentioned the reason I mentioned this lucid dreams is now there's a way to try to have you trigger a loose a dream where you know you're dreaming in your part of it uh it and you you can kind of control to research at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and the Institute in Hawaii\nAre investigating chemicals recalled inhibitors that promote Lucy dreaming they moderate Rehman sleep the deep sleep\nOr they had a hundred and twenty participants seemed drugs had in their dreams the more they took the more they had lucid dreams\nThey would practice your dream induction techniques have the pill to then go back to sleep and it would trigger lucid dreams are available to they're trying to see if this was available to a wider population in other to perhaps help people deal with things like nightmares called LSD\nThat's another whole issue entirely on the news ... news regular air a good afternoon\nAnd the name of the father of the name of the sun and the holy ghost some action from the pope is what people want more going away for a narrowly wonderful ...\n... when I just are being blasted for waiting so long to speak out against decrease handling Pennsylvania a long wait for it and then only delivering a bunch of words that won't be followed by any action\nSort of like President Trump when he goes on Twitter and winds about Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein and Christopher Wray who he is in his power to fire there or at least tell him to do their job so I think you'd want to make the action or folks here's an idea [laughter]\nOn Twitter they condemn the pedophile priests like Trump people will be actually think I'm doing something you know it gets ...\n\nBreaking does take time [laughter]\nAnd I asked ... years\nSo he ... Bugs Bunny and Sean Hannity ... ... miles but I don't I don't care where my kids that anyway Yes sir where was that oh\nFinally [laughter] you know my letters or friend Jamie decided to walk to the end of the world to prove it's flat proven you and me and he came around came around the only thing a flat earth or is that the fear is fear itself fear fear ... yeah oh God\nWe made a\nSolver he's the cameras show when we play [laughter]\nThose dot our most illicit or a replay of of the cameras show or why not what the hell else so I got to do [laughter] we used to give her as a job three to six [laughter] every afternoon ... new talk ...\nThis is the rubber now shock loose Bush you know by show he's brought you by Democrat attorney general nominee Keith Allison Keyes beat his opponent so badly I figured it had to be a woman that had did his show host determine our hourly tribute\nTo the British show here on the news on one of those six seven we know where to butter I've read in your chosen chosen or you\nMay not\nHave they have a radio\n\n\nLaw we\nWe do use on the radio and say hey you know they have\nWhen I\nSays oh\n\nSee you already have\n\nLong long long usually it will\n\nWin me what you mean or anything to\nThe\nBall over\nIn ...\nThe way Mr manager\nTo get so by the fifty seven or the new talk what six seven eight for for for all for ten sixty seven what a sad story this is and I only I just I hate to even to talk about an eleven year old boy in Iowa named Caleb Hammond\nHas leukemia he's been undergoing painful treatments at a Des Moines hospital for months it's not working other doctors are saying it's not working and we don't really have anything else we can do so the eleven year old kid said you know what screw it I'm going home\nSo he went home and he has a final wish for when he dies he's eleven and he's making final wishes\nEleven year old Caleb Hammond wants people to send him racing stickers\nHe's loved auto racing since he was two years old healed his passion is what prompted the request for stickers and his uncle says the stickers have been pouring in after social media appeals trying to keep everybody spirits up\nUh he's been home for about three weeks now and he does what other eleven year old kids do as much as you can but then he gets tired really easily and he's hoping to get some racing stickers to cover his casket\nWhen he dies that's what the eleven year old boy says he wants to racing's tickets are stickers to cover his casket when he died from leukemia God what a heartbreaking story that is\nAnd how about some good news it's also a little sad in some ways to have you seen the video of the reunions of families in North and South Korea holy smokes a Donald Trump by the way is getting full credit for this\nHe arranged between the presidents of north and South Korea to get together to make a deal so that families who are separated during the Korean War are finally getting a chance to meet relatives who were separated from them fifty sixty years ago\nAnd there was video of of of of families women who are in their Seventy five eighty year old range seeing their brothers and sisters for the first time since they were for\nMe and there I mean it's ... will they now have more than one surname ... [laughter]\nWell I think they're all the same name still but can you imagine I mean the video is really is it's really astounding there you know they haven't seen family in sixty years Berlin Wall stuff God\nI mean can you ... and ... and here's the here's the kicker and the sad part about it is that apparently they were given a Donald Trump arrange the meeting to have them get the reunion together but apparently the deal is they are they can meet together in the same spot for three days\nBut they're being limited to only talk with each other actually sit together with each other over the three days for a total of eleven hours\nAnd the reason for that is the north Koreans don't\nWant their people to find out too much about how good it is in South Korea are afraid they'll defect or try to defect but again there at least getting to see the relatives of the first time since Nineteen fifty\nOr even before that when they were separated before the war [noise] a sweetness bell oh man I don't\nThink I'm standing on your show [laughter] [laughter]\nOh pi Justin ... [noise] uh the current level of terrorism threat has announced a thought it required the following announcement up from the French government has just announced that has raised the terror alert level from run to hide the only to higher levels in France [laughter]\n\nThe only the only two levels higher than runner hide in France are collaborate surrender [laughter] who rises precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed Frances White flag factory\n[laughter]\nParalyzing the country's military capability meantime the Spanish or all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy\nThese beautifully designed Spanish subs have glass bottom so [laughter] so the news managed to maybe get a really good luck of the oldest they shouldn't be\nThere's sneaking out Iraq [laughter]\nFour oh one of the new talk what six seven I'm not making this up at Parris Island when I was there a if you were more than about six pounds over what they thought was your weight your called a fat body when I went to Paris island\nI weighed I think I weighed something like two ten maybe to all come up by about two ten\nAnd they wanted me my drill instructor a foot in the first day they are the drone structures put me in the fat body platoon or in the ... which meant when you go to the mess all I Would say fat body so their leaders to the front as well as you go to the front of a child line and the fact buddies had to go to the rear which means you have less time to eat\nBecause you eke by fast I mean there's no goofing around at Parris Island but the key was ... via drill instructors had to look at the food that I Would get on my trade and we're all ... and this is a true story we were only I was only allowed to eat for like the first seven or eight weeks\nAnd then I became a squad leader and and they took over a lot but anyway and for the first seven or eight weeks all I could eat much meat\nVegetables and water no bread no potatoes no pasta Noll salad dressing no milk no

food has a green coat next door to eat as much as you want a yellow means go with caution and a red you know the ... sign next to the food means minimal amount only\nSo that's his excuse\nNow I did hear one person say and I haven't been able to confirm it anywhere else but I heard one reporter uh I think even yesterday say\nThat there was evidence that the children were killed first\nAnd if that's true depending on the timeline I Wonder that whether that will help his story\nThat they were dead before he got home I don't know I mean the whole thing makes me sick [noise]\nNathan's hotdogs now say should boycott because the owners want to Donald Trump's best friend she's been a best ... easy one of his two best friends and the Nathan's hotdog guy is having a fundraiser friday for Donald

president today which is an amazing thing right Brett evens it out as anti Trump and his possible debate he is a true never Trump Republican and he came out in the New York times today and said I Am very very pleased that Donald Trump is president and standing by Brett Kavanaugh\nNow there are a lot of folks on the left and don't seem to understand why folks on the radar so passionate about this issue\nThe original passionate about this issue is because it looks like due process and presumption of innocence had been talk completely unknown a second I'm gonna get to the counter argument being made by some folks I think in good faith folks like Ken Harris on his podcast I'm friendly with them\nAnd we've been having a little bit about text back and forth about that and I don't I'm not really any secret that all this stuff publicly on and talk about that and just a second but the way that Republicans are viewing this like conservatives are feeling this way independence are viewing this is\nA man was accused after thirty six years of allegedly sexually assaulting a girl back when he was Seventeen years old there was no corroborating evidence and Democrats\nAnd to run him out of his life over it and then the media have decided to latch onto every single room or they possibly can in order to prevent cab not from joining the court\nThat is what this looks like anyone I think of objective I don't even think it's conservative and I want to justify the process sucks now there are two separate questions and this is where I think it's worthwhile discussing the most intellectually honest version of the latter case there are two separate questions does the process suck and does Brett Kavanaugh deserve to be on the court\nNow these two issues are not completely separate the process and it stuck edge\nOr one of the reasons why Brett Kavanaugh got himself into a little bit of trouble with regard to his testimony him to talk about the trouble he got himself into with regard was testimony and just a second but the ... of the process is what most people are concerned with at this point because it feels like whatever\nComplaints are being made about Brett Kavanaugh are essentially fruit of the boys in history when you accuse the guy a gang rape and you start going through his your book and then your final case against him is he filmed about stuff in his high school yearbook and that's why he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court that feels like we're the poison history and the worst possible way\nAnd in a second I'm In that case\nAlso it feels like the media are out to get have not because they are ruining barrel has done some really good work on the beach and stuff like some some really excellent work on the meat you stuff\nAnd he completely has undermined his own credibility with regard to Brett Kavanaugh so you recall that we can do the New Yorker piece by Jane Mayer who is not a good reporter and Ronan Farrow who is a good reporter they put out a piece ingesting that a woman and Deborah Ramirez that when she was at Yale was in a broken wrap party and Brett Kavanaugh unzip his pants and exposed himself to her\nAnd that was the accusation it was at a party she apparently considered it for six days because she wasn't sure that you remember that correctly or that it was cabinet and then she came forward and told the story there were no corroborating witnesses well last night the New Yorker sides in order to undermine the credibility of the FBI investigation\nThey are going to come forward with new witnesses to Deborah Ramirez statement\nWell that'd be kind of a bombshell wouldn't it except that not actually what the report said on Wednesday evening New Yorker runs its investigative piece from Iran Ronan Farrow the peace claimed that the FBI investigation into sexual assault claims against Kavanaugh was insufficient what made the investigation into fashion well here's what they said that quote\nFrustrated potential witnesses who have been unable to speak with the FBI agents conducting the investigation into sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had been resorting to sending statements unsolicited the bureau and dissenters in hopes that there would be seen before the inquiry concluded\nThe FBI investigation is just to find science said insufficient because there are a bunch of witnesses who have not been interrogated by the FBI and they've been desperately reaching out the FBI trying to tell their vital story what are they are vital story well\nThe key vital story comes from a new kind of apple and apple according to the New Yorker was a sweet me a break Kavanaugh's at the time the alleged incidents you previously spoken to the New Yorker about Ramirez and condition of anonymity but he said that he is now willing to be identified because he believed the FBI must thoroughly investigator allegation\nApple with James tasting Nichols professor of reformation history at Princeton Theological Seminary so that you first heard about the alleged incident involving cabinet and Ramirez either the night that occurred or a day or two later apple said he was one hundred percent certain that he was told the Kavanaugh was a male student who exposed himself Ramirez\nWell okay that's pretty damn and stuff I mean here's a guy who's saying that he heard about\nCabinet exposing himself at this party so why isn't yesterday talking to him literally the FBI investigation is a ruse clearly it hasn't been done most thoroughly enough and all the rest of it well\nThere's only one problem buried a few paragraphs down there in the story is a little spoiler the completely undermines the New Yorker story I Will explain that were you in just one second\nBut first let's talk about your comfort down below alright you close your eyes imagine yourself in the locker room back in high school were in your current underwear I Know it's just a nightmare in every respect why would you want to be back in high school why would you want to be in the locker room and why would you want to be wearing those ugly ugly underwear\nIf the answer is you wouldn't well then maybe you should try Tommy John revolutionary clothing brand is redefining comfort for men and women\nTommy John obsessing over every little detail in pitch by using fabric to perform like nothing

plus they have their best Perry you'll ever where or it's free guarantee there's no risk involved Tommy John dot com used that political Shapiro for twenty\nPercent off so how does the New Yorker undermine it's OK so they say here's a witness a witness who said she heard about Brett Kavanaugh exposing himself to a girl I Gail now getting to the different allegation then the you tried to sexually\nAssault somebody this is a bad drunken brat antics that is gross but it's not quite the same thing as pressing yourself on a girl and putting your hand over her mouth where there are gradations of evil this one is a little bit lower than the other one but there is a big problem with the New Yorker story will get a New Yorker story says it does is actually what it says in the story quote\nApple said that he initially asked remain anonymous because we hope to make contact first with a classmate who the best of his recollection told them about the party and it was an eye witness the incident he said he had not been able to get any response from that person just by multiple attempt to do show the New Yorker reached a classmate but he said he had no memory of the incident\nSo in other words here's what the New Yorkers reporting here they're big bombshell this guy heard secondhand about a party which cabinet exposed himself without permission to grow\nAnd this guy said I'm not coming forward and so I talk to the guy told me the story the New Yorker actually identified that guy we supposedly witnessed the event and then when they talk to them and that guy said I don't remember anything about that\nWouldn't that actually be the end of the story like in a normal journalistic standard wouldn't that in the end of the story if I if I spoke to somebody and they said I heard a rumor from ... that this happened and he was an eye witness and then I when I spoke to the eyewitness and the I wouldn't have said no no don't remember anything about that\nThat would be the end of the story the New Yorker ran with it anyway because this is the link to which journalists we'll go to sink Brett Kavanaugh's nomination and then that report and the New Yorker gets even worse\nThe New Yorker wrote that some of Kavanaugh's classmate said he was bullied in high school who laughed at other kids there's a quote from New Yorker story\nIn his statement which is attorney there's another\nWitness in his statement which is attorney also sent several members of the Senate Judiciary committee on Tuesday\nHe described cabinet as part of a click of high school athletes most of whom are on the football team will routinely picked on less physically fit or popular students he said he never witness Kavanaugh physically attacking other students but he recalled than doing nothing to stop the physical and verbal abuse instead he said Kevin hosted by and laugh at the victims\nSo what he was a jerk in high school was part of the popular kids click is coming from a guy who was deeply unpopular in high school right I have no sympathy for guys were boys in high school or who stood by what bullying occurred in high school I have no sympathy for that 'cause I was a brutal victim a bully and when I was in high school but\nBeing a victim of bowling does not mean that I think that anyone who was a bully in high school also rape checks\nBut that's the implication from New York are starting to wonder why the right is reacting with outrage to all of this that's why the writers racking outrage coming up Dr Christine\nBlasey Ford's attorneys response to the FBI investigation suffice it to say they are unhappy but the reason they are happier white flame why that region is just like in will take a look at other attempts by Democrats for not having a nomination

hundred watt professors have signed a letter that they sent to the New York times and then sent on to the United States Senate on October ...\nAnd they talk about judicial temperament till case number ... so there are several cases now being brought against Kavanaugh based not on the original allegations of bacon ancillary allegations okay silver one is something that happened to me so I Believe for\nTerrible case illogical make no sense case number two Brett Kavanaugh got mad he got angry\nYou accused him of raping people and then he got angry\nAnd that means that he's not for the court and you use partisanship in order to destroy this man why and then you're mad and called that you're partisanship that means you know part of it they shouldn't sit on the court\nYou know the reason no one cares about the law professors thing because everyone knows the law professors a Democrat I went to Harvard law school you know how many Republicans were on staff at Harvard law school as far as I Know one the number of of actual Republican or conservative in the halls of law school academia are Neal debate with us\nPartisan Democrats signing letters saying they don't like Brett Kavanaugh because he got mad but as long as we are professors who teach research and write about the judicial institutions of the country the question that issue is painful for anyone but judge Kavanaugh dip it exhibited they lack of commitment to judicial inquiry\nUh-huh so women historians RPG Ruth Bader Ginsburg ripped on Trump and says you shouldn't be president that's not partisanship she deserves to

material impact on the course of the investigation that's perjury okay that's not how it works so what are the ... the brick have not supposedly told\nFirst of all it is important to note that all of his testimony was given it in the context of him being accused of a gang rape by a bunch of Democrats and then they were digging through his your book so every claim that has been made about his wise has been that supposedly he downplayed his drinking\nOr lives about his high school yearbook\nLives out of high school you know I'm not going to the front line I'm not going to pretend that of Brett Kavanaugh lied about things I think that makes them squeaky clean well let's go through a list of these opposes lies that Brett Kavanaugh soldiers from Boeing ... going going that far less site and so

letter suggesting that the confidential background investigation of judge Kavanaugh from the FBI prior to hearing not the new one show there was information related in some way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse\nThere weren't a vague letter saying that there was some information of inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse and his prior FBI background check is only one problem he wasn't that the single question that his original confirmation hearing about inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse\nAnd by using the phrase by phrasing it such that the Democrats were saying that in the past FBI background check there was evidence of quote inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse that somehow the Democrats knew something they weren't telling us all turned out they didn't know any which is completely an surprising because that's where we are at this point\nIn time no wonder the Republicans are United on that Lindsey Graham\nWho has turned into something

our tickets are still available for the chit chat laws to her who's going to be on this Sunday in Marietta\nOh what a what hotel is that going to be ...\nOh my God you now you know you're putting me on the spot I'll get off I'll tell them area that's a nice hotel and there's also ...\nDot com quake on chit chat or are you a the the location and everything right their\nDoors open at four o'clock and at some point in this next five minutes I'm going to give away a pair of tickets for you and the gas or to go on Sunday and ...\nUm what are you guys going to be talking about this Sunday on a chit chat to lie to her\nWell I Know we should only gonna be talking about Kavanaugh's at what's happening with him but merely care to assassination they have hot that he out the door up because the left are upset and they want to continue to kill babies that's what this really is about let's let's call it ... the good\nThing you think this is all about abortion and nothing else\nOh absolutely absolutely absolutely they get in the streets they create chaos and they act so ignorant it's just it's very sad and what I hate this is what really bothers me they've taken that me too movement\nAnd they polled where the size it and they use that as a weapon and weaponize that against somebody with an impeccable records to Saturday they have tried to destroy his legacy try to destroy his name off for the sake of killing babies\nWow and so if they do it to him my argument has been throughout this entire process if they can do it to him because my thing that I I find so eerily so scary to me especially with my social media is a number\nOf men who are or who are siding with this kind of accusations are all you need to destroy your man's life and I'm like why would you side with that\nAbsolutely okay so let's take it back and I don't want to make anybody feel uncomfortable let's go back to Nineteen fifty five with him it Dale ... now all of their way to come to find out the lady lot about that right and we'll say allegedly just in case I ain't got all the facts right\nLet's look at what happened here and two thousand five uh two thousand six right here in North Carolina where a black woman accused have white lacrosse do do players\nRaping her come to find out it wasn't true and see how they life was ruined for that right you see what I'm saying so that's why those accusations allegations without adequate information it's merely accumulation okay and you can't take speculation\nAnd with that and make somebody guilty based on speculation in this country we are innocent until proven guilty not the other way around\nIt absolutely now I got another bit of piece of news here tell me about what's going to happen\nOr do you hear about the attorney James Baker for the FBI to a spoken closed session um and he comes out and says that ... a law firms the DNC and uh the uh the Hillary Clinton campaign that basically all these guys who looted going back as far as September two thousand sixteen\nWere meeting with the FBI FBI so polluted bring down Trump yeah\nAnd all of them should be arrested don't ask don't collect ... dollars\nThey need to all be arrested you know because when you look at what's happening in our country does look like fancy landscape a justice to me well you can just go in and they just hold a kangaroo court or whatever you want to do that and you can't do that in this country\nAnd some people are going to have to pay the price and if they were colluding to try to break out Trump campaign\nTried to enter fan and elected don't blame you try to interfere in this election and let's say you know what we need to let justice prevail you talk a lot of people thought anyway you need to be prosecuted to the fullest and other law\nWhere you think I maintain here on my show that the one thing that will divide Trump from his base I see an old time no one not not one of us have left Trump side not a single one of us he is not he's only gain support is not lost any from his base\nI say but I I maintain that the only thing that can actually move support for Donald Trump is president from his base is not getting any prosecution from these dirty players if he comes out and says well we're going to let them go or let's smooth things over we want to come together do you agree with that statement\n[noise] well you know I don't know I don't know what you're basically saying is that if it comes out that that that okay the president is clean that he is saying quote by yeah and you think people are going to get mad if he's saying quote by that what you're\nTrying to I'm trying to say if he doesn't walk these people love that committed wrongdoing and high levels I'm not talking about the lives of pages of the world I'm Talking about the high level a lock up or do you think the base I think the base will be upset because that's what we will\nBe upset but he's not a little from that but he was ... but I'm\nBut I Do believe that he should let the law take its course if these people commit a crime they do need to be locked up\nAbsolutely so now Sunday Sunday at four o'clock to get to her um when people get their ... do you guys talking do you have any special guest that you're going to be talking to\nYou know what we normally don't talk to special gas unless it's somebody in the audience that we see oh we notice or somebody that's doing something we may call 'em out but normally you just getting all of ... minutes so you're getting the raw raunchy diamond and feel good that we not politically correct but I'll
