a story where a a ... for the whole stabbed his civilian yeah yeah\nRight I encounter that individual about two days prior and he was holding out a fly on a guide on and said I'm a badge I said I was just shaking my head me she turned across the street subject for me to hear the taste of white ones because they are shaking my head [noise] um\nWhat what are you talking about to take it over city streets I see this video and there's a cop standing by watching individuals who beat up on cars stopping city streets would explain what's going on\nThat [noise] [noise] the mayor told the police to

believe it's forcing pedophile pedophile being Harvey Milk they've decided to rename the street and um they've been there for two weeks now and it's time to let the city have street back it's ridiculous\nHow is it possible that a few dozen antifa protesters can take over an intersection in the downtown area of the city for you're telling me weeks and the police do nothing about it\nBasically for the most part they let them do bell dog jaw they're talking about and then they decided to grow up at the end of a workday I don't know what the what what what the motivation as they just pick and choose what they want to do\nI'm saying is it covered in the news or people angry about what's going on\nKnowing about ... or the or the left slammed up here unfortunately we don't really have a non biased news network\nSo you don't have television condemning this kind of misbehavior they cover it is if they have a valid point\nOther than our local conservative talk show radio
