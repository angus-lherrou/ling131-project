I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most of them at best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself as a standalone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand I huge apples but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get with purity or why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that needs to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D\nJust like your ancestors used to store it so if you're a level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to think of vitamin D as a mountain spring\nWith a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone and we've taken enough item and data halfway fill up that calcium and\nBone pool but all the other pools below with the breath pool the cold and pull the immune system pull all the other polls that are blow it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the pancreas out all these pools\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit for a rainy day\nAnd a little bit of a surplus yeah but you don't do that unless you're levels around fifty if you're levels less than around fifty you use up almost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation well and that's not a good thing\nBy the way down to ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three ... three bottles fish oil both of these are thirty days supplies\nAnd all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat is the phone number one eight hundred six five zero seat to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight\nTo zero now doctors now talk to me about the link between vitamin D and ... what's the research showing\nThat is maybe fifty studies out there that show real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D the less you with but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues think lose that we know what about mood that is people who live closer to the equator way less than people\nWho live far away from the people who live at higher altitude closer the sun way less than people who live at lower altitudes most people experience with people way less than the summer\nThan they do in the winter so those were clues but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D levels so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ... that's become clear just recently for example a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last\nYear they studied women were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and take lost more weight than the women really at the lower vitamin D intake yes\nAnd then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial is the highest standard of proof we have and that is and this was thirty six thousand people\nAnd they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D so we don't have any idea what the full effect is but the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take ... to Monday\nSo that's another reason plot\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the official ... you know of course that there's research that shows the fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reason to believe the two things together will help now it's not a diet till it's not dramatic he won't just stop eating\nPart of that that is you just feel better you're more active you're under doing something\nNow don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe that so vitally important did they give this formula try\n[noise] well you know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health colon hill breast health prostate health

a moment easier to tell us about a major breakthrough in the field of health\nAnd beauty it's all about a prescription medicine long used in Europe that manages main related health issues both functionally and cosmetically\nWe're talking things like those visible veins on the legs like spider rains\nAll the way up to issues like those occasional emirate flare ups in fact this is so popular in Europe that literally millions of people are prescribed and have been for many years well the big breakthrough is going to explain here shortly is that this is now available in the U.S in the form of a prescription free\nDietary supplement called new for print brought here by purity products and when you hear what this can do while you're going to be amazed\nSo joining us to explain all the details all the great science is bill ... bills and author and he's also a high level advisor in product developer for purity products a leading direct to consumer provider of cutting edge specialty supplements for more than twenty five years bill we on a lot of ground to cover today Welcome aboard\nWe do and it's all from Mother Nature and purity product list is nova print and of course\nGet the idea right away it's something that relief discomfort\nWill build at best sounds exciting right off the bat but let's get right down to business millions of Americans both men and women are dealing with issues related to their vein health\nWhether it's unsightly spider beans swelling in the legs and the company that comes along with it or occasional hemorrhage bottom line we've got tens of thousands of miles of beans running through our body and like everything else they endure the wear and tear up the gene\nAnd it seems like no one's really talking about this issue much less offering options\nHelped manage it so what's the problem and watch this breakthrough from Europe\nWell the breakthrough of course this prescription in Europe one over the counter here and of course it's been used for fifty years safely will expand on that as we talk a little bit more about it and what is it\nWell it's a wonderful well tested citrus peel extract it tight stain\nIt hookers them up so that they were will work to push that what we've got red hoses the blue hose arteries and the pain that we've got to push that the oxygen aided blood it where does it pool obviously in the bottom half of our body\nAnd it's got to get pushed up through and back to the heart and if those pains are weak and the the blood pools we'd only have a these problems unsightly Bain spider ... we have a whole issue of circulation\nGot to get that circulate station going and the uh aside from standing on your head the\nWay to do it is new va print HD now we mean I Do that is that does the same does that they used in these wonderful clinical studies that they're laid out all over my desk here so I can remind myself up all the wonderful science it's been done over the years since the Nineteen seventies\nOn a wonderful citrus peel extract that helps your veins get strong so they can do the work of pushing and getting that circulation back to your heart against other than your circulation is optimal and you know this the ingredients in this wonderful up new for print HD\nAlso helps your blood vessels white it creates it little gas called nitric oxide we'll talk about it a little more but

we need this great circulation so it works in more than one way\nBill I Know this is much more than just a cosmetic issue but there's no doubt spider beans were those visible veins you see on the legs are definitely a big issue for both genders may be more for women\nI sometimes see ads for those creams the promise to reduce spider beans and they're not cheap so I think you've hit the jackpot with this appeal to directly address the issue especially if it's helping to address the underlying cause\nCertainly does because what we have here when we see spider veins\nThere there's a lack of circulation in that area on the legs and so it's making new ones to tried to branch out and make sure that this is all happening so\nWe we want them to receipt of course and we live in an era when there should be happening because we become stationary we call it sedentary\nSitting at desks or a great deal at the time were not\nWalking and moving our legs and it's actually the muscles in our cats\nThat are actually squeezing on the plane and then there are one way check valves in our veins so the the the blood only goes one direction but new va print HD addresses the real root cause of this but the issue is it should be happening that the main should be strong enough\nTo make sure that that led doesn't cool and it does get pushed back\nInto the heart so that we can get oxygen aided blood so this is an issue of circulation and we certainly want\nTo promote good circulation address the real cause and of course what's interesting is in Europe\nIt's been used for fifty years well documented and of course it's affordable and today purity product is offering the audience a chance to even try it for free so we have a wonderful ...\nThe the ingredient is the citrus peel extract

capillaries the capillaries or the connector is between the red and blue hoses and that's where the\nOxygen is exchange where nutrients get in were waste material comes out and those can actors can get loose and therefore uh and and so on will explain more of that as we go on but certainly this wonderful remedy from purity products nouveau print\nHDTV from purity product is the answer\nTo the cause of what\nIs the origin of these spider thing even ham rights 'cause that's the main problem also and certainly we're sitting all day you may have symptoms and uh certainly\nAddresses it and the
