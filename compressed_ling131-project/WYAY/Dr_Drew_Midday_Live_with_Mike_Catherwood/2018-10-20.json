Sandra berry because\nIn a Chinese herbal there's some ... Sandra is often added to ginseng\nA really to extend it affects uh shows Andrew has been\nOh cultivated for a couple thousand years and in China and its traditional uses to increase energy a to fight for tea gets a sexual tonic um it also shows benefits for athletes in terms of enhancing physical performance and endurance\nI mean it's just one of the greatest of all botanical so we've found a

Sarah boost extract a is significant enough\nTo boost mental function in clearly defined ways in just two hours\nBut in addition we also have good science showing that with the Korea engines saying extract there's a reduction in stress hormones than the blood and an improvement and function so the ginseng extract that we have in the triple ginseng formula\nWe can say with certainty that it's really a mind sharp and there and you know I I I'm always amazed that people will say go into a coffee place and spend you know four dollars on a lot to say and maybe they'll do that every day and yeah they get a little bit of benefit you know a little bit of caffeine\nBut you get so much more for so much less money on a daily basis\nBy taking something like this tripled ginseng which works in

energy some of that you know I can last all day doing whatever I Need to get done\nA and this really is an edge this is an advantage especially considering that you know we're constantly having to perform whether it's just running the errands for the day or the pressures of work so this this does boost health and vitality and the great news is you feel it\nNeed me alive [laughter] well

say oh I don't know Twenty years ago\nThat listen if you answered yes to any of these questions than stay tuned Dr Neil Lebanese joining us today to discuss a miraculous compound with hundreds of clinical studies that just may unlocked the key to helping you get stronger\nAnd healthier at any age now Dr ... eleven is a chiropractor a nutritionist spokesperson and a longtime advisor for purity products ducked eleven welcome back to the show\nOh it's great to be here with you today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover today packed they were talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features an exciting molecule called Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about pre teen it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass\nOn the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nThat amazing stories can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being Eighteen strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their higher energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had all this stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea teen in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nHe goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger\nYou get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea teen for years to enhance strengthen performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used it body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports\nNutrients so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThat came out the officially confirmed and I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in space stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out the naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red\nMeat and like four pounds of red meat a day most people aren't going to do that right and what about vegetarian it can be Korea teen deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy deficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on a younger person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general or you have more of a vegan style diet this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nRight so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus or like you and me pat and Fred let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gal so hey\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular\nOlder men study done it several American University is\nA group of men get this pet age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys on ... on four pounds\nOf lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that\nIt shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat they could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationary bike pat this happened in one week when I think that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAlright but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well will actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies get stronger to\nArabs are loosely let's go straight to another study love the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older women\nPublished in the European Journal of applied physiology thirty women eight fifty to Seventy one the course they could either Korea the inter placebo that's the way they do these things again a one week study the women on Korea to increase their bench press by almost four pounds they increased their leg press by over ...\nPounds and they had better balance and agility so fifty to Seventy one year old woman not only getting stronger not only getting more powerful\nGetting faster with improved bounds pet study after study shows that older folks that use Korea Team\nGet amazing results they get great results if they exercise they get great results even if they don't\nExercise they can live more weight they get faster they get stronger they get more powerful their muscles don't fatigue as fast and get this this is very important especially for the ladies pet you know that when women do resistance training their bones get stronger as well right\nNow get this when you resistance training with Korea Team your bones tend to get stronger even faster so it all around when when every strong is going to help the seniors to feel better feel stronger more energized more powerful faster and it helps protect your phone\nTalk more about how unique this exclusive ever strong formula is from purity product it even has a finished product clinically studied which showed an increase in upper body strength and power but tell me what's in it and why you like it so much I mean this is more than just creating right\nOh absolutely I mean average drawn this is a very comprehensive formula pat I didn't want people to just feel
