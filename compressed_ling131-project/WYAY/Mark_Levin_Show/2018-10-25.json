studio\nWhy why\n... plus the packages targeting CNN former President Obama Hillary Clinton and others according to investigate or one of the devices was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan incentive CNN renting believe President Trump's rhetoric help steel such action\nI think one can make an argument that it has embolden individuals to take matters into their own hands and so when he complements individuals who have insects body slammed others for that he's going to pay the legal bills if somebody takes us when somebody that can only be seen as encouragement incitement\nTheir numbers surge beyond belief and the president has been trying over and over again he's been telling us he wants to make changes but the Democrats in Congress are blocking it and so are some Republicans\nA total of sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight family units these are ... nuclear families were caught between the point of entry in September a new record and he's sharp spike from the previous months into the one hundred sixty one thousand and I love and one hundred and Thirteen family units were apprehended\nThis year remember only one point four percent of the family units apprehended last year were deported so almost all of them remain in our communities along with the nearly half a million others who were never apprehended and this is growing every year so now we've gotten to almost seven hundred thousand\nAnd it goes on\nThis is an incredibly serious matter of course national sovereignty the rule of\nLaw or the nature of our immigration system it's being openly embrace suddenly violated and not just by aliens like people in our own country like people in our own country\nNow we spend a lot of time last night it's been picked up by a lot of news outlets a conservative news outlets since today as we have in the past on this issue pointing out the hypocrisy of the Democrats Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton Brock Obama\nBernie Sanders Chuck Schumer and many others Harry Reid\nThe positions that they took ten years ago Fifteen Years ago twenty five years ago the positions that they took on a legal immigration first of all they called them illegal immigrants\nAs recently as two thousand nine twenty ten Chuck Schumer called them illegal immigrants as a matter of fact he admonished his audience in two thousand nine he said look\nIf you don't use the word illegal\nThen you lose essentially the moral high ground what is this on documented stuff he said now of course he's reversed course 'cause they're all about power in politics not about country\nSo what's the point the point is the Democratic party is not even the Democrat Party of ten years ago\nIt's certainly not the Democratic party of Twenty years ago its position on immigration like its position on economics like its position in the military like its position on healthcare embraces increasingly radical\nPolicies in additives and it's not going to get any better it's going to get worse\nIf the media really want to understand the division in this country they need only look at themselves and look at the course of the Democratic party has taken you've a party where John Kennedy couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party where Bill Clinton couldn't be nominated for the presidency today\nYou have a party that wouldn't nominate Harry Truman for the presidency today and I could go down the list\nAnd so now you're individuals who won out radical each other\nTell me who is a centrist and the Democrat leadership voice so called moderate can you name one just name one\nWell I Can't name any I don't see 'em do you\nAll right by the way we have a wonderful guest at the bottom of the hour I told you each night now we'll have one or two candidates on here um there are many who are deserving of support and you know who they are but ah doesn't work that way on radio this can't be a ... a line of candidates\nLet's go to Billy Los Angeles California eight Seventy the answer K. R. L. A. go\nUm Israel van thank you very much for taking my call I just want to ah I I just want to add in my my low to censor I'll be real quick about this caravan I'm a cow\nOn a caravan of an invasion\nOf it is an invasion and and I don't know why I call it a caravan a it is an invasion and\nLos Angeles yesterday next thing you know they'll call it a parade anyway go ahead as\nA Los Angeles is becoming Tijuana they've just made this new law or anybody could sell anything on a on the sidewalk and if you drive around on the weekend through Los Angeles it looks like Tijuana and\nIsn't that nice pardon\nSo we're assimilating into Tijuana rather than the other way around\nYeah and I've had people at work saying well you should speak Spanish you should learn Spanish and I I I\nI but I don't want to learn Spanish why should I\nYeah and I you know I come from a very democratic family I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania where by family recall minors\nAnd uh the Democratic party really look out for the working class they don't anymore if the Democrats have completely gone so far left that they don't care about the the working class and in America anymore and you know the biggest thing that bugs me I Want the wall but I think the biggest thing that could be done is it's both sides it's it's\nIf if you really enforced e verify\nAnd you went to these people and he said okay every illegal alien that you hire or going to find you ten thousand dollars a week and and I think Trump was behind that and if I'm not mistaken that was brought up during this whole dreamer\nThing well give me another one why don't we enforce our visa rules forty five percent of the people here illegally comes to the front door and overstay their visas\nYeah exactly and it just really frustrating because I'm I'm a\nI'm I'm I'm a Republican in Los Angeles and I don't keep my mouth shut eye letter I'd let everybody know how I feel not not you know and and I usually do it in

limits by going out and voting out\nYou just said to me we need to set term limits and now you're telling me that people set the term limits I thought you meant from a constitutional ... we all know that people have the power to vote people in and out of office when we have term limits thanks for your call I and I can't stand it when we when I Can't communicate with somebody and have a

there's a race for the Senate Mississippi it's not talked about much outside of Mississippi and there's a gentleman running who I've always been a big fan of and his name is Chris McDaniel and he's running for the Senate and Mississippi how are you sir\nI Am great mark thank you for having me so\nWell it's my pleasure and explain to everybody in the nation as well as in Mississippi how this particular election works\nWell it's a special election you might recall that in twenty fourteen I rather just a forty one year income but by the name of Thad Cochran we're feeding Mr cook with the first night he came back out any scared forty thousand Democrats\nWith a Republican primary and they stole away from us at ... well I remember that\nYes there are just like yes Deborah's but does they then time a senator Cochran stepping down perfectly so they get Harold select the next senator from Mississippi were so happy to be a lifetime Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter by the name of the high risk so they appoint hurt the progression and now that means we're in a special race\nTriple the older reminder that term so for people in the race non harvest and that is no parties declared and what happens if the top to advance to a three week well after November\nBut the bottom line here mark here we are again I'd verse stabbed by conservative person at the same old machine and discover going to take 'em out\nWhy would the governor Brian I Believe his name is why would he appoints somebody who's been a lifelong Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton who are more recently became a Republican why would he point her to the Senate\nWell march I think this may surprise but gr listeners but Mitch McConnell doesn't like me very much\nAnd I don't like she'll very much either so within that\nMitch McConnell met with the governor\nYou have a structure to the governor were anyone but Mack Daniel\nSo sure enough they polled all the statewide against me and they didn't work out very well so they finally found this one person who didn't have much name id the thought process was despite the fact that she was a lifetime Democrat\nWaking up pointer we can write a whole bunch of money we can find her as a Republican even though she hasn't been seen may have a great chance to win so that's why it was Mitch McConnell hand selected or this person to be the appointee\nYou know I Know ah there's a lot of my conservative brothers and sisters out there who are now think the world of Mitch McConnell I Do not I think what he did in the case of Kevin was something that any Republican leader must do and should have done if they can't deliver\nA a Supreme Court position or when they control the majority in the Senate I don't care how small the majority is uh that would've sank the Republican Party for a decade in my view now having said that\nIt's actually more than that you were a constitutional conservative explain your views\nWell I'll go all the way back I was the state's lawyer against Obamacare I represented the lieutenant governor and ten other petitioners against Obamacare but here in my positions\nAre I guess outlay outline for you I I Believe strongly that the constitution I'm going to ritualized orientation I read your book men in black and understand the power of the court in the bottom line here is we've got to find people that can construed the document as originally intended\nAnd that means rejecting this a living constitution nonsense that's pushed by the likes of Kennedy and a Sotomayor and the like\nWe need to find more skill is more a Clarence Thomas's more individuals like Gorsuch that can stand they construe this document the way it was meant to be\nAnd what that means simply is the federal government it's way too large it's doing way too much article one section it gives an old our supposed to have all the other powers blow to the states and the people respectively so in every vote that way casting every speech could we get the idea that decentralized the power of the federal government\nAnd give those hours back to the people\nChris McDaniel tell us a tell us about your race in Mississippi how's it going\nIt's going very very well obviously the establishment\nOr they work hard to cut off our money supplies that's one of the big five but we always have when you stand up against the establishment when you push back\nThey punish conservative for doing that and yet we still have to have the courage and the guts to push back because they cannot be allowed to destroy this country the way they have over the last several years [noise] so what happens is they turn off our biggest of money and we have to find new ways to raise it and the five that despite that that will be outspent tend to one\nHis great at it my wife insists on it it's you know it's for cardiovascular and so and they're right\nThey pay me a lot healthier that's for sure I don't watch news when I exercise you know what I watch usually around ten am

S. C. or baseball or basketball or football or whatever the hell it is he knows it\n\nAnd even though I strongly disagree with Kalamazoo knee jerk liberalism\nI'm I'm I'm starting to like him more on that show although ah if they probably track who spoke the longest would be calendar typical lip typical lip\nTakes them five times as long as say what let that Steven ... insane about thirty second there really is\n\nHave you ever thought about the word education it means to lead for the word for it\nRaises another question which was for how do you know\nYou're going in the right direction now the easy answer the knee jerk answer is it just depends on which way you want to go now my friend and he has a dear friend", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "25"}
