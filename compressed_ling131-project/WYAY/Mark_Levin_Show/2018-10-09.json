they need us\nA lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according Erasmus and they came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit he hits back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you're not guilty judge Kavanaugh your an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup enemy only has stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world and it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and laws go spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push cabin off further and further and further cabin all kind of local looked over Trump and said that's my motto\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined other wimpy middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in them to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion because But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his ah all of his grades go girls' basketball coach in your teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine Ford she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy and hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he he in a sense hypnotic ... took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something air life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about their cost her phobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth well the she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses in every one ever witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapist notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when\nShe was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to write for\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the mid Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she flipped and change what she was saying in order to\nTry to take Kevin down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said that any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nLast

John please go ahead\nAnd show of following this thing pretty entirely from start to where it is now and uh absolutely I agree with your opening bottle first off factor stubborn thing you know and and the words of our of our\nOur our president you know John Adams a you know if you're just dissected and look strictly at ... and you go off the values of the country that you don't even guilty it's absolutely mind boggling how people can wait no kidding of course you know all this guy he's guilty\nJohn last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how unfair it was\nThat the president declared a innocent a bread isn't that what are you aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this was in a case but it just wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nMake kind of walk a Christina for down to perform rose path when she oddly questionnaire about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector tests and now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something in what she knew was that the ex boyfriend or Christina Ford and by the way Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend who sold his credit cards but I redress\n... what what the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend protecting a lie detector test\nOr the under oath through a sworn affidavit that boy friend Christina forward of Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend\nPreparing to take us governor administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically everything\nThat Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed\nWhether it's the front door the fear of flying not taken airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector tests\nAnd she did kill somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford a lot about the little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nOh without a doubt I mean that that that is\nThe only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting that kind of a tactic is actually allow\nThat that's that's terrified because you're now take somebody from a lesser degree or a lesser income in life or whatever the case may be a you know so that they're just they're all coming back or something like that there could be no coming back\nWhether whether you know just the fear factor and it could be absolutely false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life as\nWell when John orders front Kevin all go to get back his reputation if you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know when it happened I didn't know how it happened and the foreign witnesses she possessed supplied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty of that and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight on [laughter] that would that would be a hell of a road and wouldn't come back you know uh but then again I wouldn't get their due process went at it from such\nA thing and you know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney\nI've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what uh uh someone stole my Chevrolet\nI'm not going to crush the new to say wanted someone still for no it was a Chevrolet if so if you go in and say my left foot turning I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault ten to twenty percent of the time\nThere are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho are wrongfully convicted of sexual assault Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry uh two black guys spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was a hub through university case were for\nCollege man that ... chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow student came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples\nHow a woman or man falsely accused as someone of a sexual assault\nFor all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look or in the eye which the Senate denied\nAnd now that we took ... know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media tore apart the story after seeing afford improve that she was either a ... or a lawyer or both\nAnd they could prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact innocent and not even president\nAnd so when this has happened is that going to stop the radical left now from perpetrating allies against Brett Kavanaugh the answer is not just know the answers hell no they're going to continue\nA tactical long ago this this is what they do that and that's the part that just\nSubpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slug Jerry ... are taking over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nIt would be terrible I mean it\nMay well I mean what legislation would pass what what

Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are in charge of the house of representatives what positive things would ever go on\nNothing that I could think of\nIran even if we got a mute Mueller out of the picture oh jeez they would\nThey would just keeps the painting and keep investigating investigating and it would be nonstop investigations that when the house so we ...
