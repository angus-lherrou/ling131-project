they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz so it is the consider the source thing but I I Want it\nThere is some points here this is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron disadvantage for governor for years after endorsing Democrat right\nThe lights are from the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago before the baby I endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways they love people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently who's a Democrat but as a serving out of the saint Pete area but uh anyway what's the last time he actually it was a Republican governor in in Florida Rubio ran him\nOut of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing and Wednesdays endorsement of dissent is the PBA president said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies quote\nThe men and women of law enforcement want to tell for the ... ... said this has our backs that is why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the Florida PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years some of their quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians whichever resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boils boils here but the be whatever you want to refer to this\nPose or that pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for the sons and all he ended the article with this\nHe didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nCall myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mother's a their children in the car\nBut you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over and part of what may need so upset I notice what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look in in I was tracking violence towards police officers remember\nBefore the whole Kaepernick thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country\nAnd I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida that tracks the violence against police officers and here you have someone posing as a journalist\nWho has the audacity to say he didn't offer examples have ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you\nYou might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative the advance\nBut here's what's real in this story\nRemember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing round is saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here\nSince twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three\nSince they last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed\nThree forty killed and until this week\nWe had and and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and forget about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers died line duty afforded than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nWhen he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups by media by politicians\nAnd it's exactly why I started a series that I did a couple of years ago\nAnd in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now been put in that position yeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop get ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a bad apple\nBut almost every one of all good people to put their lives on the line every single day for us and it is our responsibility now more than ever to back the badge and spread the word\nIs not getting better and worse we have this kind of crap that's going on and media if we don't want to have good folks don't want to be police officers that put on the badge to leave their families and by the way just this year\nWe had Seventy widows Seventy widows Seventy people that have lost their spouse\nAnd the line of duty we've had more than a hundred children that have lost a parent\nIn the line of duty stories are never told\nBut if we don't have great folks to pick up that badge to put it on the field that helped hold that fill that void the rest of the matter\nAnd
