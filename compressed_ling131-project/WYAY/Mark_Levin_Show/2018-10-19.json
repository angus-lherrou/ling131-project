three eight one thirty eight eleven and I want to go back to Barbara Barbara go ahead with your point\nThen this is my passion for Twenty years and I've written on it and I ran for office on it and multiple things but I studied it for three years down here I live in Houston I bet a victim of a six years ago there are thousands of cases that are ... that don't even make it to the book\nWhere I had one call in my house that night then hand and almost killed me that aren't even making it to the court system I beg\nPresident Trump to listen to all of tax and that they are they are pouring over

south side of our tickets to the Trump rally Monday Night they moved the venue some energy to Toyotas center you cannot imagine how palm Texans are where oh they're they're they're\nSo thrilled about

working together um you also have a a great working relationship between the two on Capitol Hill or are they have a very good relationship the vice president and Ted Cruz and and even Donald Trump junior\nHas come down and help and helped out Ted Cruz as well and I think what you're going to see on Monday Night is getting the people in Texas fired up to beat a this candidate that wants to open borders and says vote for me and all impeached Donald Trump which is not how this country's laws work\nWell and he wants to wants to take our gun you don't take our guns in fact this nine out of ten people carry yes only carry you don't come here and\nSay you're going to take her guns I cricket ban that it it's got to be a landslide victory across\nI Hope you're right but I'm I I Am cautious about it because I think that we were in trouble or just from not paying attention\nOr people feel secure in and I I tried to explain this the other day on TV I said the reason why Democrats are doing well is because there is mad as we were when Obama was in office at the end right and so they're furious there to fever pitch\nA lot of people if you got if you feel like things are under control and Donald trumps the president and you feel good about it and you feel like you're doing a good job and doing the right thing and wives getting good and you can enjoy life you're not as focused because you're not married you're not frustrated\nI Believe that Ted Cruz was in serious trouble from just lack of a of enthusiasm because people feel secure it they were comfortable and how things are going in Texas how things were going in Washington with Donald Trump being the president and now\nUh because of the character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh because Democrats have already said they're campaigning on you give us the control the house for the Senate we will impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump is re engage the base and fire them up\nAnd that's why you're going to see the thing

media and the Democrats and some Republicans are reacting to this story of this a\nColumnist for the Washington Post who apparently was killed\nOr by officials with the Saudi Government the way they're all ... that has everything to do with the mid term elections the caravan as they're calling it\nOf thousands of Hondurans Salvadorans Guatemalans waving their flags and marching across Mexico to illegally cross our border and stay here in this country because they believe they deserve to be here\nAnd we can't do anything about it that has everything to do with the mid term elections\nAnd I in ... king Castro's non denial denial via Twitter he revealed something that you need to understand because this is the next two years of our lives if the Democrats when\nHe said it's\nBeing

story develops um [noise]\nBut it's all everything that is in the news right now\nHas to do with the midterm elections we're going to talk about this crisis at our border coming up in a bit actually interviewed a [noise]\nA democratic senator from Maryland Ben Carson about this issue and I'm going to play some of that in her ... you for you because you have to hear how Democrats are talking about this thing they will not answer questions it's a very simple question\nOkay you want to be a senator you want to be a Congress men you are currently and you're running for reelection here's my question what do you do\nWith these thousands and thousands\nFrom foreign nations storming our border demanding entry where we really need to do better economic development in those countries so that they have better conditions and they do that\nNo that's okay too late for that what do you do today what do you do right now on our border\nWell we need to increase the border security is what we know you made a wall no no no no no no we don't want to wall but we need to increase border security so that we can do with the\nOkay so you want to spend billions of dollars on more border control what are they going to do because your policies up until now is if somebody crosses our border and says I Want asylum then you hand them a slip of paper that says okay well see in a couple of months for your hearing how bad it\nIs do we still do or do you turn them around and send them home do not let them in do you arrest them for breaking our our laws\nDo you detained them at the border and if you do do you keep them as a family unit while they're detained what did they don't want to all they want to do is criticize all they want to do is throw slogans around but no one's willing to step up and say the very real truth of what we need to do\nBuild a wall protect our border enforce our laws as they are written\nAnd stop with this idea that there is a right to migrate to our country because there isn't let's go to a\nChief in Titusville, Pennsylvania Keith your next step on the market live in show\nHigh I was wondering what you thought about Trump announcing to his department heads he'd like them to cut five percent across the board I Wonder how much money that will say the U.S taxpayer and why no one's talking about it\nDo you think Republicans should be a a touting that they should say look you keep us empower we're going to help the president reduce the budget across the board\nOh absolutely and not only that as we should be eliminating multiple federal departments [noise]\nThere's a lot of state departments that are doing the same thing that the federal departments are doing everything has a department of education department of agriculture and the waste that the federal level is incredible and no one's talking about downsizing the federal government and reducing the cost to operate the federal government\nAnd he announced that the other day and it's getting no play and I just like to know why\nThanks skates well it is not getting a lot of play because of all the way in terms of the news coverage is because the news focuses on what they choose to focus about all of the great news and the economy or with regard to jobs with regard to Wall Street with regard to profits with regard to manufacturing they're not paying any attention to that either\nA key thank you for the call and and the other beauty or of of what the president has done here is that he is bypassing Congress lives in Congress\nCan set the law they can set their budget they can appropriate funding but the executive branch actually does uh do vis spending right they do the hiring they do the actual operation of these federal agencies just because Congress appropriate the money that's not incumbent on the executive branch to actually spend that money\nAre now the problem is Congress can't go back to their voters and say hey we've reduced the federal budget we've reduced the federal\nAnd what happens then\nAs soon as they cross the border and there are stopped by border patrol and they say oh I Want asylum you know what happens then\nWhy get into what I play a
