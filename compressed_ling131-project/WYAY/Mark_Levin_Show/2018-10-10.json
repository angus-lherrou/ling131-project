{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WYAY", "content": "Well I'll leave you with some good news or play I I was not a Trump fan okay I was a pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president\nAnd I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nThat's why I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning because I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati\nOn friday I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles as Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say doesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president\nI think is an Iowa denied he hopefully it will be out everyday between now and election day and when he comes to town that and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up those guys the messiah a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz would have done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma\nDoesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty over for or Whitney Houston circa twenty oh three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to ride that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruise in there but my eyes were opened and here's what my eyes are open to that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump as a president\nOr not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald did know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that have confidence bay and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis kind of get back to where it

camps hurricane Michael is grown in that category three storm and is expected to pack a wall up when it makes landfall on the Florida Panhandle meteorologist Tom said her since the storm surge to be life threatening\nThe surge from Panama City the Appalachian coal could be as high as nine feet we've got eight to twelve feet over toward the swan a river this is the time of year where the ties are the highest they're called the king tides and they keep that of course in their uh thinking when they put out these warnings\nHurricane Michael is traveling across the Gulf of Mexico at twelve miles an hour and the trumps protected path such as all the way to New Jersey and search is underway to find a new U.S ambassador to the United nations after Nikki Haley announced he would step down at the end of the year Republican congressman Mark Sanford in South Carolina says the timing of the announcement is interesting if it\nHard to prove this a hate crime they wouldn't be hard to prove they hate us\nIt's not going to happen in Oregon I guess but what about the U.S department of justice doing it what about Jeff Sessions in the FBI and all the rest of what about that\n[noise] I agree that's where it should come from the top because you know in Charlottesville will not ...\nAnd the white skin ad ran into a crowd and killed some woman he was charged with a murder in Virginia then he was charged with a hate crime now I don't know why it's a crime if a white person kills a white person but nonetheless I went back to spend the rest of his life in jail because he killed in it as a woman who was protesting I'm with them\nAnd when and when when white supremacist march or on Charlottesville yelling about Jews you're talking to a guy this practice law would Jews most of my professional life I'm disgusted by that\nAre running around Charlottesville at night with tiki torches talking about the N word and about Jews that's bad stuff that happens but ten times that stuff\nHappens on the left all the time and it's never confronted in reality from what it is which is hate from the left\nThere's much more hate from the left and from the right there's many more hate crimes on the left and on the right but they're never prosecuted that why are they\nNow know they're not\nWell same we gotta go thanks for your call this move on to John and California John and California Welcome to the mark Levin show John please go ahead\nI Wanna ask you a great legal mind a question from the school to get drafted by over their control in the streets in Oregon\nAnd the mayor's ordering them to the police to stand down so that people can be assaulted their property can be destroyed the mayor be charged for aiding and abetting um those who against\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with one state authorities act or under act on their color if state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon is part of an unspoken conspiracy the object to which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals' confronted Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property and then when authorities did not arrest those individuals\nThis happen in Washington DC\nThis was under color a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted in such a way so as to deny the human rights\nTed Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice under Jeff Sessions\nThese things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color upstate law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy John\nIs that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine large numbers of radical individuals taking over as intersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking white citizens'\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and say not in my city and there's tape on Fox tonight of Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything to happen this is despicable and this is wrong it can happen in America\nIs lying is political gender to go for it or you didn't even expect the governor to step up and say I'm going to bring up the national guard I'm gonna take my state back I'm gonna take my city back I'm not going to tolerate this maybe somebody above it needs to step in the federal government but we can't have America like that they have to do all this violence\nWhat what I think the mere Portland believes what he's doing is politically popular he's doing what the citizens of Portland want him to do and elected him to do it and so how is it possible that a great American city not in the south but Portland, Oregon\nAllows in ... to take over city streets block intersections line in front of federal buildings making an impossible for federal agents to do their job\nAnd the mayor of Portland a clown effect was full name wheeler does absolutely nothing to stop it because politically it's popular to do that in Portland, Oregon\nYou know John how is that possible how do we get ourselves in this situation the incivility on the left his unspeakable\nLeft the state says a leftist movement that's all they are saying thank you for your a great job current and for the great one\nJohn thank you and when I watch what happened on the Supreme Court on Thursday Friday Saturday and even today on Brett Kavanaugh's first day on the job large numbers of individuals in violation of federal law committed criminal trespass on federal property\nAnd I'll watch them climbing on top of an statues and scratching up the doors of the United States Supreme court how\nHow do they do this in public committed ... literally thousands of crimes in public a few are arrested there find like fifty dollars on the first violation and then the second time they might be a night in jail and the guy paying it as George Soros\nHow's it possible this massive lawlessness and it's occurring without recompense

eight\nEncourage violent protests cities were burned on a democratic marriage there would be there would be a hundred killed millions of dollars a property destroyed all hell breaks loose\nAnd average Americans look too bad and said we do one hundred sixty eight or take Nixon or promises law and order four years later the chaos continued cities continue to burn administration building taken over in college campuses murder was rampant and what happened in Nineteen Seventy two Nixon\nOne forty nine out of fifty states because average Americans live in Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Ohio Kentucky Indiana Texas Florida\nCouldn't look I didn't like what they were seeing on TV and had a candidate promising law and order and uh we're working on behalf of the moral majority in the silent majority and that current candidate is the president Donald Trump he's doing what Nixon did in sixty eight and Seventy two\nSo and Hillary Clinton playing the part of you were a chump free says the rules of civility or suspended because Republicans control the Congress and once the Democrats take over then the rules of civility we'll be imposed once again\nIt is a blatantly stupid comment\nTwenty eight per by a margin of twenty eight percentage points independent voters believe the Democrats actor like fools or the Kevin all committee hearings by a margin of twenty eight percent a great number see Hillary's doing this now she's Seventy Seventy one years old\nAnd she wants to appear hip and radical\nBut at say ... it's not true it doesn't work she used to say during the campaign I'm with you\nKnow Hillary as saying I'm with them the ... demonstrators that black lives matter protesters who demand the murder of cops what do we want that cops wondering want them now that black lives matter protesters at say pigs in a blanket prime like bacon\nThat's what is encourage the Democratic party and the last couple of years of the Obama administration as black radicals and white apologist all over the country\nScream for the murder of cops and it happened in Dallas and Baton Rouge and all over the country\nYou might recall that brought Hussein Obama into the White House took the founders of representatives del Rey because there's a black lives matter\nIs if they had a point to make the cops are racist murderers systemically which is not the case every now and then you have all the corn McDonald situation in Chicago where a cop should not a shot that boys sixteen times\nEvery now and then you have something bad happened the want to point one one percent out of Ninety nine point nine percent when cops do water right\nBut the argument is not that the occasional cop occasionally does something wrong the argument for the Democratic party is the cops are an occupying force there not worthy of being protected and loved you not worthy of our support not worthy of law and order and so when a candidate like Trump promises law and order\nThe silent majority will arise and stop the Democratic party once again to overplay its hand\nAnd we Kevin ... and I don't know if the fire can be maintained another twenty eight days twenty eight days from tonight\nWe're going to have the results of most of the most of the elections by by midnight tonight we're going to know twenty eight days from now and I'm willing to strongly predict that the United States Senate will stay within the grasp of the Republican Party because of the behavior of Democrats\nPlay overplay their hand and it's way too much so it's continuous morals go to Craig and little falls Minnesota Craig in Minnesota Welcome to the mark Levin show bill accounting him here incorrect please go ahead\nYeah good to hear you on night other than Sunday I'm I'm a concern that if there is a red wave which I think there's gonna be I'm concerned that these antifa types are going to just go absolutely bonkers everywhere\nMaybe start shooting more Republican\nWell see that's the problem when somebody comes up to my car with a mask on tries to drag me out of it I've got a glock forty three that I'm licensed to carry in about forty four states and I think somebody with a mask is going to meet up with that and and and\nThey're actually putting me in jeopardy and they're putting a lot of other people in jeopardy I don't know how to I don't know how how we deal with that but\nEspecially these places where there's Democrats in charge and they're going to encourage it just like they're doing in Portland\nWhat Craig I Would imagine Portland, Oregon I also have a concealed carry permit I Would imagine Oregon doesn't have reciprocity was hardly anybody and you can imagine if you're in Minnesota in Ohio and Kentucky and Alabama and Texas and Florida there aren't too many moms pulling people out of pickup trucks because that ain't gonna work\nMaybe in Portland it works and what is so despicable the video tonight on Fox there is a Portland police officer in uniform on a motorcycle watching these individuals shutdown intersections in downtown Portland and doing nothing about it\nCrazy that's crazy and I don't know how the cops feel about it I suppose there are a beat up and they want to keep their jobs so they do with the boss tells them or or maybe they're complicit with it I don't know what\nTed we're now I you know I think cops are the greatest people ... to me like soldiers and I have great respect for police\nBut they're hired by the city of Portland and mayor Ted Wheeler is the political mayor of Portland, Oregon and he allows this activity to happen\nHow about for a month

probably justice Kavanaugh or is a mark within my ...\nAbout the remarkable historic victory of the Republican Party in maintaining majorities in the house and the Senate\nWhich story what we hear for weeks from tonight\nIt really depends on you and it depends on what you were willing to do because right now I have seen Republican voters\nIn my town of Washington D. C. and yes there are Republicans in Washington and then the greater Washington area but all across this country I assume Republicans motivated an energized and ready to walk across broken glass to get to the ballot box and that's important but it's not everything\nThe only way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen\nIs because people not just voted but they told their friends to vote they told their family members to vote they made sure that they became part of the message and they said we can't let her when\nWe can't let her pick Supreme Court justices we can't let her be the commander in chief look at who she is look at what she thinks of us look at her history\nThat's what happened two years ago next month\nThat's how you win elections when you're up against the mainstream media when you're up against Hollywood when you're up against television and music and the universities and the news media that's how you when you have to tell your friends and your family we can't let this happen so are you ready now\nAre you ready because they just showed you over the weekend and over the past two weeks how they're going to govern the Democrats want all of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nThey want to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years what are you willing to do to stop it\nEight seven seven three one\nThree eight one one it started yesterday on CNN well actually forgive me it started\nEarly in the morning yesterday in the Washington Post these things happen and they're all coordinated have you noticed that\nThe Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as the mob\nTalking about how this is a dog whistle\nHow the mob isn't really a mob\nAnd then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast is never Trump ... republic I was about calm Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read at the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens\nWhen you go from being a Republican to a non Republican you switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast and but he's a good guy and I have no match for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin\nMary Catherine ... friend of mine also an never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federal is she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Capitol hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left\nThe things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and happened over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nDo you remember the mob is on the campuses have UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech in a little mild mannered been Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involved marshmallows in small cars\n\nIn the moral words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word ... totally ... it is without\nA doubt that there's no other word is ... put a stop what ... what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that delightful she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often delivery you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I mind with Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a Stewart Bernie and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her rejoined her she had her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob\nWhich was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\n[noise] uh but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left\nOr my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host he uh he pointed out that uh they always report these that's mostly peaceful\nIn the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protests this described is mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests abducted ended up in the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful\nThat was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continues\nOn what we saw chasing right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or is that a lot I think it's easily along\nYeah and if there are the party as we call it um out for sure come on like this area\nYeah so that's Mary Landrieu ... jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual Brooklyn actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was gonna get pushed back she didn't have another originally under the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville sign of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that are real fast Richard\nLennie Lennie Lennie will pass the N. word because I feel like that as part of the weaponization of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he ... he now says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word\nAgainst Democrats against the law you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying the word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally\nWhere he first raised this issue and uh and and she's probably right in the sense\nThe word is being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today\nAnd it's being weaponized in such a way that it is ... devastatingly effective\nAgainst the Democrats that's why CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why the next thing we know Facebook will start at silencing you if you take your own social media and start calling\nA mob mob\nIt's correct and it's working\nAnd send the southeastern Alabama

Phil basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have one\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty and saying well he couldn't even run the government\nRight that's what they're trying to do\nPresident Trump nominated Jeffrey ...
