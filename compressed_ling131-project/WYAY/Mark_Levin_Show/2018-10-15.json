development in the case of a missing Washington Post columnist correspondent Clarissa war\nSaudi Arabia is preparing a report in which they will acknowledge\nThat Jim ... she was killed in the Saudi conflicts that it was not intentional that it was the result of essentially a botched operation\nA a a botched interrogation that was likely supposed to end up in a in a kidnapping or abductions are taken from turkey presumably back to Saudi Arabia\nOh they hadn't been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner what Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely\nIt is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative in trying to advance he re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is eight eight\nTrump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people\nThe moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost total logical Trump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames it Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listening she's not them she's very bright she's just the liberal is liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop them she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted and four times but we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the way basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all\nThat's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tests the talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talked period and the story right\nSo the takeaways here\nFor anybody thinking about it or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance Trump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media pace this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nThe benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last then that's what everybody remembers\nSold tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie and then that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of again\nA battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits he hits hard that people are attracted to that authenticity\n\nSo we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but the show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democrat Party right now which is a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic\nWho they are they based their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\n... ... I mean who\nWhat other president other than Donald Trump will never forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement\nCould have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lives by driving them when Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic\nElizabeth Warren will not let this go ... go places

they don't want your money they want the whole economy and they try to frame it in this call you guys have rich people the rich people are getting over they're not paying their fair share really because I saw a fascinating piece today I got a lot to cover today\nThat's a fascinating piece in Bloomberg of all I'm not a big huge fan of the Web but once in a while they have good articles in economics and Bloomberg of all places talking about the actual percentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers are going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\n... let me just say something numbers so much it's the comparisons\nYou'll see what I mean I'm In the top one\nPercent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners pay an astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country\nThink about that one out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in this country\nChew on that one for a minute you may say okay well\nYou know that one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich\nFolks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent view liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff pays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nTo pick up about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... you're not that rich you don't pay your fair share of the ... thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you know pay your Fisher it's not that Trump just doesn't accept that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts\nOver with a you know what they pay a lot they actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] good job the top one\nPercent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load than the\nBottom Ninety what the hell's a fair share of that is not is you hear what I'm ...\nThere's more of a isn't just that there's more of these comparisons into this isn't a Bloomberg peace again not or some right wing website here\nI mean his son and a negative way but I'm sure as liberal listening it'd be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact this is from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent of the income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy is it is so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors vote in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes would have we had Al Sharpton at his tax debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example we buy the example if you believe in what you're saying\nSo there's no hypocrisy here for Republicans we think taxes sock\nBecause we think outside of our military and our courts you flush the money down the toilet bowl you don't know anything about the economy and you waste it which you prove us right all the time\nWe would rather donate it to charity and let the free marketing and charities handle it who can actually help people locally but no you suck up all our money you get a big tidy ball flush and you flush it down to ... and I'm Glad we got a president who doesn't accept this premise that all\nThey usually the best is
