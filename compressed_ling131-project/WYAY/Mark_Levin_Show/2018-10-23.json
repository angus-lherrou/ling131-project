to tell you I was out there early voting out that a rally with Governor Abbott twice what it often want to San Antonio he's obviously now gone down to Houston with a ... than it was Senator Cruz\nIt's been a great day uh we've been all over the district people are fired up but I tell you early voting numbers are really really really high they've smashed all record on I think an area that indicate that on both sides of the of the aisle if you will so we've got to do our part to get the vote turned out because if we turned out we ...\n[noise] yeah early voting in Texas has started as with other states and ladies and gentlemen if you hear me right now really don't put this off get out there and voter and you know what the early voting was set up by the left to try and a and a change this\nSome you can take advantage of it to go ahead and vote early and the more uh people who do that the better now tell us how your race looks in your district\nWell uh you know it mirrors in many ways senator Cruz's raise a and it is they ah\nYou know tight and and and and hard fought but very winnable race or with the support of your listeners a lot of good taxes we feel good but we feel that it's necessary for everybody to show up in order for us to when my opponent as I think you know\nIs a a a very liberal Democrat very liberal\nWho served in the United States Army and I think of her service but he uses that to try to claim centrism to claim independent that he's running in his dad but there is nothing centrists and nothing independent about somebody who was already said he would vote to impeach Donald Trump\nWho's already said that he would undo the tax cuts\nIt was already said that he would put in place that carbon tax is already said that he wants to regulate guns he wants single payer government run health care called Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give them the other country\nAnd I can go down a long list but he is trying to run a defectors then he's not\nBut I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they are seeing through Mr O'Rourke a efforts to a claim centrism and if that set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\nAnd a lot of these leftists in Texas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't that\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much are worth seeing that both with congressmen award as well as my opponent and others uh the Democrats very purposely without recruited leftists\nWho could run because they may have worn a uniform or otherwise good a wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because they know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something market I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my opponent he never has a response\nWhy would my opponent or why would better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or set in her to do all of the socialist things where at least it's constitutionally reasonable that have the debate but they know that stuff doesn't sell in Texas so the only way to win the only way\nTo go team up when they had people over the Chuck Schumer and the rest of the left this to the coast or trying to buy off Texas with thirty eight million dollars of money and that ain't gonna work they're not going to buy Texas because taxes are going to stand up on the wall\nCharge [laughter] not sure how ... is this all [laughter]\nI\nFigured

of ours\nNews reporter this is the White House correspondent the senior White House correspondent for ABC News good morning America\nGo ahead\nAnd the White House to help Republicans an edge in terms of that strategy is stoking fears about immigration\nThere you go this is also an attack\nOn New Year's eve because you're so stupid that the president is able to cause you to be fearful and scared\nYou're so stupid you can't process what's actually taking place\nAnd besides it totally zero point zero six percent of all undocumented people already in this country and the irony is that

which of course the media never talk about\nInstead of talking about the economy which the media could care less about the president is stoking he's a he's leaning into his message of fear not law and

about motivating you because you see ladies and gentleman unless you are absolutely\nEmotionally out of your mind you're not going\nTo hope you're not going to vote\nAnd yet is not immigration a key issue is not an important issue it may not be an important issue to phony journalists to phony anchors the phony hosta phony reporters but it is an important issue to men and women who\nGo to work every day try to raise their families and live in communities that are exposed to this it is the people who break their ass everyday paying their property taxes and in some states where we have income taxes most states and so much of that money goes to individuals who are here illegally\n\nIt matters to people who are construction workers it matters to people who are truck drivers in taxi drivers it matters that people who work with their hands many people who work with their hands none of these reporters work with their hands at least not above the table\n\nGo ahead Democrats from winning back the house or the Senate or voters obviously what's crucial that circumstance here is that the president recognizes that he is up against the wall right here this is a reporter\n\nNow Gloria
