the headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC how Taylor Swiss political adores men could become the biggest red\nAt the polls for ever as the polls [laughter] I mean\nOK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's an actor\nLast way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking her stance a political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nBe effective Swiss surprise endorsement which was mainly on Instagram post were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media recently has a couple of days ago or ... oh my gosh it's happening I think it's quite a down a little bit over the past the hour or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey are you so he was up in Tennessee or\nI'm Taylor ... specific endorsement of the Democrat so Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's average in a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee right Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race early this now nine points\nSo\nOh not exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighed in on\nIs negative six percent in a week to like to say you got two sides histories and one side the facts but here's\nThe deal you got a lot of folks there if you play the millionaire the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction rent or science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in\nAnd specifically when she ended up outing herself pretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing seat if you're in Tennessee\nAnd you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrite for a few reasons\nAmong others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her Tennessee values but you see here is that the the dirty little details Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania huh and she happened\nOnly moved to a tendency to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know him the you know Taylor Swift as to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas smelling\nNow she spoke up supporting elegy BP arrives\nGDP rights as far from Tennessee thought he was by the white\n[noise] guess what the Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton said he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go\nAnd then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in in Nashville that are\nYeah but here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who does not support\nGay marriage and the host of other elegy Beatty rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\n[laughter] I mean and there's a lot more we we can continue\nDown that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those in Tennessee they pretty much get the point to and Yale Law yule log\nIn terms of tendency values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't as a painting I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm either way it wasn't that an awkward moment I mean I did the trick always does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at a win celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kinda miss her moment you see if she actually wanted somebody\nWith her Pennsylvania tendency\nElegy Beatty writes values she couldn't actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that\nSome Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOberlin praised endorsement really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for ... over Hillary Clinton so\nIt's only Taylor Swift headway then whether Pennsylvania algae B. T. tendency values maybe she wouldn't have ended up with an old white guy who doesn't support gay marriage or the algae\nThe leader of one of the search crews comprise the forties men and women told

you want to be part of that by the way it's oh I'm Sorry oh let's go to Joe in Jersey Joe go\nHey Brian how are you oh good for\nA while I was waiting for you I just thought of something an extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um this this Taylor Swift thing could be\nEven a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being any body of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on the night of nine eleven you remember they had that music visual of ... a vigil with Springsteen and Tom Petty where they were pounding the war drums you recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we walked back down um it was all a it was all of a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at you but they're the same they all come from the same cost especially Springsteen were they were anti war\nA it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken a serious anymore\nI can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where the celebrities do if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talked about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's\nRight well it the first thing is you got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody has closed minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most as offensive thing and I say this yeah I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen that kinda thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency values\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania\n[laughter] name they drew many of the folks in Tennessee that those people and so it's kinda like I Know if I see you in in in Jersey joke but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey\nNot not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost at the center of the state\nUm for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know more conservative area but I I just hope hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is an irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just ah\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really you you got some work to do with Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota hailing\nOh I'm a liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and honestly with the tenth and sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nA very quickly I didn't vote for

B. S. that MPs is somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap nobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic we believe in due process at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nButter Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\nKicked him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident ... offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no\nIs the ah the event does your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or\nA bunch of other incidents that have arisen the past several months of the Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event how can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him insane or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen how is that possible\nBut it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs his own speed dial with coach dinner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media\nWho thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia\nIs the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weak in Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they\nBecome sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran they're the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding\nFriendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight\nYou may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars\nA of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis countries do these kinds of things if Saudi

now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat ah it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine percent never get U.S Supreme court and so if\nIn twenty days the Senate flip through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point if Trump was reelected which most of us believe he will\nDo this and that stays democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one and it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop they will not nominate a you could nominate but they will not confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system\nAnd whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the middle\nSecondly all the investigations\nThat the house of becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely the investigations of every aspect of Trump's live\nHis wife's life Jared Kushner's live everyone's life in the White House will be laid bare and the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot\nRun off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens it's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect of course is foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with his odds things are pretty good\nNorth Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by\nThe Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria foreign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy according to some national international experts the American economy right now it's\nThe greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus she got the impeachment issue is there any down your mind that the Democrats who went to eliminate Trump from office so if you went to the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about a and only about investigations and impeachment and hurt the economy and that's what's on the ballot so when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on if that happens\nDo they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies and procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivized says they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize interview incentivize the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your

the league that they had conversations\nWith authority ... and his entourage around a range the kitten that doesn't guy though and if you look at recently I'm John Brennan the last past two days and then and they say he confirmed that through his CIA operative so I think\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point and\nOh don't do on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS why\nWhy do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian

L. M. got what they want and what are we went dead cops when even when I'm now in ... were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Alice was murdered in a barge down Kentucky ambush killing\nWe don't know who did it and at this point\nWhat is in the media spend time instead of a ... show geek in Turkey take up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform\nAnd spent time as those who killed him and why was murdered re most who was killed according to this black nationalist\nHe said that he wanted to come and killed police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown and Eric Garner and so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not do Michael Brown tried to kill\nA police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt by Obama's Justice Department than Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events there was a sick mind in Baltimore who thought police officers short fold because of the way CNN covered the killing of Michael Brown who was an unarmed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson\nAnd grab his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven but the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist the hunt down ...

until then it's always a kick always a pleasure to have on the president of United States Donald J drop I've interviewed him many times over the years\nNormally when it was telling a book or doing a business deal\nAnd we've established a bit of a friendship I'm happy to defend that great man and ABC News George Stephanopoulos or on CNN\nI have a lot of feeling for the president or forty five Donald J dropping\nA Mr President before we get too deep into there's no money is playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about ... trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live\nAnd she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and there was quite something special\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you are going to continue\nTo give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico and South Korea\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deals probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right up in South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was\nFor us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nSo we're not as many jobs you're talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually I'll be talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country and the European Union has been\nBrutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions that come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send the piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and and he said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nWe've dealt China where five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've built Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's gonna come back to America\nFrom stock market losses while helping you achieve a reasonable rate of return to give us a call for all for eight nine zero five six zero six or
