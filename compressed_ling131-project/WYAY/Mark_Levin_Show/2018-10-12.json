know\nBut a lot of times people will go you know how is it that this friend I've had over a year turned around and stab me in the back\nWell that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics whether you might disagree with and just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage but moral outrage by the media on back of ... I mean President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality words\nUnless you're potentially responded Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno ... so maybe you know as long as you're not the the sponsors say no or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo still wants to say that one is evil ten is perfection we're all Tuesday nights and if it were ... were really having a good day and where our best versions of our son\nWe're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that mean well it means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you start out and unless sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life\nBut when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your rights were sports you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit\nSo many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nThat you have people that defend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than I have an idea I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place them around to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view things through the prism that you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about you wins climate science and went frauds they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial for on the conversation\nThe reality it's fraud bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity\nI'll get around and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for and I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd see I Believe should ultimately be tried for it now I had somebody said well her witnesses the ones that ended up refuting her claims maybe maybe\nThey were the ones who weren't being honest and this was her said there may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can committed felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as you're reasons are good enough\nIf a sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about this sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you getting me Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media\nThat sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West in the oval office\nThat is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know\nWhere your moral compass happens to be\nOr you five or six or seven and eight where are you where when you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they where they\nAre they six is not a good day in threes on a bad day\nYou know last week I was talking a bit about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people of things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open to information the first place and the problem is you don't have a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there were only seven percent of folks top to bottom ... ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent through everything that's it\nSo you've got to find people that are open minded and open to information as a pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be stabbed in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself an add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because anymore\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including by a former attorney general who happens to now be saying well go ahead and kick the opposition that's the world we now live and\nSo ... and well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years remember the last time we were talking about Kanye West and the president\nThat was a little bit of a different story and over the past Thirteen Years a few things have changed and ... who is working right now and a few things about the economy and that's where

Bush was racist\nNo [laughter] I said go\nDuring the country and the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was mesmerized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that entire thing was taking place yes [laughter]\nIf I actually went back in and watched a little while uh the the little series there are earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was the culmination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time\nHe's looking he'll look at gone yet you look at the teleprompter ill or get gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts\n[laughter] but yeah\nIt is bad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers picks up it starts reading the dumpster\nAnd all the time moment anyway no I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to introduce policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success unique and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do\nYou have to prove to them that you can make a difference\nAnd as we're talking about record ... minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community that's a Donald Trump story she can sit there and\nCan say Donald Trump is is a racist Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for and the economy that has more black adults now worked in ...\nBefore it has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare it's providing a path in an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you how to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing\nNever forget I've lived many lives even though I'm I'm not all that old I pack a lot into a given day [laughter]\n[noise] it's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know I keep going be [noise] I I um I had to move the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh end up getting a call and call came from government office during a unemployment verification jak verify the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike okay so I end up going over to the employee and conversation takes place and I could tell\nAfter a couple of minutes that it was ... she was getting upset she was getting really upset\nIt was like OK gets off the phone as she tells me you know what to do just happen Senate making too much money\nSingle mother she's a single mother and she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey weren't actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took ... catalysts that are again James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good in the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment than\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well of course open change when there was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at them\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keep an economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need them okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nAnd what do you see\nYou see somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue was not a Republican\nItaly's not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man because he did what couldn't be done\nHe made a difference in acting policy they gave people a chance and that means that you create open minds that means that when you hear that wow Donald Trump's approval rating among black adults is in double digits all the sudden\nA lot of bang fantasize try\nTry to Shannon broke and I know all about ever dry I Know that the
