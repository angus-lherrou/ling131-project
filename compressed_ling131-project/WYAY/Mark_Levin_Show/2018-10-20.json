filmmakers look at movies they don't look at movies the same way you when I look at movies because they're looking at how it's been put together sort of that way for me with talk radio now but see with mark\nFirst of all he's incredible I Love the show it's very different than my usual show actually um and and and frankly because he's on immediately after my show\nI you know I I'm going to buy these days\nThe news cycle the stories what's important what's happening now it changes five times\nBefore I'm On the air again Twenty one hours later so I could listen to mark and I love listening to

that it is coordinated and it is planned ended his organized by may use the word organized because you know organized is sort of a a a modification of the term organizer or if I may community organizer\nYou see our nation had a community organizer in chief and what we're seeing here this is what community organizing looks\nLike the the the demonstrations the moms the the screaming the disruptions the\nA black lives matter the uh the disruptions of the United States Senate the marches in the streets the stopping of traffic this is all community organizing\nAnd and I guess we should be used to it by now is this really how we want decisions made in this country based on the screaming in the streets based on the thousands of\nPeople demanding entry to work so we're so we're now going to change our immigration laws and accommodate these people were not going to make laws in the United states of America because thousands of people from another country charge across our border

you know you may disagree with his tweets you may disagree with it a little language he uses you may think that he stepped on his own message sometimes you get to listen and and guess what I Would agree with you on hold on most of that\nBut on the policy on the actual things that this president has been able to achieve\nI don't know how a conservative Republican on the whole could have an argument for what this president's been able to do with the judiciary with nominations to the courts with taxes\nWith military spending\nForeign policy even trade I'm not a huge fan of his rhetoric on trade but so far the threats of terrorists seem to have gotten results\nUh and and as far as I'm concerned blow up the tariffs against China they are not our friend there\nAre certainly not our economic friend so we've Republicans could actually follow his lead on this and ... and finally jump on board with\nRegard enforcing our immigration laws and drawing a very very firm line and the
