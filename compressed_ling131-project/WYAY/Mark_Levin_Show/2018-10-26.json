G. dot org [noise]\nCatch the good work show Saturdays at noon on the new talk one oh six seven\nFrom the Katie I'm reading dot com studios why you wind up to me the same\n[noise] [noise] political\nTerror deadly thong Hi Barbara Kuttab Miami bomb squad in a canine unit or sweeping a male facility in Florida it's where law enforcement officials now believe several of these suspicious packages sent a high profile Democrats and critics of President Trump were processed\nNew York governor Andrew Cuomo says the person sending these packages is to inflict terror and terror only works if you let it\nIt is wrong to say in my opinion are the these are fake bombs\nAttorneys for Roger Stone said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mile a subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other\nRight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month the asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses another investigation also said they were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed\nDC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\n\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone filed a motion to quash or otherwise resisted the grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know a Gibson Dunn and crunch or attorney who has handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nIt's unclear whether the case the appeals court has agreed to here in December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on my list that's already or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock\nAnd well I'll tell you it's not hard to tell at all Mr Miller ... challenged we\nKnow from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler under the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making\nAnd professor ... has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again because I have first hand knowledge but because\nWhat took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of its authority illegal legitimacy\nBefore ... judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of my list criminal cases but all the human defendants who set foot in a courtroom and ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel's authority or tactics\n\nMystery case is moving through the courts and Robin grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America our chief Eli seagulls fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nAnd a final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\nThis can't\nThis can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry Tiller recall the case from a previous investigation where you couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because there was under steal\nAll right\nI'm fairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller like counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause in the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court\nAnd despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst and others this is not the Martian versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and robbing the independent\nCounsel the elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calories his opinion respecting Mahler\nAnd this is why these two questions are important stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\nOr is he an inferior office\nFor purposes of a challenge\nTo the appointments clause of the constitution I have no doubt that he insists that he's an inferior officer who reports to deputy attorney general Rosen steam\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate he's nothing more than an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney or jeopardy to an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial\nAppointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that so this isn't like Morrison versus also know the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge I visit sorry I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd eyes more than ... suspect I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court in the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is uh is going to hear the case and again as I said that court\nIs heavily loaded with a a leftist activist so the the final case will have to be made to the Supreme Court if they'll accept it will be right back [noise] much\nThe new talk one oh six seven wearing leather comes to talk\nYesterday I got a call from the IRS they sing I owe them over sixteen thousand dollars I don't

what takes place in that state prior to the ... election as they would Texas and uh it's very important this rates the taking place in Florida and the Democrat is about as radical left as you can get\nIn the left all over the country is pouring millions and millions of dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects\nRhonda scientists who have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um\nTallahassee is a very corrupt government under this mayor there it's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government ah to get basically city money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars\nAnd so what the lobbyists did is they arrange the number of excursion one of which was the New York city um and along for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to infiltrate at\nA he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city of but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to go see the quite handle that many people hear about these Campbell to take a day to go to the movie\nTickets or at least a thousand dollars at that time I'm into he gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that Andrews lied about that but now there's been evident that showed that\nBut then those same lobbyists also arranged a luxury for night stay in the Costa Rica bill law which ended up talking about a thousand dollars a free Andrew and his wife a in a dish and some other folks\nAnd he got Andrew didn't pay for that and then what happens after all this mark\nLo and behold mayor Andrew Gillum\nTurns around and he gives those lobbyists that two million dollar deal that they were looking for it so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby it's got a exactly what they were paying for it so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew has he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about this\nBut then documents came out almost immediately that refuted is denial showed he was lying um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can cause he just refuses to take responsibility but at the bottom line of the older that day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you are very smart in the law you understand about\nWhat an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official that now the reason you would do such a thing\nOf course nobody knows if he's in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people in him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation every bad that my kids for your\nUm it's interesting we re ran an ad or basically talking about all this problem and his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said\nA public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject of the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put it in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said Andrew is not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission or because the bottom line is why would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to\nDo with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized position that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOr her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from
