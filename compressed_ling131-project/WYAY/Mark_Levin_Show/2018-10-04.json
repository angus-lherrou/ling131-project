provocative ... missile proliferation and malign behavior throughout the middle east for\nToday's decision by the international court of justice was a defeat for a run it correctly rejected nearly all of a runs request but we're disappointed that the icy Jay failed to recognize that it has no jurisdiction to issue any order with respect to sanctions the United states and poses\nTo protect its own essential security under the treaty\nInstead the court allowed Iran to use it as a forum for propaganda the Iranian regime has systematically pursued a policy of hostility toward the United states\nBut the famous the central premise of the treaty of amity the regime cannot practice animosity and its conduct and then ask for amity under international law\nAnd now the best part cut
