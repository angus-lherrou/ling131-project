family in some respects distant part of your family but the same with me I Know I'm blessed with you and the common thread in all this is our love of country\n\nThat's where you were taught that is what you believe that's what I was taught that's what I Believe there's some people in this country who don't love it who attack it who rip it apart cues their fellow citizens are being like Hitler and Nazis and racist and so forth\nThese are the forces these are the people we must defeat\nNo we can't right now to feed them in our public schools and college campuses we can't night right now defeat them in Hollywood in Beverly Hills in the entertainment industry we can't right now defeat them in the media the ladies in general we can defeat them at the ballot box\nIt's up to you\nAnd I'm Serious when I say I think about the power we have if we make sure three four five six seven people who we know and who will vote the right way get out and vote think of what election idle really looked like\n\nIt is in my view particularly in this election you're patriotic duty to take care of business here\nI really believe that\nYou're patriotic duty this is not just another election if we lose her grave consequences\nAnd so rather than have anxiety and frustration put your energy to work\nPut your energy into it you don't need people to tell you what to do you know what to do you know how to get other people involved in voting and so forth as your own precinct worker get out the vote I brought a number of candidates to you\nThere are still up on my Facebook and Twitter sites who need your help in close races\nA number of Kennedy\nAs I told you I don't believe in giving to the party bureaucracy I Believe in giving the candidates [noise] so\nI Would encourage you to look at them and support them and hopefully most of them will win on Tuesday but some of them won't\nBut the goal is to make sure most of them don't lose but most of them do it and I can't get down into every house fight but we have like forty seats that are close you may live in one of those districts\nOne of those seven districts in California one of those six or seven districts in Pennsylvania one of those three districts in New Jersey one of those four or five districts in New York\nThey're\nAll over the country you may live in one of those that's very very very important that you get involved\nEven in your own life that you get involved with a handful of people and make sure they vote and imagine if you do that and then a few others do that and so forth and so it would be a big deal it really would is there a silent majority up there\nWere about to find out are the poles right are are the polls wrong we're about to find out\n\nBut we should be focused like a laser forget about the static we should be focused like a laser\nYou know you love this country and you know there are candidates out there who do not\nTheir candidates out there who want to fundamentally change America I don't want to fundamentally change America I Love America\n\nYou know in Hollywood Bloomberg\nStyle hair Soros and others many others multi millionaires\nYou know that they they support a strongly centralized government because they know is multi millionaires they have enormous influence of the future this society and they want more influence over the future of this aside their ego maniacal their narcissistic\nWe have to fight this\nYou shouldn't be on the fence right now my fellow conservatives in Arizona you shouldn't be on the fence\n\nMy fellow conservatives in the ... district in Virginia where Barbara Comstock as you should be on the fence anymore\n\nMy fellow conservatives in the state of Nevada you shouldn't be on the fence anymore\n\nAnd we can go through all the states where the Republicans running or not necessarily that conservative but they still love the country they're not trying to tear it apart and it seems and that's the kind of race we have right now folks\nI Know you did test the media and you have every reason to test the media\n\nAnd not defending the first amendment there not defending freedom of the press we've talked about this before they're advancing a a radical ideological agenda that they're trying to disrupt this presidency they're trying to burden this presidency they're trying to undermine this presidency\nMuch like Russian TV they're like private stuff to like ... you get very little news from the news today right\n\nSo this election is very important and I look It's Wednesday I'm going to keep talking about this right up to election day on Tuesday night when I sit here and hopefully with millions of you\nAnd the return start coming in as we have every election cycle and we start analyzing what's going on a very good about this when these were turned started a comment Mr produce all ... and the Trump campaign around eight o'clock eight thirty I said to Mr producer Trump won this election he said what do you

Pensacola area\nFor the panhandle I said look at Pennsylvania\nYou said that Russia look at Pennsylvania I Know Pennsylvania and Ohio and North Carolina and\nWe had to leave the air but the dominant started to fall\n\nI'm hoping the same thing happens on Tuesday but it's not going to happen unless you get out and vote and bring some people with you or have some people vote\nYour voting early just make sure they vote it's a big deal if you have an elderly parent or grandparent you need to help them so they can vote\nNot a big deal you're not an Afghanistan you're not in Iraq you're not in Syria

like minded also boat and we will strongly a defeat the other side\nThat's right and and our national security I mean the embassy in Israel moving to Jerusalem the president not just fulfilling his own campaign promise and doing the right thing but filling promises of presidents past withdrawing from the fatally flawed Iran nuclear deal\nWithdrawing from the Paris accords were we were making these commitments on our end Waller country like China was agreeing to actually increase emissions\n... you know understanding their enemies do not respect\nWeakness they only respect strength we can't be silent not because we want more but because you want to prevent it we have right now a president any national security team behind\nThem that is ensuring that American exceptionalism is nothing to apologize for we are respected\nAgain and I love it we have to continue going the right direction and the president needs people in Congress who are going to support him when he has a backbone standing up to threats to our country that is how we protect ourselves a next generation that's how we protect our freedoms and liberties and I'll tell you as an army reservist I\nKnow that
