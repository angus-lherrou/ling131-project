I'd have to flip the coin between two Republican candidates in one man and once a woman\nI'd probably go for the check I I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why I got I think it makes\nUs look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most to nations fighters\nFor the conservative cause have been women I'm just more impressed by them\nAnd I think they're used to take him to death a little bit more and they can give it back a little bit better I think men are are are are are too easily touted by the media they they don't want to be called names\nThey don't want to be a a oh don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm not going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\nBut women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they\nHurt at all and they don't give a damn really the life I'd had\nFight my way and the professional world being married for decades raising kids raising grad and you think I'm going to be concerned about about a Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please I've given birth\nI don't I don't need to worry about you I've been through it all that I I tend to want to put the baby in there and I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp but I Do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference\nWhich truly shows that it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia that don't judge people by their chromosomal makeup we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha\nBecause I Want to show how woke I Am I'm I'm I'm more feminist than Alan Alda just wait I'll I'll you betcha I think that this is the way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one three at one one but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes uh they they want to show women\nHow incredibly wonderful they are looking hardly wants to I mean you couldn't have found a better Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified the very model\nOf a male Democrat in the United states of America\nHe gave the all the right causes he raised money for all the right candidates he was pro choice he he's never met an abortion he hasn't liked\nHe made sure that he was in the forefront of every liberal cause in America because see that was his suit of armor that was his protection\n\nHe was able to be as as abominable and sexist and horrible and despicable as a man can be but as long as he gets the where the mantle of feminist liberal Democrat\nWho checks all the boxes on the list of the causes the support and the candidates that you throw money at and raise money for a while then you'd get a free pass up to a certain point\nIt makes sense to me this is this is a Democrat do ... ah get the ...\nSay they they they can walk into what a coffee shop and order the right kind of ... and and\nWhere they are pro choice buttons and have a conversation with a barista about how they're going to the uh save the spotted whale rallied tomorrow\nAnd uh that's they're opening line\nThat's how they get their checks most of them married not the checks the ... about what do you think why do you think that is the heat seven seven three three eight one one and in general what do you do one to keep the mob\nAway from the reins of power twenty seven days from now let's go to Louis in Manhattan\nNew York New York city is a nice and into twice a year on the Marco then show on WB say what do you think\nYeah hey lower yet\nYeah oh yeah I I my myself a number of times in the Washington ...
