say\n\nThat she knows she only had one beer and was not on any medicate so she remembers those details\n\nOh Dr Ford's account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she her self identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\nShe's named three people other than judge Kavanaugh who attended the party mark judge Patrick PJ ... and her lifelong friendly Lynn Kaiser and by the way or the media have twisted\nOver the weekend what Kaiser and her lawyer put out their twisted it when in fact that changed nothing\n\nThe drunks and the perverts in the media have twist

not know Mr Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party are gathering where he was present with or without Dr Ford\nQuote unquote\nIn a subsequent statements of the committee
