want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations in these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again of birthright\nCitizenship you are hearing people who make absolutely\nNo sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar there that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort to curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statue will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it\nOr what have been done already these are the same people in Congress refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute outlawing birthright citizenship\nBut why pass a statute if in fact as the laugh says on some of these conservatives say 'cause they're no not things that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\nIf that's the case then how is the statue gonna ... statute won't fix it\nBecause they're saying you have to amend the constitution when's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way but a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps there\nAs we discuss the other day as I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\nBirthright citizenship was not actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies then Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy by the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and no statute was passed so why do we have you met in the constitution or pass a statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of a cabin all was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\nThe president happens to be right about this president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happened to be wrong he knows more than I Do\n\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today left this concocted an ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they when you have the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship\nWith a left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous presidents\nThat plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq while collectively ignoring enlist uninterrupted case law indicating the opposite\nOff for the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F wealth and Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in medically that it was quote\nEstablishments no new right declaring no no principle on quote quote it is not the object to this bill to establish new rights but to protect and enforce those which belonged to every citizen unquote that's what he declared in Nineteen sixty six I Want you to think about it\nHow many states ratify this amendment\nIf they believed it wouldn't be applied to illegal alien babies\nKnown as birthright citizenship not a one\n\nMan was passed their bread tech African American former slaves\nNot foreigners yet to be born\nWho have no right to come into this country illegally\nPeriod\nThe notion that an amendment designed to grant freed slaves who lived here for centuries and had no allegiance to any other jurisdiction the basic rights of American citizens would be used as a tool to prevent Congress from regulating citizenship for immigrants of all stripes is scandal is\n\nThe first sentence the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state we're in they reside we need not speculate what subject to the jurisdiction there are means as I said the other day\nSenator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at that time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to its complete jurisdiction quote not only allegiance to anybody else on quote\nOf course persons present inside American territory are subject to our partial jurisdiction in the sense that they have to obey our laws and our subject to criminal prosecution for disobeying our laws but one congressional drafted added a second phase of jurisdiction to citizenship clause\nThey require it clearly limiting citizenship to those who in the words of one of the three key draft ers were subject to complete\nAnd we will never allow violence or anti Semitism to take hold in the United states former

go ahead and tell us the big issues where you stand and where your opponent stance\nAbsolutely well I think as many people are beginning to really follow the U.S Senate race in West Virginia they're seeing that there couldn't be a bigger contrast between the Republican and the Democratic candidate that let's start at the base I'm a conservative fighter mark you know I took on the Obama administration I assume\nWe had big victories in court it was West Virginia that led the way to defeat the Obama power plant that was just this amazing power grab over the United states energy supply\nWe lead the way built the twenty seventh state coalition we stopped Rocco bomb at the U.S Supreme Court fact it was the last major decision\nOf Justice Scalia's lie that was the big deal we've let on many other big issues taking on the federal government in their own lawful unless I'm strongly pro life endorsed\nBy all the pro life groups because not only check the box on the issue of life\nBelieve in the fact of life and I'm actually in part responsible for a lot of the changes which have evolved in West Virginia so we have protections for the unborn\nI'm also strongly in support of the second amendment and our gun rights and we're working tirelessly to help President Trump we think President Trump has been doing incredible things for the country\nAnd for West Virginia and I'm proud to stand with him or running a campaign partnering up with this president because he is helping turn us around now the flip side of that\nIs you're dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion and he's just another one of these Washington politicians he went to Washington he drank the water and now he's in cahoots with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and all the radical liberals including Hillary Clinton on the issue of life\nHe sold out west Virginia values he actually literally has signs saying that he supports Planned Parenthood and also that he stood with life on the issue of life that's not a multiple choice questions you\nNeed someone who is pro life who opposes taxpayer funding of abortion who wants to stop the government funding a Planned Parenthood on the issue is Second Amendment we need someone who's going to stand against the gun grabbers mansion his best known for offering a big gun control bill and\nOn the issue of coal oh I have to say is this he doubled down on his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between dishonest Washington\nLiberal Joe mansion and conservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win an election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you it's because he not only support to he doesn't trust your image and I noticed throughout his career in the Senate he waits and weights and waits to see if he can throw a safe vote\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about this\nYear right and I think vice president Mike Pence said it very well he said quote Joe ... is always there when you don't need him and\nYou're like re live off\nThat terrific line and and really accurate about match ...\nNow what are your priorities among you you mentioned a number of them is most he supported the president's tax cuts you reject this caravan you went to wall on the southern border\nRunning man well absolutely so let's START I agree with\nAll the above the Trump's tax cuts are good for West Virginia\nNot only doubling the standard deduction which helps a lot of hardworking families in our state the lowering of the rates are but we also have other changes here they're really helping lift our economy up to levels we haven't seen before when you combined the Trump tax cuts more with the deregulatory approach\nI mean let's face it onto the ... Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses out of work and certainly they went after fossil fuels\nI get up and I said no to that nonsense when I found those lawsuit and President Trump well he's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia\nWe need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes\nAnd then ultimately deregulating so the regulations fulfill a more basic purpose markets you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either\nIndividually or within our communities we're on the local level when you have federal regulations in place there has to be a very compelling health safety well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the rock Obama era or they went so far beyond the pale\nPresident Trump is doing it right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote and the U.S Senate would have power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the people of West Virginia [noise] they need to understand that when Hillary Clinton and her bunch talked about deplorable they're talking about people hardworking men and women blue collar men and women like the wonderful citizens\nAnd you don't have to work for NASA to get one you just need to call it five five nine seven nine NASA\nOr is it now say ... dot com slash nine seven nine that's eight five five nine seven nine NASA or NASA ... dot com slash nine seven nine get into that new home with zero down zero BMI and a little help from NASA federal\nThat's smart massive smart for more information ... five five nine seven nine NASA or click NASA Suu dot com slash nine seven nine equal housing lender offer ballad on approved credit for primary residences membership eligibility required animal is number forty six by\nThree followers on Twitter talk one of six seven Atlanta\n\n\n\nI can hear a lot of activity which trick or treaters\nNow my own view about this is the fewer trick or treaters of the better you know Mr producer exactly more candy for me I'm just kidding for crying out loud\nThere was a time at the bunker when I used to put out I've told you this before a big bowl of Hershey bars I don't mean the tiny little ones one bite I mean the big ones not the big big ones but a real Hershey bar\nAnd I used to put out a big bowl of them used to have like three balls in them and I would do it during the course of the broadcast during the breaks\nInto a few years ago\nWhen I Would do that and patently some kids are teenagers took all the Hershey bars\nAnd so there were no not ... but the another ball out they did it again so I stopped and I shut the lights out and said that's not enough of that", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "31"}
