that voice now eight seven seven three one two three eight one one was an honor\nTo have the ambassador to the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's a\nWhile it to you know a horrific act or worse than a medic attacking and us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday that to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive I'm with Senator Casey was there we had a\nCongressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight knit\nIt's not just among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of most from leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the humidity is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and start a and what I wanted to do with Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with that that they're not alone\nAnd that and Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday 'cause some days like Monday and Israel the first day of the week\nAnd the government meets every Sunday and there was this a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel stood because we are the one and only Jewish state and so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why it was important for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nNow you were born in Miami I just want people to know this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami or brother was the mayor of Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach where it was about that yeah we're the ones that I speak that that's true um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you are an Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout Europe\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nOr we kind of it is it's going to say a growing problem or many people want to say that it began to two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election\nSimply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen\nA hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half\nOf hate crimes against religious groups and the United states not only two percent of the population market their accounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of an\nAttack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is dead it's once again become fashionable or to attack twos and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America it's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris\nAttacks against choosing ... attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six of the federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen at a Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives\nAnd this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media because you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people\nUm you could have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there's a stream\nIs can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis that could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people\nGoing into social media is you have this rise of these online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel we monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here and I know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them are we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see one sort of\nThis kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other\nI think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to\nPrevent the next attack and you and says armed guards at many of your scenario yeah that's\nThat's a reality that unfortunately juice face around the world if you go to London and the Pentagon you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman or a police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen in America I Do think that on high holidays\nThey have a treatment system to make your roof last even longer it's true and don't forget if you have something rattling up there may be a piece of gutter or some citing that's all whacked out of some kind of hanging onto your roof\nThey do all that to you don't have to call three different people the one stop price
