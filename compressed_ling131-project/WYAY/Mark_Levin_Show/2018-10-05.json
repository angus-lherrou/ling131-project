faith like healthy vibrant people of Judaism is a good thing for this country and a good thing for the world where do you say\nTo be better state and I mean we as I mentioned ... to reiterate what I said before\nWe we stand then would fight to the death to protect the rights\nOf liberty for everyone not just ourselves that's not a self interest thing it is what is it we blame on the bottom our hearts that everyone ought to be free everyone is made in God's image everyone has an alien I'm All right in this country to liberty\nAnd we do Dale Jews and Christians have such a healthy attitude toward a morality and toward God and we ... we share the same\nAbsolute values and these values guide us and govern our society and our entire a constitutional framework\nIs based on those values and no other country in the history of the world even comes close\nTo the principles that under this a constitutional republic there are some great empires that they were empires America's not even an empire and that is the most powerful nation and the history of the world that could have dominated and taking over the world that it has been benign is\nBeing selfless and not selfless that his work is looked at its own self interest but it is not sought to conquer other nations and exploit other nations contrary to the to the left\nA history revision as in uh in every respect most both domestically and form a our religious principle or or what stand behind the things that make this country great\nAnd tell you something a and I'd been reading through your book and it is fascinating to me as a non Christian\nUm you write beautifully you write in a way that's totally understand well these are very complicated subjects you know you can get really way down or you can get caught in the weeds and you don't do any of that\nUh and uh and and you can see the uh the decency and you're writing the Ernest ... in your writing\nAnd uh and you raised a point earlier when we were talking a and the first segment and that is and just mentioned it again the founding of this nation people need to understand\nUh that the men who founded this nation\nNot all of them but almost all of them were Christians\nWho met at the uh who met and I'm On July Fourth with a declaration of independence and men in Philadelphia again in the constitution and look at what they did even look at the first amendment what they did they didn't establishments religion even though they could have potentially\nAnd yet they allow freedom of religion so in other words these are Judeo Christian attitudes and principals the reformation all these things that affected these faiths\nAnd so while people may say well I'm an atheist while I I you know I'm I'm this religion I'm of that and I differ and I don't agree with you\nThey can say that as you point out and they're free to do whatever they want but what they cannot say is that the founders of the country the frame or is that the constitution were not a religious men they were religious in their own way and to different degrees but these were men of faiths were they not\nYes and and that's been documented in and\nA lot of people want to the Bronx that because it is in the interest of the secularists to uh say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and that when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation or back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was\nBut we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watch the totalitarian tendencies it'll last\nA as Obama tried to bring on and he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation and then nothing like it appeared at the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this\nAnd you know that his son in mental transformation was not a restoration of where we started about a radical transformation away from it and the completion of the destruction of our founding principles in my view\nNow again not [laughter] I won't say I'm an expert on this subject won't even say I'm close to that but the way you're dividing\nWritings on this and you kind of touched on at the beginning is how is how and then where do you go from here\n[noise] okay I Am\nA again wanting to complete my Journey Through the New Testament I'd already written some

Collins this afternoon delivered the most remarkable speech I've ever heard that senator deliver\nWho the heck happened a year at a\nA lot of interesting the interesting things going on but in the context that there are two sides to stores and one side effects that Thursday you had so many people including the aforementioned Susan Collins who is unbelievable today\nWho said that you know what she was really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believable and ah you know so it was Brett Kavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people\nYeah you know they both were no they weren't not no they were not going to be right somebody was lying somebody was committing perjury\nSomeone testifying last Thursday was really really committing an act of evil\nAnd that person based on all the information available is Christine for the soul now people are treating her with kid gloves but in this moment where by age to vote margin we're advancing to the final votes tomorrow and Brett Kavanaugh approximately five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important that Christine Ford\nSaying that she is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her but she is not allowed to just went off into the sunset is so she never made those claims now there's not going to be any accountability there's no way in the world of the the Senate Judiciary committee is going to pursue her for perjury\nThey should they should there should be a full investigation of her but as long as I have an opportunity to do so what she did it's an act of evil Christine for\nTrying to ruin a man's wife said she is one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said it's wrong\nThat's wrong and it's important that when we are confronted with the axis of evil in this society be false accusations by someone like Christine Ford they are called out for what they are and she is made to to have to account for what she is which is a perpetrator\nA woman who committed an act of evil but there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay it's ... I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murders somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nThey absolutely are held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do to break out and I am one hundred percent certain\nIt was Brett Kavanaugh was she not trying to effectively ruined that man's life his family's life\nHow evil do you have to do that so I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did\nAnd it's important once again and we don't just white off because break out I was going to make it through this thing and ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored because there will be others we end up a thorn in the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know know Chuck Schumer's credibility or the Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in ... I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just why you know\nNot and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are we're on ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes in right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise then we all need to acknowledge\nWhat happened here and who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are now a couple of things\nAre just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way\nIt really has been that kind of a wake hasn't that kind of a couple of weeks a kind of three months I mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas and and understand well Kavanaugh has been through an emotionally then it was kind of feel like we were through another election here this whole cabinet thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... uh yourself for the friend\nI don't want to show my home station W.

just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the market then show just to go straight to the FBI place\nNow on right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career is the single most common question I have a receipt and the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem they most people in this is true conservatives to by the way it's it's not like this is unique to liberal is there a lot of close minded conservatives to but you've got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life you know I mentioned the Kavanaugh\nPolling firm gala that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time but said in other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable and Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you\nYou just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now eating and all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy so if you want to be persuasive the first thing\nI find the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make just by lack unit because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nFor that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open\nThat information they're just going to view you as someone who is highly political trying to can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable\nOr is that they are analytical and that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way this surprises a lot of people but I find that common link there the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being illegal to drink the youngest one's my oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now and I have not blame them ride along because when was it that they came of age\nThey came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them and then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was one our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this Kevin situation to articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of the sexual assault we had the awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad\nBy the time that we got out there and he's ... now the wind had blown and drifted the smell up again side of my house blocking the
