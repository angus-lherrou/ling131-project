investigates sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh corresponding Caitlin Collins on the president's reaction to Kevin ... drinking habits\nAsked if he'll pull Kavanaugh's nomination if it's proven he lied Trump said I was surprised at how\nA vocally was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank\nBecause if you file false criminal complaint you can be charged with a felony\n\nOr maybe they're afraid that the case will be taken or they'll go to court and the lows\n\nHaven't they filed a criminal complaint and then they talk about we want an FBI\nThat to you so you think there's actually a criminal investigation going on here against Kavanaugh that those are real live criminal investigation now there's not there's nothing to do with a criminal investigation I Will\nBe honest with you I suggested the two senators on the Senate Judiciary committee that\nDr Ford why she doesn't walk into the Montgomery County police department and file a criminal complaint you know what those senators said to me Mr producer nothing they ignored me\n\nWell what if she does not what it is Ramirez does good instead we get reporters we get get people giving their opinions we get this when I started the show with a real lot prosecutor\nWho sent a memo to the Republican senators laying out a huge list of in discrepancies a memory lapses of contradictions respecting back or forward crickets nobody gives a\nDamn before that she was track ... she's an incompetent incompetent my but she was great\nThese are facts\nSo why why didn't\nMiss Ford's Dianne Feinstein hand ... lawyer\nDebbie Katz\nTake her clients hand and walk into the Montgomery County police department in Maryland\nThey dare not do it they dare not do it\nOr ms ... lawyer they dare not\nDo it or they're at\nThey dare not do it instead just keep them we need an FBI investigation isn't it interesting that the Three Stooges of the Republican Party Collins Murkowski\nAnd flake not one of them\nSaid you know I feel a lot better if she'd actually saw a you know filed a criminal complaint I Would have felt a lot better how come they didn't say\nBecause they're afraid that's why\nNow you hear this now on Fox some short tonight somebody will bring it up some former prosecutor or whatever that's OK I'm used to this but it's an important point\n\nHe said because in a court of law and it's like having all does that the presumption of innocence and a quarter law there is due process and a quarter law that's a criminal case it's beyond a reasonable doubt but as a prosecutor Rachel Mitchell set in her paper there's not even a preponderance\nOf evidence here and I would add there's no evidence\n\nSo we have a circus we have the Roman Colosseum and everybody's gathered\n'cause now the lines are going to kill the Christian just broke Kavanaugh in their in their everybody's excited everybody cheering\nWhat you mean due process due process she's up against the law is what the hell do we care\nWhat do we care\nThese phrases innocent until proven guilty apparently they only apply to a al ... terrorists and mass murders\nNot to a federal judge not\nThe federal judge you got Frank Rich that part's tweeted Kevin O's bragging about coaching girls' basketball as troubling in retrospect and why is that Frankie\nWhy is that you\nUse nibbling moron or judge lego whoever the hell that is in retrospect Kavanaugh using a girls' basketball team as a prop during his confirmation hearing doesn't seem like a coincidence really jot now they're sick go\n\nMother's sick I go down the list are so called\nFree media not a free media on free media\nThe way they cherry pick their stories they're partisanship it's obvious to everybody even the people who watch these these carbon\nFootprint says CNN and MSNBC they know their partisan that's why they watch 'em all twelve people\n\nBut I go back to my point I always have to say these things five times or so just to make sure even the media here me not a single accuser has filed a criminal complaint with the statute of limitations would not have run and has not run in Montgomery County Maryland\nNot one and I'll tell you something else\nOne of the reasons they think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about Canada is they know he's a federal judge and they know he seeks to be on the Supreme Court so they know he will not sue them for defamation\n\nAnd if he sued Dr Ford for defamation\nShe would lose even on a public person standard she would lose she has no evidence\nIf he sued ms Ramirez she would lose if he sued Avon body and this time they would lose you\nCan accuse people of the most violent things with no evidence with no witnesses no core operation\nIt's a slam dunk now might take a few years but they know he won't they know he can't given his interest and still being a Supreme Court justice and eventually if not returning to the or staying on the DC circuit\nThese accusers and their lawyers and the Democrats in Congress fear the legal system the legal

his sexual misconduct accusers and she's written by a guy named Michael Burke has asked the FBI to investigate text messages that Kavanaugh and his allies center friends before her story was made public\nTerri Burch who was a year and when Kavanaugh was accused of exposing himself to Ramirez emailed FBI agent Jaycee McDonalds so these people are leaking now asking the agency to review those messages are just part of its reopen background investigation that Kavanaugh NBC News reported\nNBC reported that text messages between birch I'm an ... a year at Savage a friend of Kavanaugh suggest the high Court nominee was discussing with marriages accusations with former classmates before the publication of a New Yorker piece about the allegations\nYarish Savage reportedly said one message that Kevin I tried getting hurt to publicly defending him\nRight two points\nBefore a story just published or broadcast typically what happens is reporters go around and they ask questions\nThey ask questions\nThey may even a vast Kavanaugh about it but they ask other people and they speak to other people and somebody could tell say Kavanaugh what's going on Kavanaugh here's about who they're going to publish this story and the New Yorker\nAnd he asks and I'm just taking it as it states that they could be dead wrong and he says to his friend um well\nI Hope you'll come to my defense you know I never did anything like that\nThis is really innocent\nWhat they're trying to say is while he wouldn't have known about it but for the fact that he did what what Ramirez says\nThat's not true that is not true\nIf he heard that there was a story coming out maybe he was contacted maybe wasn't somebody else might have been contacted because house as a reporter write a story there asking

it's a winner take all situation like abortion like Obamacare whatever\nThe issue is it's a winner take all\nThat's not at all what the constitution created and so in many respects with a post constitutional government they post constitutional Supreme Court and on and on and on we absolutely do and I've talked about that at length I've written about it at length\n\nWhat you're watching now is the breakdown\nOf the constitutional order in the United States Senate respecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this is the institution of the United States Senate as it sits today is not what the constitution created\nIt's not what the constitution created you had this progressive movement that became especially strong\nEarliest period the turn of the last century the early Nineteen hundreds of his building in the late Eighteen hundreds near the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always\nA desired result for the hard left and then you have the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy the United States Senate senators are elected way members of the house are elected no there are six year terms of course\nBut their elected by the people of the state the Senate has no actual purpose anymore\nOh I understand treaties and so that's not my point in terms of its fundamental foundational\nPurpose it's been bastard us\nThe Senate collectively was supposed to represent the states collectively\nIn the federal Congress to members from each state states would determine how they're chosen they can be elected by the people although very few where they can be selected by the state legislatures most of the more\nBut the so called populism movement\nAnd the progressive movement eliminated that\n\nAnd so you have this kind of pure democracy as opposed to Republicanism when it comes to the United States Senate and you see the consequences of that\nYou also see the consequences and another institution the United States Supreme court the United States Supreme court even though some of my constitutional is in conservative friends heated Lee disagree with me I had written about this and the ... versus Madison decision the Supreme Court seized power\nSeized power from the other federal branches\n\nJefferson knew immediately what took place as did other individuals who are believed in diversified a government\nHave libertarians today that argue strongly in favor of Madison versus Marbury and when you really read the case and you know the history of it it's a ... not only the constitution but the parties involved\nThere's no way Marshall chief justice Marshall should have been involved in that decision I'm not going to go down that road right now I'm just I'm just explaining that the Supreme Court's power today is far beyond anything that was contemplated by the framers of the constitution and certainly the rabbit fires in the states the states\nWe're still very suspicious of the central government and the constitution almost was not ratified\nIn Massachusetts in New York and in Virginia hence the federalist papers the advocates for\n\nTwo of them from New York and one of them from Virginia John J. Hamilton and mad as they honestly believe that they had created a governing system that would protect the American people not just from monarchy\nBut for mob rule and more and more we're both\nWith the permanent government in Washington DC and the lifetime appointees on the Supreme Court\nAnd mob rule\nBecause of the the unraveling of our Republican little are Republican system so you see the development of these factions and the faction on the left has become extremely violent extremely aggressive\n\nWell that's restaurants are airports whether it's hands teeth are black lives matter\nBefore that other movements in the Nineteen sixties\nThe weather underground and the association between these radical elements in members elected members of the Democratic party is really quite shocking\nAbsolutely shocking and the association between them and most of our media is unconscionable\nAbsolutely unconscionable this is why the constitution is so important and this is why Republicanism is so important\n\nAnd the left keeps trying to destroy them one of the reasons if not the main reason that you see the the obliteration\nOf the confirmation process when it comes to the Supreme Court one of the reasons you see it is because Kavanaugh has pro fast he has declared that he's a constitutional is\nThe enemy of the progressive state is the enemy of the Democrat leadership in Washington the enemy of the Democrats' Senate members on the Judiciary Committee is the constitution truth be told it's why they always talk about precedent\nNot the text of the constitution not being original meaning of the constitution that's why they always\nDeclare that our original documents our founding document and our governing document\nAre really no legitimate in many ways you say because too many that people who are involved in the process were slave holders\nTherefore they are to be dismissed or used\nIn order to advance their destruction in the cause of progressive as again you're seeing this play out in the United States Senate not to the extent we're discussing it here intellectually but this is the consequence\nFactions a defamation violence\nOr we're going to take a look exactly what I'm Talking about when we return I'll be right back [noise] much\n\nYou know it's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes by you know what is smart zip recruiter dot com slash Levin L.
