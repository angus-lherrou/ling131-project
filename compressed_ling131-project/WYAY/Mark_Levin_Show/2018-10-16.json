what I really did write a book on it literally at a was one of the great projects of my life I really enjoyed it [noise] but there's been a break in that case\nA real break in the case over the weekend I should say break a revelation to break in the case up in a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe who's been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice in at the upper level management the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks are here's what happened this week it let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nAre seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been on both parties or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and\nIt's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone for\nThe Donald Trump people's spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly a vow exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell so very walkie case\nMy book as expensive footnotes audit even by by use liberal foot notes that way the liberals can't repeat what they said in the past on it\nBut the cases very simple in its essence opposition political parties from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases law enforcement community in case of the FBI the upper levels and their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it now why am I bring that amount not to give you ... what what's great what else is there are lots to talk about them bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe\nUnleash the just the port of information and Maria ... show on Fox News and that that Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going to remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at a time a presidential candidate the explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seem to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole is all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha bank that's in my book lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you\nThe reason the story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on\nThe alpha bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out there no shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals Paris is to\nHave snow George Papadopoulos did George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information that there you go bingo we got\nWas Asian gentleman what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a fight that court there is a verification process for the information that you're supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it means the case that the the target let me give you an easier example this book sometimes a little complicated me ever been a federal agent\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search for that I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence and this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing their job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nOr significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of is that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale almost made up but the information they presented to the Pfizer court\nWas not that folks\nWas not that it was only this stuff alleged basically in the ... and here say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\n[noise] important folks\nBecause of this whole entire case right now is married to this latest narrative this is all they have\nIf the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI and information that guy they were targeting was not guilty at all this whole thing collapses the whole ... that's why this is so critical now what's the big question here\nThe big question is what is the exculpatory evidence and I want to put to potential theories out there for you\nPer se [laughter] you know they want to say I have a lot of roles is what I tried to\nSay you know why it's so hard to get a group photo of Stacey Abrams supporters buys it hard to do that while every time you say cheese aligned forward [laughter]\nThank you [laughter]\nI Know I order overplay by and they're very thing we'll Stormy Daniels you
