Ninety eight bucks and the United states you\nCan even legally work fulltime and earn less than sixteen thousand dollars a year\nSo yeah the minimum wage in the United states which as I pointed out a

P. C. C. report we now have twelve years to avert climate catastrophe\nThat might not ... but it means we're good deal further away from doomed than we were in two thousand seven when the WWF said we have five years to save the world the doomsday clock hadn't moved in two thousand eleven when the international Energy Agency ward now we would have five years\nTo start slashing carbon emissions or lose that chance for ever\nBy last year it is short and to three years according to Christina figures the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change but now it's right up at twelve years presumably\nMeaning that we can pretty much twin or or thumbs until twenty thirty a whole Eighteen years after\nThe WWF told us the world would come to an end if we didn't slash carbon emissions\nTheir tongue in cheek approach to pointing out how disingenuous dishonest and wrong in the United nations has been year after year after year with their doomsday you report but what happens year after year after year\nYou have the same folks in the media the same folks on the left saying votes in education\nAnd raise it I go oh my gosh they're going to this now do you manage it I I you

oh six seven\n[noise]\n\n\n\nVoice of America in every shoveling several ... warm water\nTo sort of looks like there was tornado so you just spots where [noise] you know everything was down and you see you know it's like a tornado weather [noise]\nBut he is Florida's governor Rick Scott who is term\nLimited and actually running against Bill Nelson for the United States Senate one of the most the board races in the country because Rick has a chance at a Republican pickup Bill Nelson has not faced a tough competition pretty much at any point he's won his election in Florida by five twenty two\nAnd Eighteen points and Rick Scott right now is in a statistical tie a it's kind of unfortunate ... even ... it's been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way\nAh I'm Brian mud inform articles and by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but but nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea in a comparison real quick a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have some of those images in your head and one of the things that\nI ended up noticing\nWhen we're taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures do look an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado\nOr this you know in hurricanes a lot of people but to focus on the category and the tops of state when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them ... about almost anything but the went just as you saw with boards and the Carolinas just as you saw with Harvey\nIn Houston last year it's the flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage and death and hurricanes\nRarely is it about the when now Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you got the F. one through the five tornadoes go right\nWith top sustained winds at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very for Jim I got my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack I think I Am I got my parents and my sister my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma I hit them directly\nThat being alright ironically and I'm On the other coast um southeastern Florida\nUm I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us they were without power for like going to say actually fared better where Hurricane Irma struck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother in Panama City beach use all the reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea and he will as a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as governors constant like a tornado\nBut there's something else that is kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be on any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf I'd take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI ah had an idea there was one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nIn the affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but debris and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look at the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before those standards with brain homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing\nBy and large are your structures\nThat were built after Ninety two with those upgraded and updated standards to me the difference not only in life and death but it can make the difference in your home being there versus your home being wiped out can make the difference between a community that can be rebuilt and something that is an even recognize
