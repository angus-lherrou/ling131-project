A. Y. Janesville Mueller station where\nFollow us on Twitter talk one oh six seven had lied to\nThe cabinet investigation Trump well I'm In ... the White House is awaiting the results of the FBI probe into sexual assault allegations lodged against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAs he headed for a speech in Philadelphia the president said things appear to be going well for Brett Kavanaugh buddy edited all all depend on what comes out of the supplemental investigation being conducted by the FBI the indicated it would be unacceptable if Kavanaugh is found to have lied to Congress\nI don't think you should lie to Congress under a lot of people over the last year that have lives that Congress to me that would that be acceptable\n\nListen to this these maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue service the times found little resistance from the Internal Revenue\nOther words do you think for two seconds if the IRS\nThat any of this was illegal that they wouldn't be resisting it\n\nThe president's parents spreading married Trump transferred well over a billion dollars in a while to their children which could have produced they tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million under the ... fifty five percent tax rate then imposed on gifted in Iran says\nNow that is absurd you have all kinds of deductions over a period of time you have what's called

never\nProduces something like this on the Clinton Foundation in library\nRight on the nuclear deal\nTwenty percent of the uranium the speeches and all the right now don't bother to Clinton's no no way\n\nHarder sought to distance Mr Trump from the tax strategies used by his family's saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives in tax professionals\nWell of course he did you know distancing yourself it's the same exact way the family that owns the New York times handles it they don't do their own taxes\nPresident Trump and virtually no environment whatsoever these matters he said the fares were handled by other Trump family members who are not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law why\nDoesn't the New York times except that point even as they go on they can't accept that point that Trump didn't do his own taxes and then he relied on professionals and others\nThe president's brother Robert Trump issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family are dear father Fred Trump passed away in June of Nineteen Ninety nine are below the mother Mary Ann Trump passed away in August

get to the truth no all they do is interview people and ask them questions to write it up and handed over it's only been said four billion times that that's what a background check is\n\nSo what is it that the FBI needs to find out now if they really did interview\nDr Ford then they should take with them\nProsecutor Rachel Mitch roles mental and as well as several the points on raising and then have Dr Ford square the circle\nThat would be a real criminal investigation\nAnd they could do the same with Canada but I don't see any contradictions in his testimony deal\nI really don't\nI don't
