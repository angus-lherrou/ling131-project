resident Trump will be briefed tomorrow on the death of a Washington Post columnist\nIt's an issue the president could not have wanted but he finds himself frustrated according to a guy with the Saudis handling of the killing of ... in there it's been both consul lived the president is upset with what makes them look having a good relationship with the Saudis and he expresses his anger in the way he knows best deal only this one to cover up alleged murder\nThen deal in the Netherlands or somebody really messed up and endorse cobra ever they were sure their stuff is at the deals them for what they thought about it 'cause whoever's on them that I did [noise] I think is a big deal\nNow Medicare for all\n\nAlso nearly double the size of the federal government double the size of the federal government a recent analysis of Bernie Sanders current Medicare for all plan which is supported by Gillum and people like him\nFind said it would cost the federal government thirty two point six trillion dollars over the first time\nAnd we know these analyses are always wrong they're always low thirty two point six trillion dollars plus free college for everybody\nRight free health care\nThe trustees Medicare say Medicare is going broke and eight years eight years so the Democrats have a plan massively expanding and destroy it\n\nIncredible\nAnd that's a vast understatement of its true costs since the analysis assumes direct Kony and payment cuts the providers an unrealistic savings on administrators and prescription drug costs and also ignores the enormous cost of delays in rationing that invariably result from government run health care in other words\nAll the people who will die all the people who will suffer when the government takes over a system like this\n\nDemocrats pushing Medicare for all say that those costs are irrelevant\nBecause people will no longer have to pay premiums are spend any money out of pocket but they don't say is that everyone would face huge tax increases to finance this government takeover of healthcare Bernie Sanders plan starts with an eight point four percent hike in payroll taxes\nSharply higher income tax rates and more none of which would fully cover the exorbitant costs\n\nHow many more failed countries ladies in general must we caught me this is Venezuela this is the prescription of Venezuela\n\nPhony support for Medicare for all Democrats\nAlso point just surveys showing strong support choose me for Medicaid for Medicare for all a Reuters so St Paul found Seventy percent backing it including a majority of Republicans but that's because people have no idea what Medicare for all actually means\nRun Reuters substitutes the term single payer or government run health care support collapses was little is forty percent down from Seventy percent\nAnd that's exactly why the Democrats camouflage their true intentions lie and deceive the American people\n[noise] but even that's probably too high forty percent eight separate Kaiser Family foundation survey found almost half of Americans wrongly believe\nThey could actually keep their existing health plans under a single payer system incredibly Democrats are the most ill informed the poll found fifty two percent of Democrats think there'll be able to keep their health care plans\n\nI mean that's absurd right if they're going to nationalize healthcare a single payer system destroy Medicare destroy all private insurance including your employer insurance by going to keep your plan\nStill lack of public support didn't stop Democrats from opposing Obama Care of the nation eight years ago won't stop them from opposing quote unquote Medicare for all they ever get the chance the\nOnly way to prevent such a disaster is to keep Democrats had a power at least until their socialist fevers breaks this is another reason you need to go to the polls ladies and gentleman\nThese rogue leftists are so thoroughly completely irresponsible they want to impose their ideology on you and these have real life\nConsequences it matters to your family it managed to the health of your family it matters that people who have private insurance it
