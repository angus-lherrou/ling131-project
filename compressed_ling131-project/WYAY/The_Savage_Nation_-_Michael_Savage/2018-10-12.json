for all for ten sixty seven eight for for ... for ten sixty seven it's only the ...\nNow I did I Can't decide whether this is\nReally a a precious and sweet and wonderful or a little too kinky\nBut there's a movement called the purity movement among basically America's evangelical population where teenage girls will make pledges to their fathers to stay virgins until they're married\nAnd it's a big time Charlie deal\nIt started in Colorado Springs Twenty years ago\nIt spread to forty eight states in Seventeen countries now they have what are called purity balls\nDaughters pledged to remain virgins until they get married the formula occasion as a girl's dressing up and long white gowns and the father's wearing suits tuxedos mostly dinner jackets they have a dinner and a dance and there are things that resemble the wedding ceremony at the ceremony fathers are given a key\nRepresenting the key to their daughters chastity to eventually pass on to their daughters' future husband so he gets the key to her father and daughter then sign of purity contract the daughters are given a purity ring to wear on their wedding ring finger ah one\nSeventeen year old girl Hannah powers are said the Bible says sex before marriage is a sin and I believe in doing this purity ball because it's like a symbol to tell everybody this is what I Am doing and you may not accepted you may think it's weird but it's what I Want to do because I Want to take the stand for what I Believe\nI Want to make a promise to myself and God that I Will stay pure 'til they get married I don't have to have sex and no one's loved\nNow\nOr her or a father of course it says he's totally awkward it's an honor to have someone say they're going to remain a pure and wait I Believe one thing the father says she'll get rewarded for it it's going to be hard and she'll be judged and laughed at and hopefully she can take the heat now the girl admitted she's kissed a boy she Seventeen she's kissed a boy but she sworn off\nSex until she's married she's getting kind of a backlash or even though she believes there is power in submission one\nGirl said she was sexually active ... active up at a very very young age remember being very disappointed after the first time and think well you gotta be kidding me that was it that she felt devalued and not worthy of a feeling good about yourself that led her to become a stripper then she did some other bad things and then said I Believe in the power of submissions elites young girls are voluntarily choosing to be a beat into their\nNow the problem is there a lot of folks are saying wait a minute you gotta be kidding oh is this just goes to show that demand is in charge of a woman's chastity and uh you know that it's sort of an old fashioned and the sexist\nAnd I can't decide I mean I Can't imagine I mean I think it's great that if a girl wants to wait 'til she is married to you know go all the way that's that's fantastic but I Can't imagine being a tuxedo\nGiving or you know getting getting a ring from my daughter or a key for my daughter and giving her a ring to promise not to have sex till she's married in a big formal ceremony dinner dancing with your daughter and stuff on talking about giving up your virginity\nYeah isn't that though the definition of choice there may have choice absolutely\nAnd voluntarily it's not like they're being you know they are playing I'll give you a car if you don't ... I mean there's not that it's just they willing we want to do this it's a religious thing more than anything else\nWhich we gotta you gotta support their right to do whatever they feel is right which I I Can't see me\nGoing the way you know stay a burgeoning ceremony with my two daughters that as well as good or not now [laughter] it's all laid out well [laughter] I'm pretty sure it's a it's a part

you helped us get that thing waving like crazy and God Bless America separate find my friend that's good to know about you\nBuddy Guy's book you may and there you go\nAs it should be although I feel I feel bad because I was out there when I left the house or to go see Jack I had my I put my flag out early in the morning of course when the sun comes up\nA and then I went to see jak are just some work for three hours and I went to see Jackson and came back to finish up my work at home and I took the flag down before I left 'cause it was really blowing I mean it was so windy and last time that happened like that or was it ended up in my driveway and snapped off the deck so I didn't want to go through that again so anyway so I feel bad that my play because not flying today 'cause I didn't I couldn't trust the weather\nAnd again play if it's if it's windy that's no problem if it's damaging when work and rip it off of your house holding section thing or housing or whatever\nAnd obviously don't do that you don't fly the flag at night without a light on it or in it and whether that's dangerous to the flag but if it's raining fly it ... it absolutely bad weather flight unless it's damaging the like like oh by the way I found that the luncheon menu for a ...\nAh was that they had dug Caprice salad and roast chicken\nAnd Jim Brown was there and who the hell else was there was somebody else and like I Can't believe I don't know this was Jim\nBrown and oh man I just can't free can believe that I'm trying to a friend who is in a ah\n... famous Jim Brown is with\nThe White House where there was somebody else to anyway a kind of us who made about ten minutes speech and it wouldn't do any duck whacking so [laughter]\n'cause I've cracked up or what I've lost it it's All right it's just it's gone up for twenty okay now this morning show your ... you know the last week\nThere's been a thing going on a ... year we're talking about a fellow they've nicknamed a ferret face who was complaining about the fact we had a big banner in our studio here at this radio station that has said Trump twenty twenty\nAnd apparent he was going around telling all the department you know they go from Senator or it's earlier someone doing theater he's gotten complaining about it so finally somebody made some complaints to HR HR went to corporate corporate said okay take down the sign\nSo we took down the sign and then there was a ... the uh the management at the at the top paid her team who despise and disrespect not only a radio station but this show in particular\nAnd I have turned our backs on us more than once over the last several years I can prove it with a billion things that would require my immediate resignation of us have take my word for it anyway and\nSo and so my complaint was the day it was some women who came through and they saw this I'm going to another radio station on the same for different a company and under our umbrella kill me let's put a different in radio station saw the sign of were offended by it and apparently one woman said it triggered ... memories of her being sexually abused\nAnd so my first I was you can't tell me that the name Trump\nA sexual abuse nightmares I mean I I just don't believe it I think this is all political to begin with and so the the the boss has made it made us take down the side then they come up with a memo saying well we don't\nAnd political science at work and we also want you to be nicer on social media because people can use social media against us and we'll have to be nicer with each other and that that I that I ... well that's nonsense that had nothing to do with it\nOr my complaint was that our bosses who have never supported us immediately uh clamp down on us rather than supporting us of the people who keep reminding her own business stuff their nose in our studio through the window to see where the Trump sign up there\nAnd you know a real man would have said hey wait a minute this is our radio station and they have the right to do what they want they like Britain is a Trump spreads in the United states what's wrong with that but because of that twenty twenty on it they can say oh it was all political and then this morning they were saying oh well we wouldn't even allow a Hillary for twenty twenty sign up there okay I accept that however\nThanks Charlie separate five man
