this first time I've ever thought you know station is absolutely the best stationed in the oil\nWill say or do we love this one yeah yeah\nOh yeah I enjoy all thing that I Try to take issue with is Louis olive oil on Jay but which Shelley only all kind of hoping that and that's an E S is\nKind of way like joy when it was yeah I feel like you know I'm not saying that whole right last spring he doesn't fit in because I I Believe he does try enjoy what they had no middle said yeah that was a young all may have different\nViews on especially like the Trump bat or stuff like that that may maybe something that you might get work out but you know kind of taking pot shots at ... at each other and I really haven't heard him so much take pot shots you other than I heard\nYou know [laughter] well [laughter] okay\nYeah all had said he said things by you know kind of like what you want to call me I'll tell you with that though that was what you said that he said that you know and that is that what he he he ... it was you know in a fight or something like he would he would be there to the zoo at a heartbeat\nYeah okay okay I clearly she and I appreciate your time is going to explain\nA the reason things like this happen is when Shelley says things like yeah he loves Bill Cosby and supports Bill Cosby and that oj I should never be considered guilty because he wasn't he wasn't found guilty or innocent you know we sort of asking for for us to respond to it and so and then when we do then you know then I'm an old a geriatric\nWeiner or something so I it's just you know it's all just goofy stuff in fact I'll tell you this uh tomorrow when he's on six nine chilly winter six tonight\nAnd tomorrow late in the show I think around quarter nine but I uh somewhere around there he's going to have a one of our uh uh one of their big boss is on the on his show tomorrow to talk about this all Trump banner business\nSo that may be it may be a phone conversation to take part of and then and if if you're available listen to that tomorrow morning I think between eight thirty nine with Shelley and then uh and then there are I'm sure Shannon and are both I maybe might have something to say about it and uh it it's no big deal it's fine there's you know it's a\nAny family has problems and and uh you know brothers who have spats every once in a while and stuff like that but we are still a family and uh\nOh it's like you know he could we can make fun of everybody else but if they want to make fun of them are all sticking together so I wouldn't worry too much but um you know it's just radio and just you know people were all we're all high energy people were all\nA sort of people were all you know active type one personality type a personalities and so you're going to get these things so I I I wouldn't be too worried about it I think\nOne thing is is I don't see nothing happened to which I mean I don't have no say so but I Do listen all I mean literally all day long was\nGoing on in the truck all day last what we what have\nI absolutely love you guys and\nYou know I mean you know sometimes it's funny but sometimes you can call to allow a little bit and just because he may say things like with the bill Cosby's stuff and the other thing that's just the difference of opinion but the late ... opinion to me\nThat's kind of like saying overboard but I mean that's just yeah well I'm a different opinion about something but I'm never make fun of European\n[laughter] well I keep place in it for fun you know I mean I I Want you to have me manners Mike I'm we can start\nWhile they'll hear the whole I didn't say I don't get it we should go Hyman a good mood I don't understand that I was in a great movie this morning I went over and talk to my new paid maybe
