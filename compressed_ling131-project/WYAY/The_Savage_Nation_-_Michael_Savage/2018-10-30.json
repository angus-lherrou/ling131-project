my story Shaun\nWhite is Shaun White is that a a a red haired carrot top skateboard a Olympic ... there's no ... no snowboard snowboarder and he's one like every metal and he's one Olympic like they set up you know because the great for famous for their snowboarding individual events snowboarding\nAnyway he's ... he's at red haired guy and he went to all the he's very famous Shaun White\nHe went to a costume party dressed as simple\nJak simple jak\nIs the character from the movie Tropic Thunder which came out uh ten years ago and when it did a Ben Stiller and the movie Tropic Thunder had a character called simple jak who was intellectually disabled and they referred to and repeatedly as the R word\nIn the movie ten years ago simple jak retarded if he was which is not the word we use but that's what they said it'll actually disabled challenge a lot of different words they use for it so jazz Shaun White went through a a costume party a Halloween party dressed as simple jak and their facial expression like he didn't know enough to pound sand I mean it's really offensive\nAnd now I mean there's so he thinks that what is going to be okay the Special Olympics\nSaid we're truly disappointed that just cleaned Olympian would choose this constant which is so offensive and causes so much pain disability is not a joke nor should it be a punchline we hope Shaun White and others learn discontinued stigma stereotypes and discrimination that you learn from it\nUh and some people say I'm not sure if it's worse than to natural movie out there you think it's okay to my people who have disabilities and somebody said Europe EOS man at the expense of those who can't defend themselves when he said I Hope you're working on your lame apologies speech [laughter] got to wait for that to come out\nI mean that's idiotic or for twenty nine and uh did you hear in fact speaking of Halloween costumes you know uh what's her name Megan Kelly just got booted off of NBC for talking even talking about the issue of blackface and Bill Maher talking about Halloween is trying to call out the leftist hypocrites\nAnd then there's the trap we walk into every\nYear now I personally don't care if you go trick or treating\nDressed as point oh one percent of Elizabeth Warren [noise] but the office of scolding justice warriors has decreed no hula girls know Indian chief snow southern belles no Daniel Boone ... ninjas gypsies mobsters terrorists\nThe Handmaid's tale customers already been pulled from the shelves but an apology issued less someone be offended by the ironic take on a character that doesn't exist from a fictional world that never happens [laughter]\n\nA character that doesn't exist from a fictional world that never happened I mean that's perfect\nEven the liberals but he's even turn it on his liberal [noise]\n[noise] not everything that merely alludes to another culture is racist or cultural appropriation bank you really\nHalloween was always fun to guess it wasn't PC not being PC is almost the whole point of the holiday\nBut now everything has to turn into a federal case of snowflakes versus humor the majority of America is with the Democrats on the issues they just find it'll woke people irritating as hell\nDoes any money remember when conservative is with the ones with the sticks up there\nWe went from yes we can do oh no you didn't\nBy the way you ... what's the business on this walk or were you when you've been walks\nAnd well which means you suddenly have are aware of the discrimination but it is this\nYour is this sanctimonious and everybody else now are you raise your self above the rabble out and you can judge them now you know because you're whoa man\nNot even use the orange way I always think of today but what it would possibly\nI mean I'm trying to think back when I was a kid which is one Halloween was fine when it was fun to me is when I was a kid and also when I was adult with young kids there's really nothing much nothing much more fun at this time of year when it gets cold and dark and usually raining on Halloween\nFor parents to go walk around the neighborhood where they're little kids dressed in costumes getting trick or treat candy and you talk to your neighbors and you're watching the kids and it's just it's just like a street party is fun and it's happy and everybody's happy and I'm In a ... I remember you know if you have a six year old white boy\nWho's wearing a ... any huge book big black bushy moustache a and going as a a\nFight or something I ... I mean that's not that doesn't mean he's picking on Mexican it's funny you see a six year old white boy with a moustache it's almost as big as he isn't a big some barrel head it's funny\nIt's ... it's not me and it's just funny you would hope it is Halloween you mean why would you dress up if you weren't pretending to be somebody else\nThen what's the point let me just just wear your street\nClosely glass for candy hold him on the dressing on the first place was to scare away the bat right\nYeah many people have forgotten everything about it it's a fun holiday it's you know it doesn't mean you have to be a which it doesn't mean you have to hate everybody if you dress like another somebody from another cultures the dumbest thing I've ever heard some people to shut up behind their own thing and now here's the other thing let's say you're a parent\nAnd you're out with a bunch of kids maybe or maybe your son's dress like a you know just like a one thousandth of a percent of an Indian however we could get you know they're going to come out and you get to somebody's door you knock on the door and the answer the door and they said oh I'm I'm ...

speak to see how much they're bashing Donald Trump and the least up it's now even in the Gulf and gives you this is from golf digest from this this this month or two over twenty in golf digest they're doing an interview with this guy had Suzie a famous golf course designer he's wanted to design the Olympic a Gulf venue in Brazil or was\nAnd uh and he's very famous and he's built a bunch of things that everybody is talking about you know it's fun to get on the site he talks about being there and the bulldozers and you want to make it simple doubts about that all the latest with things the government didn't environment every and then here's here's one of his paragraphs\nAnd the middle of the golf digest article here's one of the paragraphs\nI've ... I've seen people screw up their faces and asked why would you ever want to work for Donald Trump my answer is always at the time why at the time why wouldn't\nI I my experiences with it began before his run for president they were all positive I saw a man focused on Gulf War the financial wherewithal to make it happen you can't ask for more than that it was never complicated it was a big help\nAnyway he had to get in the fact that people go up to me as an architect for golf courses and say how how did you work for Donald Trump a golf course architect\nI mean is it I cried and it's everywhere and by the way you know the the things that ... that they hate Donald Trump for are the things that he did what twelve years ago or something I mean he had you know he wasn't having assigned to me in the oval office like a natural sitting president was for eight years\nYou know oh man there's really no ... it's just they don't like him but it does that doesn't mean you shouldn't support what he does is president of their ... law\nBut it can you ... you should be grateful house in ... in fact Hillary and I was talking about running again in fact\nThey asked her on ... and they said or Mrs Clinton how you're going to run for president she said would you agree with what you do get a run for president twenty twenty she said no no but I like to\nBe president so should still in there she got she pointed or ... I don't think she deserved she still thinks she should be the first female president\nAnd it was incredible incredible because he had her granddaughter on the show with her and when she got the granddaughter got in Hillary Rodham piece to get far cabbage is lap and said gee grandma first you said you wanted to be a ... a president and then you said you weren't going to run show or what's the difference in that\nReally turned on her granddaughter [laughter] they're a TV\nA U.S wages fell Sherry I think sharing surely Sherry\n...\nHere we go\nI Would do how about a little ... twenty eight twenty Oh thank you hanging a [laughter] while you're ready for revenge though a blonde is watching the news with her husband the newscaster says six Brazilian men die in the sky diving accident\nThe blonde starts sobbing her husband looking at her she says oh that's horrible that's horrible and the husband confuses yesteryear it's sad but they were sky diving and there's always that risk involved after a few minutes the blonde still sobbing says yeah but how many is a Brazilian\nSix [laughter]\nSorry [laughter] I Do\nNot want to ah they're sure all the new talk what six seven hello Cheryl how's it going\nOn Sunday thank you so much for taking my call love the show they really wanted to say I know you're talking about uh you know Trump can't do anything right and ... and all that good stuff yeah it's my opinion\nBut they want us all they want everyone to leave their in their head and the Trump is doing horrible and make sure they stay mad at him with all the lights and everything they put in the media because he ... he said he was ... yeah which is the opposite of what they want to have them\nOn he showing out everything that the previous administration did again American against American that they hated and the previous administration dealing and getting away with\nCalling them now starting to get where they can prosecute then and it's a long as I can hear every one friday and away from me that they can keep their boat on human glow causing trouble riots and all this other stuff to keep the attention away from what he's actually getting which is nothing but good for the country\nAnd our American people you know they can get him out and not let him any more people elected in or um any more people that can help him initially he started and they can try to get a grip on what they want to do this country all over again and then we'll just all screwed\nUp through the surely you're right and and and by the way I think that again this goes back to a basic philosophy and hurt someone talking about this a year ago and I can't remember who it was right give them full credit but it seems and I totally agree with it seems to me the Donald Trump what's happening in Washington and around the country now it spreads so much what's happening now is it is it's the old fashioned\nA status quo system is trying to belch out Donald Trump the system doesn't want an outsider like Donald Trump who's not taken wrap up anybody\nHe moved to sit at the headquarters of the er the Jewish people to Jerusalem east on what he did get killed the ... Iran nuclear deal used on every he's kept all of his campaign promises so far working on the wall\nAnd they can't stand it and it's the system it's time to try and do regurgitate them out they they are trying to kick them out there trying to show that we don't like outsiders anymore but he's done more as an outsider in a year and a half a little less than two years\nWe've been up what he did for eight and he's just keeping us dramas and they can't stand it it's just so wrong Sheryl I'm Glad you called for thirty five oh is that the hold on to that and it looks like your news regular line is the audio dues regular line or good afternoon\nCan reduce the speed it quite that made or are you doing man what's around you know certainly\nShould legalization of marijuana in Colorado and member of auto accident is really increased champion has increased a lot has good news is none of the drivers were doing what a ten miles\nAn hour [laughter]\nHey when in doubt Jack Potter Wednesday and I don't want it to ... million yeah well I Want to play the odds of being a performance Cherokee contract\n[laughter]\nNo actually yesterday for a while and I make an ancient traditional ...
