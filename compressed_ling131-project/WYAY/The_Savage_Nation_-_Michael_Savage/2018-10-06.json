[laughter]\nYou have so much [noise] holy fantastic busy you are listening to the commercial replay\nPolo to boom we'd go here and you're listening to a replay of the cameras show became or won't be holding anything out of his head no it'll be much lower ...\nThis was Dr phil [laughter] hey dial here's your home with a man who actually believe management when they told him that he had his back was how do you think your is\nThe gym or\nA new talk one oh six seven like I'll\nGive you the number here eight for for for all for ten sixty seven one zero six seven eight for for for all for ten sixty\nSeven Ramon was on\nThis day Nineteen eighty three reminds guitarists Johnny Ramon is headed for our brain surgery operation after somebody found unconscious at a street in New York or even had the crap kicked out on a street fight\nSo he went home and he has a final wish for when he dies he's eleven and he's making final wishes\nEleven year old Caleb Hammond wants people to send him racing stickers\nHe's loved auto racing since he was two years old killed his passion is what prompted the request for stickers and his uncle says the stickers have been pouring in after social media appeal is trying to keep everybody spirits up\nUh he's been home for about three weeks now and he does what other eleven year old kids do as much as you can but then he gets tired released Lee and he's hoping to get some racing stickers to cover his casket when he dies\nThat's what the eleven year old boy says he wants to racing's tickets are stickers to cover his casket when he died from leukemia God what a heartbreaking story that is\nAnd how about some good news it's also has a little sad in some ways to have you seen the video of the reunions of families in North and South Korea holy smokes a Donald Trump by the way is getting full credit for this\nHe arranged between the presidents of north and South Korea to get together to make a deal so that families who were separated during the Korean War are finally getting a chance to meet relatives who were separated from them fifty sixty years ago\nAnd there was video of of of of families women who are in their Seventy five eighty year old range seeing their brothers and sisters for the first time since they were for me and there I mean that's\nWhat will they now have more than one surname ... [laughter]\nWell I think they're all the same name still but can you imagine I mean the videos really is it's really astounding there you know they haven't seen family in sixty years Berlin Wall stuff God\nI mean can you ... and and here's the here's the kicker like the the sad part about it is that apparently they were given a Donald Trump arranged the meeting to have them get the reunion together but apparently the deal is they are they can meet together in the same spot for three days\nBut they're being limited to only talk with each other actually sit together with each other over the three days for a total of\nEleven hours and the reason for that is the north Koreans don't want their people to find out too much about how good it is in South Korea are afraid they'll defect or tried to defect but again there at least getting to see the relatives of the first time since Nineteen fifty\nOr even before that when they were separated before the war [noise] pointed spell oh man I don't\nThink I'm standing on your [laughter] [laughter]\nOh pi Justin ...
