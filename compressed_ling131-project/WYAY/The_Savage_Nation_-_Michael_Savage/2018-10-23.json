point there if you let seven thousand then next week it's twenty thousand kids got to keep going ... to ... once again I keep delivering here\nUh last week we made we made the point that Donald Trump cow town he gave in to the Democrats when he stopped separating children from families who are arrested at the border that's we're putting did for eight years Trump doesn't want you to get in trouble so we caves and so we said okay no more separating families at the border I guess what\nIn September there was a record number of families arrested at the border Seventeen thousand arrested at the border I'll record because he was no longer separating the families and that is a cattle call for anybody else disease not separating families anymore yeah I uh\nAnd the audience free sort of a gun

just a put a appalling\nAnd it's a publicity stunt by the Democrats to make Republicans look bad stomach Donald Trump do something they can use in the election that's all this that's why I was but that's what it was planned out right before the election it wasn't playing last summer or in the spring we plan right now this is now the Democrats publicity stunt\nTo blame Donald Trump they wanted to do something horrible to those people right before the election\nThey wanted to send the national guard and you know shoe rubber bullets or bean bag guns or something or tear gas and they want to have it all over the world on the video so that they can say look out Donald Trump is treating the poorest people in the world America turning their back on those who need help\nIt's a stunt it's all
