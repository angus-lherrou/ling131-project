what we talk about it in our office will be a duly elected president\nMakes me now what's\nWhat's a ... ... talk about here quickly stepped up to bat down that are not Mitch McConnell here\n\nWe are that judge Kavanaugh was supposedly responsible for a sexual assault on a boat in Newport Rhode Island until the accuser every kind of the story completely but not before\nMany on the media has gone eating it up\nBut way people live out the\nDemocrats mishandling of Dr Ford Motor open the floodgates for this deluge of uncorroborated unbelievable mug\nYour mother would have slap you in the pages that oh shut up and go out and play\nLike it I mean he I mean my God my parents were to look at me like what is the matter with you [laughter]\nMe God\nAnyway well look I mean we've been told it's we're doing what I'm saying that she had said come just stuff like this\nDo not have the right to never be offended\nI don't know what's happened to all of a sudden people is social media I Know exactly which I'd social media everybody now has the right to react to everything this none of their business and you ... and the problem is that you feel obligated by the beginning clean again that that thing over there it's time for the\nDaily attack that's best there's your bed she right here I went to this man is really\nRadio here [noise] [noise] okay [noise]\nEight ... sixty seven ... coming up here [laughter] we'll talk about this business with a non policy policy\nAbout hate talking and show the\nThe funding to send the hypocrisy and why this is such a joke I mean it is embarrassing honestly there it's a hundred and eighty degrees wrong\nMy opinion and I'll tell you about that in a minute a hate speech at Georgetown Law professor white men are targets not by the way since wondering why all of a sudden it's white men why did appear that it's white men on the committee they were elected\nTo people that have been their stake elected them so that's who you deal with\nBut if they're white men now what all of a sudden now which is the target against white man is now in the in the cabinet and hearing because they're white men my God where as opposed to what no more white men will you'll hear what this professors that somebody would joke at Georgetown have hate speech like this calling for violence I mean vicious pilots\nUh and by that would turn it around it if if this had been a case where this Grover a female professor was talking about black men being castrated and said to the swine\nCan you imagine also you're gonna hear Donald Trump taking another snotty female reporter and the media claims that he insulted her she insulted the president can you imagine well just for real quick second uh where here we go she shocked\nThat I picked her I'm just a little bit of this in the state of shock I'm not thinking that that's okay I Know you're not thinking you never do I'm Sorry no go ahead actually\nHe thought she said I'm not thinking and she actually said I'm not thinking you or something and he said oh I Know you and everything you said what so there was a big issue on whether she was saying I'm not thinking you suppose I'm not thinking Trump said sheets Trump thought she set out what you're not thinking now and the White House had to change the transcript of the of this dialogue\nThat's why I mentioned it she was so ... not eat him and then they complain that he insulted her absolutely back a hundred and eighty degrees backwards and if that had been Heather uh what's her name from a Fox News had their shoulders talking to ... and ... and ... and she had done with this girl does to Trump man they would've lynched her\nBut talking about them at at uh let's see suite next bat guano nut job this ... wants to be a baby killer and Kate Snow from NBC breathless e asking her about the gang rapes of Brett Kavanaugh and I welcome you didn't ask one question I Would have asked right off the bat an excuse me ... in other words you're telling me that you went to ten gang rape parties\nOkay you went to a gang rape party then you went to a second gang rape party then you went to a third\nGang rape party during this is going to want to force gang rape she went to ten gang rape parties before she was finally gang raped and I guess you didn't go to any after that\nFinally they got around to her well how ugly wishy back then I mean what a joke she went to ten gang rape parties didn't anybody maybe see a honey why are you going to the see that's what they're doing I've been talking about credibility\nMy God we talked earlier that's like you and I going to college and we watch some guy Cornel [laughter] yeah [laughter] same time right\nAnd you would have to bring anything or just going to now sees [laughter] I mean come on asked the question I mean really hungry and in my life [laughter]\nWhy would you go to Ken gang rape parties\nEleven didn't have always been invited to the last one [laughter] geez Alan\nDershowitz calls out the forties we'll talk about that too but what I really admire the heck out of this guy because after a liberal he's he's he's one of the most honest decent men I've ever heard talk about ... and he's a screaming liberal but he's he's a real American anyway and the funny cover up of the Keith Ellison business to\nA well you've got all that kind of stuff I thrill three others do oh hold on the news ... coming up and also Martin I Want to get your call and we'll talk about this non policy policy where we're supposed to be a lot nicer to people and where do you hear some of the ah social media I'm going to read from the big bosses to show how they really not never followed their own policy putting on policy\nHold on there is a news regularly because he was on the news regularly or good afternoon\nCameras rose in housing that's very Rosie Rosie no no it's that's where all good right now without that the\nSenate ... survive that big a memo and everything you know policy I held off because I wanted to make sure if the trans matter where it's where I Am [laughter]\nSo that's why I mean sure the people on social media so it's like they are when they reach rate total lies about judge cabin on his family had a chance to weigh in Baghdad where they're not really no [laughter]\nThan it\nFace to face to face trial and then it makes my management that's more than ... ...\n...

I Love my work and flag and the honor of anyway um but uh [noise] what the heck was ... and here this morning I learned a few things listening to the show one he is given a nickname ferret face to the guy who's the guy who's apparently behind all this stuff [noise]\nI also learned a couple of things did you know\nListening to the to the ...\nOr the ... also this is a true story ... ... years after high school he's in high school let's let's say Twenty years later he's ... he's talking with a bunch of friends including two girls in the group of friends he's talking with and we'll see what girl a and grail B so he's talking a girl and he says well I remember girl a member when we made a lot back in high school\nAnd she says that wasn't me you idiot it was my friend over here [laughter]\nAnd I swear to God I'm not saying they're both of them that wasn't me you're memorize\nIt was her that was me and my God Burt oh can you imagine if you get and there are certain votes right there oh\nOh yeah yeah no I remember no yeah that's a man and he pulled it off you know I guess there's still good friends that everything's fine you know people that you mentioned it to see [laughter] and I also found out\nRecently that apparently care thinks or find her father and brother are really hot I'm just saying I don't have a comment on that I'm just saying I learned that I just learned doesn't show\nI hold I was getting mark and we're talking about this a non policy policy Martin things rolling on a radio man what's up\nYes sir are two things the girl politically or whatever and you know yeah\nNow the talk on the rodeos house sounds like a baby a status as she doesn't know how to express herself with all the degrees inside all\nThe way that you're about that but anyway the point\nIs it would be fun to hear a a audio of public speaking which she apparently has done quite a bit of a somebody could take that up\nIn jail for ... yeah that would be a ... yeah and the Feinstein a heavily dug up anything on the culpability of holding those documents or\nBe a little bit nicer well which ... and ... and what a bunch of hypocrites I I you have no idea of the kind of vicious filth that came out of our top management team and now they're telling us to be nice on social\nMedia we're supposed to be something that raises a little something are on TALK radio and maybe if you guys up in the top officers would spend a little money on promotion and marketing maybe somebody around town and find out that hey what you know we got stuff on the radio that might be interesting to listen to once\nIn awhile but they're not going to do that to live the way we can make waves on our own if you're not going to help us yeah I Can't complain we're doing it all by ourselves away my God yeah move over your frequent blocking us God\nYou know they throw under the bus and you know they they said back beef or something I didn't do ... and maybe ... a sheet of why we did the same thing to hang up and threw him under the bus\nThe cover the rats and now somebody complained HR in corporate so he said oh God I've got to come up with a policy just show that I've handled this you guys I really handled this and so they come up with this nine policy policy\nPlease take care of what you hang in your studio your cubicle or your office to the extent possible let's keep our opposite environment that is free of heart held stance is an advocacy on issues more than anything much appreciate each other let's welcome different opinions but always always do it with love and respect\nShe that doesn't sound like love and respect calling Donald Trump of Nazi and a womanizer in a liar and stupid or seeing Republicans both for Kavanaugh because they don't care that the girls telling the truth\nThat's our top team and they're telling us to be nice\n\nTelling us to be nice it's exactly the opposite we should be saying who the hell do you think you are when these women a ... and by the way a senator Purdue from Georgia is going to cost to the other ... yesterday by women you know is that don't you turn your back on me and how could you not respect women and so and so forth it's time to say shut up lady you're\nOn the line I mean it's just outrageous\nWho the hell do you think you were going backwards we don't want to be you know we don't want to be nicer and sweeter and inclusive my God that's where you tried for two hours sitting there for two years in the afternoon and it was a disaster just like I warn you would be a disaster I said quote they'll kill him\nAnd you try to you want to be softer to more inclusive it doesn't work here and that's not what we do\nIt's not our job\nCuts exactly a hundred eighty degrees were wrong if he'd been wrong since before since they got here [laughter]\nReally I mean we were here three years before they showed up and they've been wrong every single time every single time\nI mean not even close Air America oh my God they used to

I\nI'm ... management does not want us on the air when they ... they got rid of that tried to get rid of a they got rid of ... went to all news outlets sure fire hit\nWith not it was it was uttered\nHuh that's ... ... talk it up in Britain you're like well you and and and you know you're a landmark status citizen or a ... a except for the call original\nBut [laughter] but that was\nThe end of the fire Burn Notice the\nRecord book leader with a whole bunch of lives down the ... the ... they don't want coal they don't they don't they don't like conservative people don't want ... who is making such a who's who you just cannot say all the supplies here\nWell I I guess you know I don't hold it against them because that's all they know these guys aren't talk people they're not talk radio people they're not conservatives are not conservative talk radio people so you know they're rock and rollers ... so I got a job\nBut ... says the sooner we can do their job ... or less just on line yeah your job but we have to be nice you Mr Rogers online that's yeah\nIt's nonsense I'm Still\nIt's based on some of those files stuff I've ever been written on his on his litter\nOh it it's brutal and they were blasting Donald Trump called them everything but a ham sandwich for a year and a half a and is it just and you're making fun of the Capitol hearing seeing the girls obviously he's a liar and she they don't believe the women is I mean this is\nFrom the top guys so but again you know they just ... it's it's\nIt's as if that's all they know this but what kills me is they keep making decisions that are absolutely wrong there are a hundred and eighty degrees exactly opposite we usually take saying we should have a billboard you says All right ladies have you really feel that way about it and we need to talk about this once and for all or you know stop calling his name\nFor the man round here well how do you like taking my mailman for what I mean my God stand up for what's right in America stand up for Trump his stand up for the man and the thing there you know yeah there's\nAll these divides that were there and you know I really well I I think that there really is a a a just a to a concerted effort to silence conservative voices I'll just like the other big picnic looks like a Facebook and apple that Google was split it probably sounds concern is I Believe that our companies opposite side of the same thing\nUm ... what else do that\nYeah that would leave and what what makes it worse in my opinion is not that they would be trying to silence us but they're trying to silence is because they're afraid to take on the heat they're afraid to stand up the people are like the uh like like the one person in a in a market did did it does something that causes a problem\nInstead of standing up for the people at the radio station they're afraid to take on anybody who has a criticism about someone in a in a in a controversial talk show which is by God by definition what we do and God Forbid somebody react negatively to it and you're afraid to take it out and they won't support is they won't back us up they're afraid of the controversy they're afraid of somebody saying something\nBad so the cowardly out the chicken out and say let's say will be a little sweeter nicer and so that's going to work and my God I mean it's just idiocy\nYeah the fact that the response here a ... or ...\nGrand ...\nOutside of their response or who to trust that I'm a bit of a southern us in Studio yeah and they said okay what's the offensive was what is it a giants\nYes when we finally put to to put the two and two together are realizing the words that she was using the descriptions that she was using as it relates to our son yeah and then we finally went
