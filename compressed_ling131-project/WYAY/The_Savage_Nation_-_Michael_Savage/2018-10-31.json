were talking yesterday about the uh the synagogue massacre what tell the people for one of the first things you said when we were talking about it about the ... there was a massacre at a synagogue so the first thing you thought of\nHere's the obligatory AJC three times a year at temple bombing sample bombing story and son of a gun this morning I brought it in for ... just a glove his only in the AJC synagogue mass care and then as the big headline Nineteen fifty eight temple bombing column still\nRelevant and they are they showed an old article from Nineteen fifty eight Jewish temple and Peachtree wrecked by dynamite blast\nAnd they're you know Ralph McGill a about ... the longtime editor about the bombing in Nineteen fifty eight and ... it's a big long story once again and I tell you\nThese free canoe and find a way that the AJC has got to be almost on his last legs this Saturday morning paper it's about eight pages I mean it's literally like it's eight or nine pages and most of its just wire service stuff and\nYou know and and in lynching\nAlmost ... almost every Sunday there is a lynching story in the paper where is that people can laugh at you know it's old old history stuff oh history lynching not gotten modern lynching\nAnd it wasn't just remind us that we used to be willing to see if it wasn't for the temple bombing rank and Emmett Till right they have nothing to ride I just had another series on him and tell them the longest [laughter]\nYou better not get over it Mr oh we have a new song\nI I'd say well we gotta we gotta new a new regulator coming in a second

have talked about it right before the election when all the\nPeople who are concerned but it just made another issue out of four against him anyway he's going to talk about that even though most of the so called experts are saying he probably does not have the right to just\nFill out an executive order you can do it but it may not stand up and probably is not going to stand up but still you but but and that's that thing was so stupid because it's not going to work it sound like you can do it tomorrow\nSo if you can't do it then why even talking about in something so flamboyant that it's like all the costs you pull it would just seem like pretty stupid thing to me and also coming up here in a second we got the news magazine and the second also coming up\nRobert Mueller says ah some

countries don't they understand that it's a tax dollars that are going to pay for those people right hold\nOn the street but I'll agree American children that we want to take it for a national what is their problem\nWell the problem is that they do they do what they do based on feelings and who doesn't feel sorry you're looking at the video last night of the of these migrants coming up my ... it was nice video last night obviously and they're they're sleeping on the street they're sleeping in parking lots of sleeping in gas stations on the\nGround I mean there's no place for the kids are

lot\nI mean what my God you of course you feel sorry for me feel bad for them to during the situation with their children how can how can you look at that video and not feel bad for those kids the children you're dragging along for their political purposes\nAnd yet we can't base a country based on our feelings and how badly we feel for other people who want to come here you just can't operate that way you don't mind\nThe right the right thing to do here is the ... order food water than to write that well they\nYeah and and I think Trump's idea and Thanks Tony is to put up tents wouldn't have been able to get her they're not ... you know they can we can just let them wander in and and yet we have to process and that's that's the catch twenty two we're going to get screwed no matter
