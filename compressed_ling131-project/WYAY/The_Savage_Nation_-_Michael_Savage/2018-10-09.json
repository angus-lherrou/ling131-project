laying on the ground still throwing their their his effect if Hillary would've on can you imagine the two people she would have put on the court and they would have been just so fun with that\nWay so that's why a Bill Clinton had the secret tarmac meeting with a Loretta Lynch because she was going to be named to the Supreme Court when Hillary won the election\nWhile that's even scarier exact about I'm sure that's true that's why they had that secret meeting and they got caught by the media and of course nothing ever happened because of it she got away with\nWhat the two people he put on couldn't be better examples of exactly what you want on the Supreme Court people that are interpret the constitution the way it was written yeah and I am worried you know I think people have forgotten about ... the way they are staring up these crazies I think we're going to have another skull essentially that here in the next few months just they've lost their mind\nThey have lost their minds I ... and again this is not the Democratic party of in America I've never seen\nI've never seen the Democratic party act like this this this disease weirdo outside leaders and and the problem is you

you know Nancy find people cheat\nStain it looks like she's like a deer in headlights and all of a sudden she got caught being a scoundrel at trying to convince the committee not developed by hiding
