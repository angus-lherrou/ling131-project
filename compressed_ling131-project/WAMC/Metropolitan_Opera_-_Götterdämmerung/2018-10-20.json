Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a veteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe on the field Harry inside already to me right in terms of who who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in a pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that fair\nIt is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restrain President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a fire in various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference from the twenty sixteen election\nThat's a report that it's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court and appeals court levels all over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nIt take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller um McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible\nUh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending trumped nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood he has been\nHandling much of the solar met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nI Do want to ask you though about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency but\nIf he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stop in the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that ambiguity which has really been with us for a very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity ... speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution and the tradition of the office or to the humans who have held the office where it is one in the other begin drawing that lunch never been easy but it's never been more important\nAlright well thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches that that identity headlines that we may have missed because of all the other news it's been happening think Iraq\n[noise]\n\n\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ...

H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here and we'll start with you can you just lay of the land start with the basic the who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nAnd won support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that\nHe's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director of national security council\nAnd Joe you been there on the ground in the district so touch with a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so\nMacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it took a little bit more detail about who lives in his district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kind of goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out\nThat way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nTo the Republican and the rates MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter than that I mean given equal talked with a little bit about why Democrats see this as a potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you tell MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort and this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that\nGoes in general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about healthcare\nA lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacked\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nJersey third congressional district is it's kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurance to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip from twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it\nIn their favor as the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those were pro eight CIA and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nOr a line that we might not have heard say four years ago it's amazing to see Republicans on their back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place that

him and unnamed people inside the consulate NPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman they note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings pretend days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day 'cause showed you arrived at the consulate\nThere are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump said he found that Saturday account of what happened

office today to uh Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times Mr Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby it's Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss\nThank you so much for having me now I I have to ask do you think that race with a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds on it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described at six foot three and three hundred pounds of sort of those those are factual detail though aren't they I mean if you were to someone you wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have ... do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported but your brother struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in that says well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection holiday so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think the ... and I think I Know statistics show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person has a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public

when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course amplifying that is that the officer is white and a deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post there had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he

that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a
