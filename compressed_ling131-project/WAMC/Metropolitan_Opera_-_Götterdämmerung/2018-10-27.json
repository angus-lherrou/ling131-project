representatives\nThat we have NPR's Dominican to narrow Tim Mak an Danielle Kurtzleben in the studio everybody hey so let's start with the fact that historically and given some of the big picture trends Democrats really do have to wind up their backs let's walk through why exactly that is\nWhen president during their first midterms they lose a heck of a lot of seats on average is just as a matter of and we've heard President Trump actually posit publicly why that is\nNot a good job wise [noise]\nIn some of it has to do with frankly with the fact that people got their guy over the line they got their president and then they sort of a back off and the willingness perhaps the content that settles in and the people who are most motivated or the people who are most upset with the policies of the new president is putting in place\nFun facts on that so Gallup crunched the numbers a little bit earlier this year and they found that when the president's approval rating going into the midterms is below fifty percent and Trump's according to our latest poll is thirty nine percent\nThe president's party averages a loss of thirty seven seats in the house which by the way Democrats need fewer than that in order to take the house so when the president has approval of over fifty percent his party tend to lose only fourteen ... still a lot but not nearly as huge\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression or who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\nKevin Abrams has sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the election comes closer more specifically one issue that drawing a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registrations that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nAnd this has drawn a federal lawsuit a camp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams end of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as complex to point out\nBut the issue has really persisted for a long time it continued to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty ...\nKaren education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not\nTotally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently that looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning of the Georgia flag back in the nineties that at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nThe ... this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell Georgia is one of the state that has been traditionally Republican but there have been sign that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal but ... has done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nStates have room to be spending tax rating liberal she kind of extreme [noise] even campaign\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there Abrams I'm not sure has done the same with camp and so my big question is you know Abrams talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe a more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand and he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams hello to climb if she's going to win this race\nOr we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

weekend through the mid term elections to guide you through everything you need to know what the elections disclose people are focusing\nOn the whole to try to get a sense of what might happen on election day just about a week from ... showing Gillum was one point lead well within the margin of error real clear politics however has\nIt at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and neck is this the race to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and if you weren't sure already confirmed this\nThis election is all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only when we're winning I don't like them otherwise\nJoining me now to talk through this with NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben either hey All right\nSo about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans this new polls this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nWell it looks like essentially that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republican has kind of faded to be perfectly honest or it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example\nThe vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pool and the numbers a Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in people's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November ...\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nAs a twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around and say that they're motivated to go vote for a Democrat because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for\nA Republican so I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this is about me get trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this is a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking to you though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corner Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gap\nMore likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote you have fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide then you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for Democrats thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this is important that here\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential to hear across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic ... democratic win and I'll like this like Trump and are going to vote Democrat\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks that independence they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and the gamble here among Republicans in a lot of Republicans I talked to was they said look independents young voters Latino\nA new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nAnd that's at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this was the the rare period where where both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together people saying look what we need here as a tobacco up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just\nDitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can\nIf we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's at least do that that is NPR's Ron

each week we focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law racism\n[noise] health care for my first day I'm going to ask God to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare [noise]\nWith the Democrat has to be Affordable Care act Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing\nAnd replacing it we're going to keep our promises that goal\nThey used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing and we're going to keep our promises\nThat does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act how fast harsher a tale of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one\nNow is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it\nThat has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this with NPR's Scott Horsley Danielle Kurtzleben guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the healthcare as their best\nIssue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned fair minimum but if you're a Democrat you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the healthcare system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ad throughout the entire midterm cycle then Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for affordable accessible health care and not take it away\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota and he has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now the retina match with Morsi's losses to take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily wiggling away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have had tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or have tried to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ad\nComes down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with action taken by the Trump Administration\nGot what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people a book could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a healthcare marketplace is\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a marketplaces and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the a C a insurance marketplace which despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was folks\nYou still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate build it didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built the bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative so and so voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace bill that bill would have done away with your protection for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks\nIn an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nThat's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will crack wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions moving the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year how democratic ad yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks these things here to tell them building Democrats field is here that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nAt the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nTwo of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying oh I definitely would protect\nPeople with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease preexisting conditions we know what that's like ... I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre existing conditions\nSupport comes from the New York state health department reminding overseas travelers they're a measles outbreaks in many parts of the world including Europe\nVaccines that should be updated before traveling health dot and why that G.

have hurt other colleagues from NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections ... ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties\nWe decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of that and blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to its content that Democrats thought what secure the White House for them and all of the states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house\nSo we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what to and they're on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we asked WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookie insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and now let's say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of estate mean for the last six years Pennsylvania's have had congressional maps\nThat were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis will challenge last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not in federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map and unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific theme in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know she'll just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaign in the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but\nWas also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick he's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists name Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary are not just the policies that are being\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my

never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and\nAll very negative [laughter] what do you think is the ledge fan of it here the on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that\nTies all of us together as money in politics\nMy opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime he's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money in this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting\nClean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control the amount of money that\nFlows in from the big corporate special interests stops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district ... expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that's how the candidate votes\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understand this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voices going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in\nYour campaign it is huge I mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone\nSo he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in part a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging\nHe goes around the country singer vote for blank vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election and of course interest is much higher on the president's election and the reality is this is the first chance to voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing\nAnd the last thing I think anybody wants to see is Trump doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me
