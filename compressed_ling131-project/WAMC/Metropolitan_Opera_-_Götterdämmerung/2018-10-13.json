disaster mental health about the human toll of the event\nDr Carl ... is an associate professor in the psychology department and ... and the deputy director of the Institute for disaster mental health she's also the director of the advance certificate program and trauma and disaster mental health but at the school\nShe says the first responders in school Harry county many of whom are volunteers may not be ready to handle the trauma of the accident as opposed to perhaps in the state police and responders or larger urban areas who brings drama and multiple fatalities more often\nThis is definitely a population that I Would be concerned about and hope for getting the support that they need um you know people\nBecome volunteer firefighters or antifa because they think they can handle it because they have a high tolerance because they are strong and resilient but certainly anyone can reach a breaking point and I'm sure what they encountered\nAt the scene would be a breaking point for just about anyone um and there's also often with this population is often kind of an added level of\nGuilt because you know they're there to save people in when they're unable to do that even if that clearly would have been impossible that often kind of factors in as well um [noise]\nSo I think one of the real strengths much like military populations is there's often are all kinds of bonds among these groups um so they can rely on each other for support\nAnd it does sound like they're getting ... briefings and other kinds of a more professional support I think first of all the fact that their distress is being acknowledged that's a real step forward and the past they would have been expected to kind of\nYou know suck it up as part of the job so you know I think that's a positive thing that we are recognizing the traumatic impact on his populations\nAnd getting them help for it um and I think often that the you know kind of they've been through this incident together and they're often the best people to help each other recover but getting some professional mental health support and and stress coping and traumatic coping is definitely important as well\nThere was a vigil in the city of Amsterdam the other night there wasn't vigilant screw Erie County closer to the actual accident how do these vigils helping the healing process\nI think these events are so important and in a way it's especially important not for the people who were directly impacted but for those of us who maybe were part of the community or you know I think everyone when an event like this occurs we can find\nSome way of identifying with the people impacted we are the same age we know people the same age we have kids the same age we've gone on similar outings\nI'm ... and it's just important that we recognize that and you know when people have that kind of distress\nThey want they want to do something with it they want to come together as a community um so I think it's really an egg in a positive thing that these events are being held they give people a place to come together to something to do with those emotions um of course you know attending a vigil doesn't\nTake away the distress and it shouldn't but I think it's important that as human beings we mourn for people we don't even know just as we\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus

people a place to come together to something to do with those emotions um of course you know attending a vigil doesn't\nTake away the distress and it shouldn't but I think it's important that as human beings we mourn for people we don't even know just as we'd want strangers to mourn if the last ... hours and so these community gatherings are kind of a great way of kind of coming together and and showing that support even if we don't know the people directly impacted\nAs the investigation continues it's becoming more clear that this was something that probably could have been avoided man has been charged criminally negligent homicide there's a lot of indications weapons vehicles should not have been on the road that leads to anger in what happens with that anger to those infected\nAbsolutely that would involve anger I mean this event was so clearly preventable um I think you know there is something of a mild bright side and the fact that even though the driver was killed in the event as well and so it will never really know you know what\nHis responsibility was but the fact that the company operator has been arranged now and hopefully it's going to face punishment I think that may provide some comfort for some of the family members you know when something is human caused whether that's an intentional act of violence like a terrorist attack or shooting or in this case something more related to negligence\nJust want someone to blame and they want someone to punish and I think that's completely understandable um and often it's frustrating for them because\nEspecially in cases where say the perpetrator has died in the accident or the or the events and they can't get that kind of justice at least in the criminal system that we use this kind of unsatisfied need for people that's often very hard for them to overcome um [noise] I\nThink also we often see in these kinds of events than there are changes in policies and safety procedures and that can provide some comfort as well but of course none of those ... mile silver linings take away just awful distress of knowing this really shouldn't have happened and didn't need to happen\nThere's a word that's been used quite often in the past hundred Twenty years after an event like mad as closure can close your really ever be accomplished\nThank you very much for asking about closure um no I absolutely do not believe enclosure you know there's this expectation that people will go through the five stages of grief and then they'll achieve closure and the loss won't hurt any longer that\nIs just not the reality it's not the reality for more typical deaths due to you know illness in old age it is certainly not the reality for something this tragic and traumatic\nI'm a you know people certainly can go on with their lives\nThey can rebuild their lives but I often use the analogy of when you love someone when you're attached to someone\nIt's almost like you're two trees whose roots become intertwined with each other and when one of those trees dies it kind of leaves this gap the other cheek and go on living but it's never the same it's never you know you're never hold the way that you were before which is what closure implies\nSo I think people want to be looking for ways to\nMourn the losses and acknowledge the losses and thin rebuild their lives and that's incredibly complicated especially when you have these cases where there are multiple losses like this um there is another concept that I\nDo think is much more valid enclosure which is the idea of

these cases where there are multiple losses like this um [noise] there's another concept that I\nDo think is much more valid enclosure which is the idea of bereavement overload\nWhich is basically the concept of you know we're we're we're pretty good at dealing with individual losses as human beings because we have to be we don't have any other choice in life but when you have multiple losses like this um it just can be too much for someone to deal with it once and especially think about the fact that\nIn many of these cases for these families and these friends\nThe people that they would have turned to end coping with a single one of these deaths are not available because they've also died in the same event so not only are they dealing with multiple losses at once but they're doing that without the normal support system that they would turn to under more typical circumstances\nDr Carla from human is an associate professor in the psychology department at the state University of New

it was not improvised that was written down\nThis is very intentional right this is coming from them and it's it's kind of a strategy I was talking to Frank Luntz\nIs Joel ribs ... he's a former state representative he's thirty two years old or the Republican candidate is Pete Stauber he in St Louis county commissioner\nHe's a retired to loose Minnesota police officer and independent in this race too so how he's going to shape this race is gonna be interesting his name is ray sandman people columns skipped\nSo this is a district where in sort of an unusual thing for twenty Eighteen Republicans\nAre on off and right and if Democrats want to try to take back the house they need twenty three seats to net to do that and you know they need to hold places like this if\nThey want to have a real shock marquee this district like\nWell it's massive it starts just north of Minneapolis St Paul and spends all the way up to the Canadian border it's really been a democratic stronghold Democrats have held at since Nineteen forty seven with the exception of a Tea Party upset in twenty ten\nEver since that upset it has been in play Republicans every two years have a run a campaign that have come close to winning\nThey're very optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points on the eighth district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually the largest swing of any district in the country from President Obama to President Trump\nAnd to the demographics tell a lot of that story told me\nThey do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it with Donald Trump's blessing the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year they fought a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August so stoppers had a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play mining is a\nBig issue up in the eighth district the third party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says that could threaten the water resources that could have a significant effect on the race if Independence Party candidates you'll love support that would have otherwise gone up a Democrat\nBoth ... I've been talking also a lot about taking back our government here is a Democrat ... recent debate\nWay to wrestle control from the special interests in Washington DC and invest power and the people and rules just like this\nHealth care is another big issue in this race were ... like many Democrats is calling for single payer universal healthcare Stauber says that's a bad idea here's we're done if it's going after his job or on the issue at that same debate\nOpponent ... at two minutes now to talk about health care and that's not what for one single idea that would result in coverage for more American\nStreaming support for WAMC come from virtually Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've got struck me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nSingle payer universal healthcare Stauber says that's a bad idea here's we're done if it's going after his job or on the issue at that same debate\nMy opponent Christopher that two minutes now to talk about health care and it's not what for one single idea that would result in coverage for more Americans\nCaught up with stop or in the southern end of the district north of the twin cities recently he's also trying to frame or done a veterans of political opportunity someone who moved from Minneapolis back up north to get into the race\nFifty two years of of life on this earth and I I've spent the vast majority of my life outside politics [noise] my opponent has been in politics\nEntire life my hearing from voters you're out there\nWell people are engaged Democrats and Republicans both claimed that they have the most voter enthusiasm behind them as the election draws near\nA Democrats are saying some people who voted for Donald Trump buyer's remorse and they're looking now to try to cast a vote against Trump in the mid term elections in support people like a German ...\nRepublicans oh say they're equally fired up and they're saying as we've been hearing a lot all week that's a battle over Brett Kavanaugh has really really fired up their base and they think that that is going to be enough at least in northern Minnesota to flip a district from democratic to Republican control\nWell I'm Mark thank you for joining us absolutely my pleasure thanks for having me and then parents America ... thank you do your welcoming\n[noise]\n\nThis\nIs the politics show from NPR we'll be right back\nTo port comes from the ... museum at Kennedy Harry presenting harvest feast October thirteenth to benefit the museum local beverages farm to table foods prepared by chefs consortium live music ticket information at our museum dot org river valley co-op Northampton, Massachusetts\nFood co-op featuring fresh local food the deli department which made to order sandwiches\nUh soup and salad bar and the bakery river valley dot C.

elections breaking down the major theme for seeing that\nI Need you to your friends your family your neighbors your\nWorkers and you did vote for Republicans\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm is hot but of history as a guide most Americans won't vote in the mid term [noise] even when they're eligible one of the reasons why I haven't but it is because I feel that I'm always busy\nBeing away from home but also connected to the political system I don't believe that it actually affect us\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR's to medical mountain RO and off Mulholland hey guys hey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well not right\nAnd that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their bases because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut I'll smoke why aren't they voting\nThe it's complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I could go on and on it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also is\nThere are some people who actually are just obstructed from voting like they want to vote but they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of\nNot feeling like their vote matters but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerge and also I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for\nThe audience to share sure I mean so the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundit talking about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it's even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a right around the Las Vegas strip\nAnd why it went there in particular was it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen and there's an Eighteen to twenty five to twenty nine year old is how they oh wow\nThat's not even that young and there was a young guy I met his name is ... he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd and you know he basically was very confused with the system he initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nI've never voted before morals from what all I Know about voting as you show up to the whole place and you hope I don't know what I Need to bring on an even know what happens during the\nSpring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think him like he wasn't the only person who expressed this confusion\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life

increasingly through like Google but I Do think to him like he wasn't the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote\nWhich I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies is is\nSort of things that we assume people knew but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy\nEighteen to twenty nine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rate\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections and mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nAre having to do with various kinds of pollution\nAnd this particular week of the weakening of regulation had to do with just spending the scientific advisory board\nFor particulate pollution now that's the kind of air pollution that doesn't come in a gas form it's made up of tiny solid particles that can get into your lungs and this follows on the heels of other UPA proposals up weaker regulations on radiation exposure and mercury emissions and\nOur last month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involves health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had to close Senate both in fact as close as the Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty ... not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of\nAbsolute minimum stopgap before you got more permanent arrangement other Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap and uh so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty fifty so the regulations remain in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nThese plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine log they could review\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on one of the

through the mid term elections we're going to be here with a special broadcast breaking down the issues on voters' minds [noise]\nWith one of the gyms just stuck\nIn the history of our church\nRepublicans one thought the major tax cut they passed we'd be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an all out looting of America the wholesale robbery of the middle class\nWe're going to dig into the policy of a big tax law and how that's affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered this more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are you going to be with you\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed this thing let's talk about what within it can you give us a quick recap of what was in this big tax bill\nYeah the big top line thing for the people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent or Twenty one percent they also made things a little bit simpler for individuals they made the standard deduction almost double\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including may go robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nTop line things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent a Twenty one percent they\nAlso made things a little bit simpler for individual they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit\nBut they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction is that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they can deduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill in check\nThey put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax and you could write some of that off\nThat it also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income brackets\nScott this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economist and the CDO forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional\nYeah they're the nonpartisan official scorekeeper for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House think no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's gonna make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one so basically\nWe're going to go into the mid term elections where people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not at a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kind of high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the desks it's expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans\nWanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to you until it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticized\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems provide an orthopedic services in the Berkshires including may go robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nBelong to you and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats is they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to re people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed also campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that they use of aren't real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax credit had kind of a a momentary high water mark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers are and and for a

pollock watched them doing this week or so I'm explaining how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school\nI saw the run a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the air safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during these drills [noise] so the first little glitch\nThey came to was that some of the team

the doors\n[noise]\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to\nThem I I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own and and\nSo I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle it down\nAnd which is different you know the first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss\nBecause if I miss [noise]\nThere's a possibility somebody else getting her [noise]\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to shoot one of his ... and a lot of these shootings

school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than work day and I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nEven still even with that and we still had\nHas if you have people that are going to return to their family\nDid the training they received save lives that day were didn't it such an open question one of our producers Robin semi and went to ... to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that new clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery ... every day says what occurred black it this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedure that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were asked to non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually did for another second and our doorway still confused then she went to her left all the way down the hall to set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building looking terrified you know when you see terrify kids running like that and it's\nThey they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise] [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe tried to back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group that smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I Would yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the town how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was laughing there were terrified people reading and I just I could not in all conscious as leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you

happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a please send you went in here\nAnd then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as
