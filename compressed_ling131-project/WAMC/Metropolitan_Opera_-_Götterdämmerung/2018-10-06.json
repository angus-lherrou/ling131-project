and political reporter Tim Mak everybody hey there right so it's pretty clear by the limits of margins Brett Kavanaugh headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking\nThat she was going to be supporting Kavanaugh and then just a few minutes later Joe mansion the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting Kavanaugh and that brought us to very clearly locked in yes votes\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nAnd I'm just going to be watching to see if the Senate is just a different place now are they able to recover from fighting so bitterly and are they able to cut deals that are necessary to do the basics of governing or did this continued to be just a toxic political environment\nAnd and for me it's it's all of that plus what's the effect on the Supreme Court several senators and they're closing speech has pointed out that there's more institutional trust him the Supreme Court than any other institution and all of that's fading fast as well so\nIf we're finally formally viewing the Supreme Court is justice partisan and tribal as everything else where does that leave us\nYeah that's a really good question and I think that the only way we're going to find an answer is just to wait\nThat was NPR's Kelsey Snell Ayesha Rascoe and Tim Mak\nThanks everybody thanks glad to be here Thanks This is the politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it's time now for race of the we\nRun into the United States Senate\nAnd the people of color or need your help we will never backed down by and if we buy\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate rent ... with us as well as the ... and diminished go walk us through\nWhat race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and served two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIs it really is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign huh in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can yes wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this little bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning the his governor for re electing\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had to change in major part she says\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu actually\nLet me the many honest with you at risk up in the beginning the his governor for electing\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that you've heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's at a change of heart in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane ...\nHe's showing me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAn awesome it can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYeah it's still an active it's will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate as you point out was being hosted by the local tell them when does dish and it was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up health care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country\nBill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians the other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being the hardliners on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race or the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this is not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the center it absolutely\nIn fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls or he's lead in last for ... for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said of the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and it was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nOr an incentive to Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or the medical mountain are Oh thanks so much You're welcome an alcoholic thank you

politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed in to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you got some of the things we're going to talk about what\nIs in big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh\nSo let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital\nThey actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an authorization bill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve he's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all of its functions\nBut we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum coverage is giving a bigger seats in Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nTo do that also uh to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they haven't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking All right and another big thing that happened\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNow have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress do do that also to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for the cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated the Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic in how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott as a renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nI just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend no would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligible for treatment\nAnd they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them passengers and diplomats to the United nations so\nThose people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the couples that the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world\nBut and fewer than ... percent of the United nations countries is that\nPossible so is there a plan for for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nAround That's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as

and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally divide the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years where\nRed America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one field the worst I think because he originally hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so\nEmotionally wrong that even watching it was emotional it was upsetting [noise]\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state patch patient in disbelief\nRepublican disbelief or the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one\nThere are people who haven't picked aside\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate\nAnd it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation in our\nFirst act Arizona Senator Jeff flake

chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months that he tried to pass some kind of Taco Bell and she was with him

inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get the elevator to get to the boat\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he would be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination was confronted by a mob of screening
