strictly bacon they think that's better so I think as a matter of what you're used to and then when you get something different you're like oh man that's so good so I thought it was better about Richard\nWell it's it's it's sicker and there's more meat to letting up and they actually would serve it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nLike baking it didn't taste like him on us you know ... and I thought if I could import stuff would ruin the bacon market\nIn this country [laughter] I I Love that UK bacon that back being that it to me it's media it's less it's less chance of being limp but\nIt is true that a lot of people a lot of continental and a lot of\nBrits come to this country and suddenly freak out\nOver they act like re there like where have you been all my life was I don't think you make the desert that these guys made with respect no because then you might as well be using a steak and we might thank you Richard we might as well talk about that right now you brought something that may actually engineered extremely happy chocolate chip cookies with bacon or so\nLet me start by saying that I took what I consider to be one of the best recipes I ever created in my life from our book the ultimate chocolate cookie book which is they believe it or not vegan chocolate chip\nCookie nowhere ... begins are about to go mental and what's in these cookies is teeny and maple syrup in ... which is a nice video can recognize us me and then I said\nLook we're going to see re and he loves bacon yes I'm going to make these cookies and I'm going to add bacon in his home when they do I fried up half a pound of bacon and they measured out to render fat and I used that fat in the cookies along with the shortening\nThen when I started the chocolate chips into the batter crumbled and the super crunchy bacon\nAny fancy urban market but if you live very rarely you might have to drive a bit so the no nitrates no nitrates is easy no sugars a little harder because if they're not using nitrogen nitrates sugar is often part of the salt of the other kinds of cures so that you really have to read labels and search for\nNow on the other part of the question was um [noise] what was that it wrapping right they write he wanted a rapid chicken\nSo there are a lot of recipes that call for wrapping things in bacon and everything from scallops to chickens when you wrap scale up in a piece of bacon\nBy the time the bacon Chris the scallop is cooked for certainly that's done right when you rapid chicken unfortunately\nThe bacon is going to be very very well done before the chicken is cooked through so you have two choices you can skip that whole concept or you can wrap it in the bacon and once the bacon is cooked as far as you want it to be covered in foil\nAnd that will continue to cook and the flavor will soak in there and then for for the last two or three minutes take the foil also ...\nAnd let me also say that I Would ... long in many years ago back when I was a real southern or I Would sometimes chop up one piece of raw bacon\n... just brace yourself or mix it with butter and shove it under the skin of a chicken before I cooked it what's wrong with that so well it's just\nA bit over this is a little upset about it over the top and just that one piece of begun ... you know caught up very fine and then input in soft butter and you know where you make a pocket between the skin and the meat and the chicken and you rub the butter under their rights with that baking it it's pretty crazy now the baking will never get crunchy under there\nBut it was all about the flavor and that will work labor said chicken like you cannot fathom all\nRight let's take a break here are our guests are Bruce wants to do to mark Scarborough the phone number is eight hundred\nThree for eight to

kind of left off that idea but I understand that you have I have a drink that has bacon and\nWell the drink in question here is in our book the boozy blender yeah and what we decided after worrying up bacon in the blender was that that's a little gross so to drink in the book is called the Godzilla 'cause it's green and it's big and it's powerful okay\nAnd I made bacon swivel sticks that you stir around in the drink and then you eat the bacon was soaked up with all the booze on is how do you make those take those large bamboo skewer as you buy the supermarkets ten inches\nAnd you take each piece of bacon and you read it onto the skewer flat the long way right so you're\nYou're building a ribbon like a ribbon you're putting the skewer through the streets of bacon put them back on that baking sheet we talked about and roast them at three hundred and fifty degrees are about twenty minutes till they're really crispy and then just stick one of those into the drink\nAnd then we decided that if you even stick one of those into an old fashioned range as you could have a bourbon you could even stick one of those into a malted to get that ice cream being very always dreamed are nice but you know it's still it's still not what I'm looking for there is something in historical bacon vodka\nI don't want I Want some how very dry crispy bacon finally done and mixed into a mixed drink and I\nAnd re what happens when you put dry bacon into a wet drink you drink\nOkay sure and what happens in the bay has to be very refined ... well you could powder it actually I live I mean okay so you'd
