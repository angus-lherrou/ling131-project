chocolate and we did and it was delicious the really good licorice comes from Australia right Tom I mean I so\nSo what we did it you know this is good so one day I was I'm enjoying the butter crunch and somebody was talking about the licorice and it just struck me that perhaps we ought to make a licorice butter crunch so\nWe added the licorice the any soil into the\nButter crunch batch and it was really good\nFrench so we added the licorice the any oil into the uh butter crunch batch\nAnd it was really good but then I decided it needed even to go step farther so I decided to put a sea salt on

five five one eight hundred three for eight to five five one on this food friday and hopefully we'll be back\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Lisa Mullen\nI'm Peter O'Dowd and we're waiting for a news conference from the Justice Department just a few minutes from now will be learning new details in our top story today one person\nIs in custody in South Florida in connection with a series of suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump let's bring in Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie or tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nAnd parents identifying him as seats are say he's fifty six years old from South Miami as you said and his background includes a long wrap sheet a number of charges for related to drugs and soft\nAnd also charge in two thousand two for a threatening to throw place project or discharge an explosive device he also has a bankruptcy in his past and we also know he's a registered Republican you\nSaid that he has a ... long criminal record and the police were aware of him would do we know what led them to him at this point in this investigation\nWe are going to wait to hear from the Justice Department the FBI the postal inspectors and others about what exactly are led authorities to this man so quickly that markedly swift investigation is President Trump has already said this morning\nWe do know that a number of the device and we're not exploded so they were in ... in essence a mother load of evidence for the FBI lab in Quantico the FBI lab has been looking at whether there was any DNA are fingerprints on those devices we don't yet know whether I suspect may have left those traces which led authorities to him so quickly\nCan you talk about the fact that these bombs did not explode was one of the big question leading up to this arrest was it on purpose that the suspect with ... you know just a bad bomb maker or was it um you know something else I'm sure that's something investigators will be tracking\nA ... a authorities are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone who came across such a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it were dangerous and to not touch it not handle it call ... ... and at the local level are called the FBI so it's not yet clear to me whether this person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber\nOr wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other uh issue at play and has making these devices\nAre once again we're talking to NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to\nGive a news conference on the latest on the investigation into the male bombings that's happening at the bottom of the hour carry the arrests do they expect that they're going to be making anymore do they have any idea if the man they arrested today was acting as as a lone wolf\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all people involved in this right now we know that Cesar ... the only person in federal custody I think the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help\nAny assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question\nWhat about the white van we saw pictures of it on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspect because of course there were images of the president there were also you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in this investigation but do we know anything about why investigators\nWe're also you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in this investigation but do we know anything about why investigators came and got to that than\nWe do know that Cesar ... was taken into custody in or near an auto zone fitness and that shortly thereafter\nPeople with FBI jackets and other law enforcement were seen securing the white van and transporting it uh possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes authorities have not on the record yet connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that question we do know that there was a massive manhunt under way for this individual that involve federal and local authorities\nAcross multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were awaiting this press conference from\nThe Justice Department of but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of this story a Republican strategist Alex Stewart is with us now Alex welcome to you thank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host at hill TV Jamal Simmons\nHigh speed or a ... a ... want to start with you know how suspects are in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this has been a very politically fraught past couple of days\nIt has been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to\nThe FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehension so swift and I bring bring about a a sense of calm and and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nI I think if we're looking at this through the the political ... we have\nTo give some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause of this or the motive of of this is a this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wise to say that anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law\nAnd to rightly claimed and called this spectacle a despicable act of political violence and it's time to\nHave peace in the United states\n... I'm Sorry I interrupted you do want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to a really want him to try um I I've been supportive so far that every time he spoke out on the street give his words that are about something a little like so and then ... minutes or hours later he does is desert sweet something\nThat is to blame on the victims let the media or you know tries to lessen this in some way to make light of it in some way and I think\nThe president um his job right now and not all of his job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president\nAnd do something well maybe he called President Obama may be called President Clinton and awkward has\nIs health and made sure that the FBI all the other sources of their disposal they were protected it you know him and made sure the attorney general Jeff Sessions called ... older to make sure he was going to be okay this is a moment we're supposed to reach out and not just with words\nYou know and make sure the attorney general Jeff Sessions all ages older to make sure he was going to be okay but this is the moment we're supposed to reach out and not just with words but\nAlso with the actions well that's what\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those do whom the the the male bombings there were bombs were addressed\nUm but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe the pro Trump ... stickers on the windows of and then he is apparently a Trump supporter so how would you as a Republican strategist Alex advise leaders of the party to address is\n... ... more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and that was not in a favorable term\nAnd I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send a message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and uh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions\nBe heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say\nThat in my view the call to end the right to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a firm and consistent message and as you said it needs to not be Justin word but also an action\nWe were in your same starting at the top meeting with the president a drawl absolutely how do you think Democrats should deal with it\nLuke William hunt former FBI special agents I Want to ask you one more question before I ask you a to hang tight\nOr what your thoughts on the fact that these devices never exploded not one of them does it is it assigned to you that this suspect was a bad bomb maker or that but you know he he didn't want them to explode\nWell I'm ... you know this is this is a completely uncommon ... and one thing that you see what this kind of thing it's just sort of jumped to sort of terrorize people um even if you have someone who's not capable of\nOf actually creating a a a an active\nDevice it's going to explode a this is obviously a way to terrorize people are just sort of get back\nAt the other side if there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I I think that's that's um probably the uh the the big I'm a motivation there\nOkay hang hang with us if you can ah NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department is remind us who it is a that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a lineup we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general in the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and not important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI in New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office Williams Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nAh we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderous row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of the top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time fades at the Justice Department\nAnswer unanswered questions\nDid he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's tire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he wasn't addressed to package and there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out law enforcement desperately it's gonna be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offered detonate um they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help\nAnd what he was planning next if anything as\nFor motives it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to this aspect fifty six year old Cesar ... Crump South Florida in that Twitter account he has gone off after prominent Democrats including some of whom have who haven't been to address\nFlorida in that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address a use of the suspicious packages and that's one hand to add to his motive but of course law enforcement it's going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reach out for the audience where we stand now with already the rest of the south Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement is confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as interested in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also have some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned the Democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages did he issue a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said I'm it's confirmed that a suspicious package mailed to Tom dire was intercepted had a male facility in California he says\nWe're thankful every one we work with\nIs safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida and he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity er during this very dark period where many prominent Democrats have been at a recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions that you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far though the people who've gotten these packages of and critics of the president\nI'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next door that they're taking precautions in case they are\n[noise] I have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking on yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days\nOf course some of the targets a were intended recipient of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder the former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper\nAnd another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet family\nHave all those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAh for the vast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages you know the images that you have seen\nJustice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former FBI special agent to teachers in the criminal Justice Department in Radford University in Virginia a new country there yeah I'm here yes so you've seen on TV a lot of ... have described it as Kerry just did what the packages of looked like\nIt at what point if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either did socks\nPackages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either ... or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe somebody who's a a copycat and nothing happens in cases like these\nYeah yeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know ... it's obviously a easy to get some of these materials that that it's a lot of materials or are they common and so it's really going to take a a a close look by law enforcement to confirm whether or not\nIt is I'm the same suspect or copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of by the ... FBI a lab all back in the field office looking at the actual forensics um so it's not going to be an easy call a quick call until it's actually had a a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah oh that's\nThat's a great question I mean I I think as a as a couple of things so Thursday's got a a interrogate the structure and show 'em if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have a sense of of how forthcoming is\nHow you know what his lowly age what else is out there the other thing is just as a collaborative and the electronic evidence is you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records\nThat might give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or in his car business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive the threats are so I Would say within the next\nYou know twenty four hours you're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a done an initial interrogation um and and you should have a good idea of how far this has gone with this particular suspect but then there's all the question of\nAgain isn't working with someone else a tracking down any potential each other a associates that may have been helping\nIts ... William hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson ... it looks like it'd be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrest that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a white van with all sorts of political details apparently pro Trump ... spent the count on the side of it do we know for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the suspect he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding or on the idea that it is somehow connected to the fact that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that\nIn the next two minutes or so when a news conference art as law enforcement decides to tell us what if anything this individual is charged with and how they know that and it's easy to say that the individual you're talking about a fifty six years old daily Florida where he is he right now\nHe is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as an authority or trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety we have gotten a warning\nThat this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started within the next few seconds to say thank you dilute William hunt former FBI special agent thanks very much for your incite", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Food Friday Vox Pop", "city": "Albany", "day": "26"}
