British or district attorney David Cape was continues to loom over the campaign to replace him\nThe race began with controversy surrounding how ... was installed his successor Paul could be yellow\nAnd hasn't cooled down since then cable is himself has been largely silent since stepping down in March until today when he spoke with our Berkshires bureau chief Josh landers and the second part of their interview ... was asked why so many employees of the da ... office have donated to their bosses campaign\nPeople who believe a in Paul\nPeople who believe in what he stands for not only what he has done for what they see is a continuing the future uh and they want to be able to do it the people who work in the district attorney's office are very committed people uh to uh what that office stance for its responsibilities and carrying them out\nAnd these people believe that this is not a matter of political contributions no one was ever expected I never expected anywhere in the office to ever contribute but I never a turn them down because I Know that they did it because they believed in what I stood for and what we all stood for\nTurning back the clock almost a year when you first began planning this process of succession that would put Mr cockatoo yellow in the office and time to campaign for the seat as we're seeing right now what was the vision of this that you express when you had discussions with officials at a state level about this possible fans Asian\nWell ... you know\nIt wasn't exactly as you describe it uh uh I decided that uh I was not going to I'm a a seek reelection I was going to retire\nThe question became how when when a that was going to happen\nAnd um I met with a uh the governor's office in ... discuss that situation a and recommended that Paul will be the one to replace me if I were to 'em or leave a earlier than just at the end of my term uh and that's in fact what did happen\nI think that any complaints about the process and of course as you know uh I I have said and others have set in my defense this was a completely open thing I had a press conference to announce a what was taking place and and how does it come about\nOf but the simple fact is that all that a ms Harrington can complain about is that what she wasn't considered for the position or with Paul and that only means that uh she would have been a publicly uh rejected a by the governor in favor of Paul because that's absolutely what would've happened\nDo you see at this point this election is sort of a referendum on your entire time in office given how much criticism has been levied against you by both miss hearings and and the night\n[noise] well I I think it would be ironic to say that this campaign is now a referendum on my ministry ... when a until the time that I had announced that I was retiring or in that I Would not be running a neither ms Harrington nor ms night\n... ah that I was retiring a and that I Would not be running a neither ... nor ms night or anyone else had a indicated any uh\nIntention of running against me a\nA it's a now the situation where the now that I'm Out of office they seem to think that they can take pot shots at me because I don't have a ...\nA a platform to respond to them well you know that's false I don't think it's a referendum on me I think it's a misunderstanding of what my office has done and the misrepresentation of what my office did\nThat is former British or da de became was speaking with our Berkshires bureau chief Josh land to use you can hear the entire interview at WAMC Don orange
