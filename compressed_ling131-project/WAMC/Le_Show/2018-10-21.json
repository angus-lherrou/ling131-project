Stephanie killed and and uh she talked about something called modern monetary theory you know a lot of listeners weren't treat by some time has passed many things have happened\nAnd uh I thought it was an opportune time to welcome Dr killed me back to the show she's professor of public policy and economic Stony Brook University in New York formerly professor of economics at the University of Missouri Kansas City\nShe was she comes from the U.S Senate budget committee minority party staff that is the Democratic party stuff\nAnd a founder and editor in chief of the blog new economic\nPerspectives a doctor killed welcome back thank you so much for having me back [noise] looks to do with a ... a little really limited stuff at the beginning I'm just so people don't feel left behind or or just so people don't start reading the left behind Bush what is macro economics\nMacroeconomic ... it's a big picture stuff right as distinct from ... which focuses on things like individual consumer behavior or the behavior of individual firms macroeconomic tries to rapid arms around the entire economy and ask questions like\nAnd yet there appears to be lots of evidence that the economy can absorb additional stimulus and more people will come in take jobs there are a lot of people who are still out of the labor market\nUh who who we think would be brought back in and have a lot of people millions of people who are working part time\nEconomists say part time for economic reasons which means they want more hours but their bosses won't give them additional hours so they're stuck in part time work when they really want full time work with benefits and so forth so I'm\nThere I it isn't clear how much more ah unemployment there is in the economy you know how how much closer we can get to something like you know genuine full employment without creating an inflation problem but I don't think we're there yet\nYou mentioned benefits I I get the impression from some stuff I read that one of the\nReasons employers won't employ more people fulltime when they do now is because they want for precisely the reason they want to avoid\nThe obligation to pay benefits is there any data to support or rude rebut the\nThere there is not only data to support that there's plenty of anecdotal evidence as well I mean in my previous posed as a at the University of Missouri where I was chair of the economics departments\nI can remember um being cautioned by uh the dean and other administrators to be careful or chairs to be careful when\nA hiring adjunct professors and then you know putting people over that threshold where these or she would be on the hook for benefits and so it just you know it's a a a feature of our disastrous healthcare policy and delivery

chart that are sort of stands out as is particularly\nMemorable and made them demonic\nWhich is the the um I guess it is of\nComes out of the banking background of a one or more of the people in empty which is the accounts have to balance that good a spending on one side of the balance sheet equals income on the other side of the balance sheets and you talk a little bit about the\nSure ah the charge you referring to we usually refer to it at the sector financial balances chart or the ... that's ... that's that's a catchy name for an IV rolled off the tongue\nAnd you know it's funny about that thing is you're right uh we use that we use in a in empty but a lot of other people use it like ... to the chief economist at Goldman Sachs\nHas referred to that chart and these are his words the most important grass in the world you say wow what is so important about these three lines right how why why are studying and understanding this thing so important\nAnd what I usually do when I you know speak to audiences and they introduced this chart and it is a mind bender it really does flip the perspective I Walk in and people have a certain understanding of the way government deficits work and by and large the audience thinks the government's budget\nUh ought not to be in deficits that it would be better to eliminate deficits and even better if we could get the government's budget into surplus that kind of the starting point for people\nAnd then they voted in again you're talking about the federal government 'cause it's very different pres right local gr good\nExactly for the federal government so and so this is the starting point for most of these people so I Walk in and I put up this chart and I say okay\nLet's let's talk about this let's talk about what the government's deficit really it and and you know I started at basically zero with them and I say what did the government ... really mean what it means is that the government is putting more money into the economy than it's taking back out case or if it spends a hundred in\nBut it only taxes Ninety back out\nWe label that a deficit and everybody gets all you know their hackles\nUp because the government's budget is in deficit but it's like walking through life with one eye open and the other I closed you gotta open both eyes so that you can see both sides of the ledger it's these are accounting identity as you said everything has to ... to zero where everything has to balance\nSo if the government's budget ends up in deficits with ten somebody else's budget ends up in a surplus with ten and that's what this sector balance Graff does it brings that in that ...\nAnd so people are able to see effectively that the government's red ink hit our black ink\nAnd so I can walk them through history through the fifties and sixties and seventies and\nAnd that period in the late seventies early eighties when the when the trade balance goes from deficit into a from surplus into deficit when the U.S begins renting trade deficits and all that and I walk them through the whole thing and then we get to the Clinton years and we stopped\nAnd I say okay here we are Bill Clinton is president\nNineteen Ninety eight Ninety nine two thousand two thousand and one for years running the government's budget federal government's budget is in surplus\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hurt US DOT com a no ... no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nIs that the budget for the rest of the economy the private sector moved deeply into deficit at that time and they can see it All right there before their eyes and suddenly\nThey're not so excited about the prospect of having the government's budget surplus or even in balance they suddenly gain a new appreciation for government deficits because they can see that they're in fact the source of the surplus to the rest of the economy\n[noise] it it strikes me 'cause I'm old enough to have seen a lot of different administrations come and go sadly um no actually fortunately that um the out party whether Republican or Democrat\nVery often seems to be more hawkish about deficits than the in party\nOr the the ... party for a various reasons um different between the two parties but the the the in party always liked to spend money more than a dozen and that the out party always liked to a ... for a creating deficit\nSo that now the Democrats are the deficit hawks the Republicans make these tax cuts they make the spouse or a very big defense budget increase and uh you know do worry about it do worry about it ... it'll take care of itself\nIt's almost well I guess it's really supply side economics again but you know the growth in the economy from the tax cuts will pay for the tax cuts and even more have we ever seen that are actually ... the uh [noise]\nOf refined and data on no but you know what you it might be possible to have at work\nThat way it's just that they keep constructing their tax cuts in the worst possible way which is to say almost all of the benefits go to the people who are least likely to turn around and spend the windfall back into the economy so\nEighty three eighty four percent of all of the benefits from the recent one point five trillion Republican tax cut\nVirtually all of the benefits go to the top one percent\nOvertime now\nIf you were really trying to have tax cuts do the supply side art Laffer curve trickle down thing pay for themselves and all that stuff and presumably you would construct tax cuts exactly the opposite way I Would make sure that yeah you make sure that the money goes to the people who are the most likely to turn around it's been virtually all of it back\nInto the economy might in fact create so much of a boom\nThat tax revenue goes up and and you know the thing quote unquote pays for itself ...\n... ah I guess Republicans would say but jobs are part of the private economy too aren't they\nYeah yeah there are I mean there are a great incentives for private jets and a a ... for\nIt but I mean that that is the private economy as well I mean it's not just grows well known no\nQuestion so if something that windfall it's a very very wealthy take some of that tax break and and buy a new yacht somebody's got to build it somebody's going to be employed\nProducing that yachts you get a few jobs out of that but not the kind of ... you know widespread job growth that the Republicans were touting when they told us that this would be the greatest you know they called it the tax cut and jobs bill\nSo really once opposed to the aid lots and lots of a new job did not just new jobs higher paying jobs that with the promise\nMellowed a a lot of time we we spoke\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hurt US DOT com or no choke no poll Doug heartless

the crash of two thousand eight and\nA as I recall I thought I think you and your colleagues start austerity was exactly the wrong approach to dealing with the crash\nWell yeah I mean like we were saying earlier the what you want the government's budget to do is is behave counter cyclical you not pro\nCyclical and austerity is pro cyclical policy a mean\nAt the exact same time that your economy is turning down because everyone it in the private sector's tightened their ... the government tightened it felt as well which is the same as just putting a new sign everyone and saying you know we're all going to jump to gather a it's precisely the wrong policy and not only that\nOr just a giant state government\nExcept as you noted you know when when you're in a position to run the table if if you have divided government\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hurt US DOT com or no choke no poll Doug Curtis invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the

sleeves\nRight a budget that delivers the windfall to your constituencies that these are the people that I'm here to work on behalf of my donors to the the well the big corporations and you use the budget process in a way that focuses not on what happens to the budget where the budget ends up\nBut on you know how the budget can be used as a tool to benefit your constituents that's exactly what the Republicans have done very very good at it\n[noise] um when my contract with when the Democrats were in a position to run the table or ... and we're in the middle of a financial crisis and uh some of the president's economic advisors were calling for a\nStimulus program of at least a trillion dollars I think uh and uh the president thought that he had to bargain down in order to\nTry to compromise with Republicans who who told you to me to the point\nYou're exactly right they were in a position to run the tables centrally Christina Romer a who was um very influential at the time in the Obama administration professor from UC Berkeley and I think she famously was pushing it gets come out that she was pushing for something closer to one point eight trillion dollars\nAnd you know you had Larry Summers and others also part of the conversation there with dialogue about concern\nA sticker shock was the term that was thrown around you know anything bigger than a trillion would just you know the population couldn't handle it the sticker shock would be too much\nAnd so you're right a President Obama went in and said\nBasically will start at seven hundred and eighty or so billion and negotiate our way up and we know now that was done not direct tactic he should start\nUp and expect to potentially negotiate your weight down and he ... he did he did he did and and remember that he you know it wasn't just a few months in office as the as everything is falling apart and the deficit explodes because not because of anything Congress did but\nBecause the downturn was so severe and the economy was hemorrhaging jobs and so people losing their jobs\nYou know get to a variety of um support mechanisms from the government you know ... food stamps and unemployment compensation and Medicaid a whole host of programs automatically kick in to support a weak economy and then meanwhile\nPeople become jobless their incomes collapse and federal tax receipts fall off a cliff so desperate to just blows up all on its own and a President Obama goes on TV and he's asked about this explosion in the deficit and and you know the government trying to do something to prop up the economy and they say\nKnow what at what point do we run out of money and I don't know if you remember his response but he said\nWe're out of money now and I thought oh no you know\nThat is a and that really boxes un because once you say essentially we've done all we can do you know we're out of money then that just allow the economy to languish for so many years without um the supporters the support that it really needed because the fiscal authorities just\nKind of stepped away and said to the fed you know you guys got to do this because we're done\nI think you you are an and you and Alan Greenspan of both made the point that the federal government can run on the money right\nRight so that was not a use for comment ah from President Obama\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog

got\nSo I Want to go back to your Senate experience for for one more question\nObviously as a staff member\nYour main interaction is a with the members on your side of the ... the legislators on your side of the aisle but you also have a interaction with the staff members on the other side of the aisle as you try to uh put forward your understanding your micro economic understanding of this stuff\nWhat kind of response did you get from the staffers on the other side\n... how do you remember some conversations with I was the chief economist for the dams and I remember some conversations with the chief economist for the Republicans\nAnd he found that we sit and have coffee sometimes and I remember that he found it fascinating I don't know how convincing or he found it and I don't know how much time you spent really thinking it through\nBut he did there was something about when I was saying that he was receptive to and I think maybe it's because I didn't sound like what\nHe perceived to be that the typical Democrat that just you know wanted to spend more spend more than I was also open to the possibility that tax cuts could be a useful thing especially where where we were at the time you know um and so\nUh I I I remember that um but I to be honest I didn't interact a lot\nWith staff on the other side it was I was mostly dealing with Democrats and their staffers\n... is is\nDo you think that they and increased silo in effect a of reflecting the increased partisanship of Congress or is that the way it's always been\nMy son just when I arrived my sense is that it's um it's gotten worse that that it's been that way for some number of years some of the staffers that were on committee that you know when I arrived had been there for six years something like that\nAnd make sense when\nThings were different but not much different\n[noise] [noise] and they're not getting better um well I'm Dr ... thank you so much for a return visit infer revisiting
