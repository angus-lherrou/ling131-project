T. C. C. came out today and said we shouldn't cross a true if Greece Celsius threshold on a global warming\nWe're at one point one it was my understanding that we are essentially at two degrees Celsius anyway for two reasons one is that if we are there are a lot of particularly if out there from coal fire\nThat if we stop and it would instantaneously kind of heat up the earth and the second thing is that there's a lot of ... in warm meaning that uh it takes a while\nFor carbon dioxide to actually uh was created for warmth on a global warming\nSo I Would like for you to discuss that if you could and I will listen on the radio okay\nRichard shame you Mr show a couple of days ago on climate change but go ahead Barbara you go first well\nI'm climate change is real and I think there's a couple of songs to that effect might they might be giants giants um [noise]\nThe issue is predicting the future or in a way it's a gamble I mean you look at our weather reporting um I thought this weekend was going to be Seventy and now it's going to be fifty five and we're two days off so\nPredict predictability is always an issue and there's uncertainty there but some things are certain um we understand the impact to our climate by the release ... global greenhouse gases the biggest ones that we play with\nA really three we play with carbon dioxide we play with water which actually has a group global greenhouse gas rating of one we kind of set that by the standard\nUh it's about forty four carbon dioxide and then another one is methane um natural gas which we don't we do produce um but also it it's stored and a lot of different environments in our planet and if it were released it would affect a the global cycle even more\nUm the issue is what will ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHere and talk about it the more you to want to talk about the predicting the future [noise]\nWell um I can talk a little bit of both the particulates I think a lot of\nAt least some of the effect the particulates diminishing has already occurred as as burning of fossil fuels God cleaner\nSo some of the jump in and temperature that that occurred in the seventies and eighties um was probably actually do too I'm cleaning up the air some and and that kind of latent\nWarming ... took place than to just just as the caller suggested [noise] um how much more of that will happen I'm not sure how much that's big then\nThat will be a factor the effect of magnification um there's some issues for example as we industrialized we pay more roads and we pay more roads be put last dirt in the atmosphere particularly from like riding on a country road that's dirt\nSo there are offsetting pieces of all of this that are going to change it that really people wouldn't think oh I'm going to pay the road it's going to affect global warming\nBut it well we just have to be able to model it well [noise]\nYou know glad it's been it's been shown for example a back in the Nineteen seventies during a ... a lunar eclipse for example the moon would effectively go black because light from the sun passing through the atmosphere get totally absorbed by particulate matter\nAnd what's happening now is as the a lunar eclipse occurs late goes through the earth's atmosphere and actually turns the moon red and the reason for the red is because there's a lot less particulate matter so we're pretty will clear with that\nAnother another thing that one has to consider is the fact that the oceans can still suck up an awful lot of CEO too and they do a during the Nineteen sixties for example during the big blackout across the United states\nThey went up with helicopters and measure the amount of C. O. two in the atmosphere and just over a one or two day period it plummeted because the two is being absorbed by the oceans\nAdvocate and we weren't making any\nUh exactly right with 'em together so it doesn't take that much to get things they actually get cold All right let's go to Jim in Boston spots in Iran\nYeah actually I had a little bit of the things that first of all I as I pull up to my front door listening to radio ah all those\nI lose WAMC\nI posed for about ... flood and it goes back and let it happen will will will also I mean ... father is a little section there or goes away yeah that uh that I have a lot of the state of claims or a\n... a ... book was talked about a a solemn\nAnd tigers are they still think down in the ocean or great pressure races mhm\nYes there is about to get get tons of Plath rates at the bottom of the ocean mostly produced by bacterial decomposition of things ... washing off the land\nAnd uh if it ever were to get into the atmosphere we would be in big trouble in fact some people think that uh the biggest extinction of all time the Permian extinction was caused by a similar class rate uh eruption from the bottom of the ocean that would not be good\nAnd like idol a Pepsi and all the bubbles come out all at once only these bubbles would be\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAt the methane in the atmosphere in a interacts with ah with light from the sun and breaks down into CEO to it takes on now that the atmosphere so what happened is not only would we have global warming but we didn't have any oxygen to breathe\nSo it would not be a good situation not at all or your mind to sell your stock as far as the radio goes to him I think it's ... this is a handheld radio you have\nWell the car Damon ... ear explained it to me but that was years ago or so years old\nUh well I mean it should get better as a as the foreigners leaves us you'll you'll have better signal but I mean I you know there are things there are things in between our transmit around your car basically\nA a list of those ... ...\nYou have to stop [noise] yup fall into that happens all the\nTime ... you know you could get a better antenna or better receiver or Leno turned\nOut to ... to that happens or when I plan to do it's to get gas they must have transmitters the girl from the pumps to the to the main console they're inside that are why because almost always I lose whatever doesn't matter what channel that adding an overload they're up blowing through my radio spectrum\nOur number here is eight hundred three for eight to five five want us to science forum Barbara rabbits Jim picketing and the standard here and the number is eight hundred three for a two point five one David in Albany David you're on\nElectromagnetic radiation in these frequencies can do is to keep things up\nAnd if you and that has to do with the intensity so the intensity of the microwave is very high in the microwave oven and keeps things up the intensity of microwaves\nOut here we're broadcasting is taking place is very very low so if it doesn't heat it up you can't do any there there was no chemistry that can be done\nNo other frequencies besides microwaves can can heat things up and you know I was I mean I remember like ten the ten meter band which is about thirty megahertz ... uh is one that you want to make sure your power is at a reasonable level or two meters one ... one forty four Meg urge same thing\nFor ... pretty much any ... anything in the electromagnetic radiation if if it can be an indoor yeah it will it will generate heat\nWhen you have short wavelength electromagnetic radiation say ultraviolet rays or X rays are gamma rays then you can do chemistry and then you could cause diseases and stuff but\nTypical bond breaking requires ultraviolet that we would call really low a short wavelength ultraviolet so\nUm even even tanning beds although I'm not a big fan of tanning bed but even today tanning bed born a purchase in the United states don't put out that type of radiation\nBut if you can learn early but certainly when you get down to wavelengths that are longer than ... which we're ... we're talking about with anything having to do with radio or broadcast um there's just not enough energy there to do anything other than ... things up the intensity is really high\nHigh it's like having your to hand together and making friction yeah and it's really the only means of making heat\nYou got you got telephones you know so your phones which are effectively talking to the side of the towers and they're right next to your ears and there's been enormous number of studies to see whether that effect has an effect on you and effectively so far nothing's been shown\nI mean it is all about duty cycle to so if you're I guess if you are right next to a tower\nYou'd have to be living in the ... of revenue sell\nIt if it's funny my father I'm In the fifties or early sixties they were ... he worked for stay there and they were putting up the microwave links for TV yeah and I think they ever tell you there's no\nWhen they were setting up the links at times they would take a hotdog on a stick and literally hold it up in the hospital and they would have to cook that aren't that pretty impressive was ahead of his time he was\nA let's go to Michael in Massachusetts Michael you're on\n[noise] [noise] yeah I Want to ask a question about the sound of water for instance\nSometimes ... I like to brush my teeth with hot water by ... or a little weight therapy or the water ... hot\nAnd if I turn ... doing something else like I always tell where the water turns out because of how ... works going down the drain cool that same thing while I'm pouring out to like if I have a boiling water like cook pasta or something up or that down the drain that's much different sound and the port a\nPotty cold water down the drain wires read my guess would be All right but part of it having\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\n... the cold water would be less run the than the warm water so that the way that what it's all the way that it's washes around different I'll speed of sound will be different\nRight also the ah cold water versus hot water cold water has a lot more Aaron it didn't want warm water does and that can have an effect because as you released the pressure of its you'll actually get bubbles forming\nThat's how I can tell when my shower hadn't ... said yeah thinking of my showerhead changes because there's less air in the line when it got ...\nAnd then there's the other piece that if you have metal pipes and your dream yeah and they're going to get warm quickly from the warm water and their density work lately change\nRight next to Michael Sallah really at the gal speaking of um cooling and heating liquids I have a bottle of ... June in my freezer\nAnd when it's room temperature it flows very nicely and we won't freeze in the freezer but now it gets very thick and viscous why does that happen with June\nThe sugar really I Would guess that the sugar in the water from the gym I'm trying to think ethanol shorter than\nIt was quite an ocean I don't do too sweet to me it's a nice ride martini on what do you go\nThere's the protein in it though only Jen is you know ten is juniper um [noise] I Would think that the proteins can be kind of climbing together and making that think that that's really interesting I pay homework garment\nWhy don't you do some homework you know it kind of experiment my grandmother going remember knew more than two martinis per experiment going to take a long time that I Would go to Ted in ... Vermont Ted you're on\nScience thanks I appreciate the fine points of everything [laughter]\nAnd and the question of one funny little observation which I don't need to measure but it really sort of irks me that what I'm if I'm heating up something on my gas flame on the stove it of course makes a layer of water\nSo that I'm having to boil off that water or transmit he threw it until I get a dry\nThat of pan to warm my whatever I'm warming from a coach stayed in and this is more of a small person kitchen than a large chef for the great big fire and too many things to do [laughter] I ... that's just a little observation also but in\nIn thinking of we I live close to the almost great lake sham plane [noise] and of course it's\nHas its problems especially in the shallow places with a algae and so forth\nAnd people never I mean you talk about the phosphorus and nitrogen maybe in but the temperatures never mentioned and the temperature is I mean a a set of understandings based on ten years ago temperatures is different\nThan what we will be dealing with ten years from now and I just think I don't know if there's if you have any quantitative sense of it [noise]\nAh and like I also noticed by a river not the lake but a a big car lot which didn't used to be there and they all day that I think when that ... and this is more of a summer and then wonder but when on a hot day\nAnd you get a a fast rain there is a tremendous amount of hot metal cars on black top\nGushing hot water more or less into a river tens or any I'm just interested in that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nEverything history of the temperature at which of course is the biggest problems or the shallow areas of the way the shallow ones or am I ... and so forth and that's\nVery good thanks to refer she had it\nSo that several pollution is is certainly an issue um in the northeast we have been blessed with not having to deal with it much and places like Texas Oklahoma Florida Georgia\nReally have um first of course there are biological consideration like you take the amount of oxygen that can be in water and it's determined by many things but probably the biggest fluctuation in temperature\nSo more oxygen can be dissolved and water if the water's colder and less oxygen can be dissolved if the water's warmer and it's a significant change if you think of like\nJust after spring thaw you could have [noise]\nA a number of twelve for the oxygen and then if you get it up to a temperature like with the Gulf of Mexico is right now which is about Ninety eighty nine um than what you're looking at it two or three so we go from a high of twelve down to two or three\nAnd then who's breathing in that water uh what can grow in the water if there is no oxygen those are all big consideration probably the largest wanted sham playing along with our general climate and zebra mussels they clean up the water and allow the the sunlight to penetrate deep or in a column of water and so the heat up the lake more\nBut actually the hotter it is of course the more bacterial action there is which makes it even worse so you start off with a two or three and you wind up killing your fish\nYeah it's very common in late fall actually just about now when things start to cool down there's a photo synthesis stops which puts out oxygen but the bacteria keep on going and then it will crashed the oxygen and you'll get fish kills right before I doubt or ice than rather\nLet's go to Chris and delivers real Chris you're on\nFire are gone along the say a lot of questions about the properties of water I was just wondering what are the physical properties of water that make it so that it dissolves last guest\nFor most things I'm as you heat them up the gas all your ability goes down and\nIt's hard to say exactly what it is that the causes that other than the fact that the the what's called the vapor pressure of the liquid itself\nStarts coming gets higher and higher eventually has your heat heat something up when you reach the boiling point the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure and then you really can't dissolve anything other than itself in terms of gases\nRight in fact the way with gas out of water for example is to boil it for long periods of time and that makes all of the gases escape and we ended up with purified water", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Vox Pop", "city": "Albany", "day": "11"}
