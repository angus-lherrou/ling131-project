R. P. um and so there's there's different options that way and then of course physical therapy\n[laughter] well we have a physical therapist here Matthew Good motives here and the number is eight hundred three for eight to five five one to go over to Eric in Saratoga Eric\nHello ray and hello Matthew hello Eric Anderson [laughter]\nOkay I I Am a disclaimer I I Know Matt and our daughters are good friends that I've been to his office or many times and and I highly recommend Jim thought why am I just happened to be a I just happen to\nBe listening to the radio and there came a they're getting ... so\nSo mad at and I've been dealing with an e problem that I have had since the spring uh and [noise] it it came out and suddenly and that was very painful yet when I went to two worth a bit of doctors they couldn't find anything wrong with X rays or an MRI and I found that\nVery frustrating a because it hurts a lot and I was\nUnable to do many of the activities I like to do\nSo I started going into a physical therapy and and met felt that it may be a chair and my ...\nAnd you know he said that many of those can be improved and ultimately a cure it if you will with physical therapy so we were just physical therapy for a number of months and it really wasn't improving so then I went to a doctor in Saratoga\nOr who does the joint injections and\nAnd um we didn't do any further diagnostics but I did the PR pie that Matt just had mentioned that I and I also did a stem cell injection which is quite involved and um and not covered by insurance\nAnd painful as Dickens and we're about four weeks out from that now and it also have not seen any real improvement so that my urging a I got another MRI and I just\nI got the results literally as I Am just driven driven home from that and I have a ...\nA ... or so it's a complex complex there of lateral\nMovement yeah it is um and so the doctor has recommended a using a brace oh it would take away the weight off of the lateral coming so I Wonder what you think of ...\nWell the the complex nature of the terror that you just said that that does make me a little concerned of course so there are some types of terrorism in this case that you can in fact to therapy for but as I said you should have improvements [laughter] doing therapy in order for that to be the case\nUm the the pressure off can give you some relief it won't of course address the underlying reason hopefully the stem cells will be providing some a healing there and and get some repair to that cartilage\nAnd I I'm not a huge fan of braces but um I definitely think it's worth a try and why are you not a huge fan of race um I have some of my own personal reasons one of my reasons I I injured my ankle the worst ever wearing a brace and um there's the braces ... it can give some people false security and it certainly did me\nUm and as an example and to me than he has a rotation component to it and there is no break that can stop rotation move\nAnd so it's not going to stop you from pivoting and tearing your ... and potentially turn your ACL it has been shown\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nCases if I had a an athlete that had an emcee ... and I'm a huge advocate of them wearing a break to get through a season for example um but then I Would want it to the rehab to try to build them up so they don't need it anymore\nWhen you have them and this gets tear ... eventually it will grow back and he looks I don't\nKnow there's a lot of variables there so there's different types of tears and there's different locations and him and this gets to have blood supply a good blood supply and not as good blood supply and so depending on where the terrorists that will determine whether it can actually he'll um there's more research coming out about avoiding surgery and doing exercise through physical therapy or otherwise\nAnd there are some good results but it definitely depends on the type of tear a Eric mentioned the word complex and that makes me nervous mix my belly tour a little bit because those don't typically do well with therapy\nAnd so the other types of tear there's one called the bucket handle and I'd never seen when I should say never but one or two maybe they did okay with the tea most of them don't [noise] so and the nature of the tear\nOur guest today is physical therapists Matthew Good I'm Out the number is eight hundred three for eight to five five one Greg and Northampton Greg you're on\nA ... thanks for taking my call um I have a question about very painful cap injury related to\nRacket sports um [noise] one day I was playing racket sport and maybe a day or so later I felt like my cat was was splitting a from top to bottom very painful to stay off that climbing stairs was nearly impossible yeah yeah I wondered if you had any thoughts about this\nUm [noise] so if there wasn't a specific injury while playing tennis or rack of sport sorry um while playing racket sports than I ... that's a good sign I'm it sounds like the the Patel is the kneecap and then there's a tendency goes over top top culture Patel her tendon\nYou need a compression but yep unique compression because the swelling the race won't help swelling you have to have compression on it and then elevation as well and elevation I think you want to put your foot so points towards this guy so the higher up the foot is the board I have the ... out\nI Do so much of a sudden the minds of Navy SEAL helps as the wages up yep a foot off the ground the whole yeah all that seems to help\nYou need higher so the the higher up just imagine the gravity is pulling the fluid down so you want that foot pointing straight towards this guy\nUm by doing that you'll get a better effect quicker I'm having it up how he described as good but ice a metric contractions to hold it there you're actually contracting the muscle which is going to produce the blood flow a little bit so you want to just sit back and relax with some compression on it and I would recommend that a few times a day\nI'll regarding the hamstring that's that's a little puzzling to me I Would want to investigate a little bit deeper there's a calf muscle that goes back behind the knee as well as your hamstring and what we do in our clinic is quite a bit of manual work to make sure the tissues nice and mobile\nAnd then from there the stretching the hamstring muscle if by for Kate's at the knees so you want to make sure you're stretching both ends of it\nAnd the way you would do that issue would hug you need to your chest or I'm Sorry hug your fight to your chest and then you would straighten your leg out and don't worry if it can't get all the way straight you just straight and as far as you can and you do that with your foot facing straight ahead and then you turn your toe in and you turn your toe out\nAnd do it in multiple times a day until you keep it as mobile as you can for the following day\nYou're getting the exercise I used to get right I mean I I still sort of [laughter] I yeah I Do agree careful\nHey Mike we have to take a break here but just curious where do you find good surfing in Maine\nRhode Island or your age Maine\nOh so you go up on the left side along sent there were

rate graph with you eight hundred three for a few five five one is the number our guest today is physical therapists Matthew Good I'm Out of good I'm a physical therapy in Saratoga Springs three emails and then back to the phones Matt\nThis one is from David I've been diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff I was originally prescribed beat the dentist pain increased I was told to eliminate PT I've also talked to people who have been cured with physical therapy so what is the proper course and that's from David\nUm it it's too hard question to answer because it depends on which muscle the rotator cuff is torn how much of a terror was if it's a full rupture there's not a lot or any physical therapy can do to re attached the muscle however I had a patient that came in and he turned actually two of his rotator cuff muscles and could still use his arm\nHow he did it I'm Still not sure but he did in fact use his arm so\nPhysical therapy shouldn't make it worse than that would signify to me that a there's a partial tear and so it's being loaded a little bit too much\nAnd I would go back to the same things have been saying ah throughout the show here is that I Would do manual work to keep the tissue as mobile as I can make sure I had full range of motion and the joint and then starting on strengthening exercises that did not provoke the tear\nOkay this one is from heart lean I'm eighty years old undeveloped swimmers shoulders last year I've been swimming regularly three times a week\nDoing the crawl starting with an hour but for the last two and a two years a half hour I went for physical therapy for six weeks last winter which helped I Do the pendulum a few times every day I was still swimming what can you recommend first of all what are swimmers shoulders well\nI'm I'm a little suspect of that because of her age I'm Wondering if she has some arthritic changes in there and then I Would also wonder about her her spine position itself so\nIf the shoulders got irritated um I I Would have to I Would just questioning whatsoever shoulder um it's in a nutshell it's just an irritated shoulder from a lot of swimming\nYou know kind of [laughter] explanatory really yeah All right this one is from mark what about carpal tunnel carpal tunnel makes it hard to hold on to dumbbells or ... or even handlebars on a bike please talk about the kind of exercises that a person can do to strengthen the arms despite suffering from carpal tunnel and that's where mark [noise]\nSo the carpal tunnel is right in the middle of the hand and there's a a a with a compression that's happening at the hand when he's putting weight through it is what's irritating to it\nSo the first thing is to mobilize the area um and you do that again with manual therapy stretching type of exercise a strengthening wise you want to build with uh the whole farm area so\nWe would do exercises for both the forearm a Moscow muscle groups which are the expenses and the lectures\nAnd in this kind of case I Would be focused more on the mobility of tissue because the weight bearing end of it which suggests that it's still real irritable and I would want to comment down before I did a lot of strengthening type of things to to help it\nAll right over to Alex in lake ville Connecticut Alex Iran with Matt Good I'm Out\nOf the sufferer phone golfers although a couple of shots or haven't had much effect of the Senate alive or what to do surgery as the recommended it has been\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nLike X rays memorize yes\nOkay did you identity identify any type of carrying on the muscle\n...\nOkay I'm not sure what they would do surgery forward you know what they do surgery for\nA dog\nOkay that would be my first question because if there's nothing to repair and there I'm not sure what they would go in and operate on um golfers elbows that's the tendons that come on the inner part of the arm\nAnd what would I Would recommend is that you want to have um a a manual therapist to work on the forms of your arm to get the soft tissue moving in more mobile um that's the starting point to see if you can comment down with help and help can be again a massage therapist or a physical therapist\nAnd we would use a ... these things like ultrasound and whatnot would I Would be looking for is to try to identify the underlying reason for your pain and and swelling and things like that so if there's not a tear in that area I'm really not sure what they would operate on so I'm a I'm a bit confused on that myself\nOf a ... year like a\nLot for the call Alex and now we go over to David a new ... David you're on\nHer anything short very true and now I'm I Am\nA Seventy six year old male and I am suffer from a ruptured ... by ...\nTendon oh upper left shoulder yeah and uh [noise]\nThey call that the papaya yeah yeah exactly so anyway ah I'm not in pain no they don't recommend any surgery correct and ah [noise] I don't notice any a\nA loss of motion\nNo so the the ... has to tendons that's where the bike comes from and the attendant that tore off basically what happens is the muscle belly comes down to the bottom of the armed that's why the Popeye comes into play\nAnd they really don't offer surgery for this there is no functional reason for it um after the initial injury you give it a little bit of time and then I Would start right into doing exercises or to support the shoulder as well as the elbow the biceps crosses both the shoulder and the elbow so you want to do exercises for that\nStarting off with light type of activities and working on the whole shoulder complex so all the muscles in the back of the shoulder to shoulder blade area as well as the muscles in the front um and just gradually making sure you have a you know your strength returned\nThere might be a diminished meant and strength but it would be a ton it would be a little bit um from comparing left side the right side\nWhat kind of exercises\nWeight bearing yeah exactly you would do exercises just like you would do any type of shoulder exercises in the beginning I Would concentrate more on your technique with things as opposed to getting some dumbbells out I Would use bands for example or I'd have you in specific positions that would challenge you\nAnd then as long as I knew the shoulder was stable and strong than I Would start to add waits to it and it would be simple things like biceps curls but it would also be things like using the shoulder doing shoulder presses and and things like that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Vox Pop", "city": "Albany", "day": "10"}
