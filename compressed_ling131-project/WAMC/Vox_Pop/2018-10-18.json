V. yeah and what it does is it okay it doesn't shift through gear speeds like you're accustomed to okay step on the gas the engine rubs up feeling low lurch and it goes the engine slows down and you're going through increasing gears\nWhere us a constant a variable transmission is seamless it the power comes on and it just glides up in a glide down\nUm industry has used or CDs and snowmobiles and some four wheelers use them they have a belt that drives them so there's no gears shifting anymore okay um so\nTo answer the question about the modes a sport mode keeps the engine revved higher as its up shifting through the rangers so you have more power available or feels like you're celebrating greater which you are\nAnd when you put it in ... in winter it actually does the opposite of sport it loads the engine down makes it shift up faster it robs power from the engine so is to prevent wheel spin and slippery condition okay and the last\nPart of the lock mode yeah lock mode is your ... is yours yours is an outlandish\nSo it's all wheel drive correct yeah the the lock is to uh join your front and rear a dry chefs for optimum traction in bad weather okay so that's a window slippery whether mode now what about the service\nAbsolutely critical so it needs to happen when they say it does\n[noise] uh there's more things in there that are rubbing against each other a so fluid maintenance is very important on a a a variable transmission and the fluid is very expensive um\n... Nissan ... is I think it's a close to thirty dollars huh war okay and so you're meant to be horribly closed is a lot of that expense is the special fluid\nSo do the service when they say absolutely All right norm thanks a lot for the call our number\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com or been western mass Rob Iran\nGentlemen thank you I have a two thousand six not sob nine seven acts the four point to\nWrite recently recently a dashboard light all the gas or light started linking\nRadio going in and out fraud and chewing dealer people actually still service solve out here to enjoy dealer told me I had a module that cost five hundred dollars et cetera plus labor nine hundred dollars total to replace it\nYup had\nA a disgruntled former Chevy mechanic told me to check the ground the wire does that sound reasonable to you well I haven't done that yet\nThere isn't really just one ground wire but yes ground circuits are extremely critical on any component and the lower the voltage some more sensitive it can be to that\nSo we always there were always testing powers and grounds to any module just to be sure it's not that simple\nBut that instrument cluster and that's what they're talking about replacing correct\nOr not the extra cost her it was actually at the bill attract module\nOh what so I thought it was your uh what warning lights were going what what was going crazy on it\nEvery dashboard light was going in and out and I believe that's why the Chevy mechanic thought it might be a short verses Knoxville module going back okay\nBut it's but it's just it's a stability track problem is what has been traced to correct yes so that's the bill attract module ah can be trouble\nAnd\nEarlier versions of that vehicle cars that vehicle is basically a a Chevy Trailblazer yes um had a lot of trouble with the modules getting wet in the location of was on the right I'm a pillar down lower\nA water would seep through the windshield or the body um where the bodies were seemed together and get the ...
