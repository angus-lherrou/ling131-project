lander the New York state\nHistorian and I'm Don Wildman a New Yorker and explore of all things history\nThe basis of this podcast is the New York state museum and the state's capital of Albany established an Eighteen thirty six it is the country's oldest and largest state museum within its walls there are roughly one million cultural objects and more than sixteen million scientific specimens\nAll which helped told a remarkable story of New York and its citizens\nI Believe that not only are they understood relations not only drawn to the worm and\nI sometimes wonder whether people of the world and we have our own hungry and all of our own we align why do we aren't hungry on world\nAs Alfred e Smith the forty second governor of New York said the Empire State has a special place and it can be argued its history is essential when telling the story of the United states of America [noise] we\nThe Empire State has a special place and it can be argued its history is essential when telling the story of the United states of America we hope to make that case through this podcast a New York minute in history and by my side on this journey answer my questions and yours like is the historian for the entire state of New York\nSo Devon what is it about New York and New Yorkers that makes what happened within these fifty four thousand five hundred and fifty five square miles so unique\nWell Don to answer that I Would paraphrase Columbia University's eminent historian kind of Jackson and safe but it happened in New York\nFrom the era quite confederacy through European contact from the Dutch Ford orange through New York's explosion of immigration and diversity New York's history touches on all the major themes of America's history\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm this episode of a New York committed in history will explore the empire states most ambitious engineering feat the Erie Canal\nTransformed upstate New York like I'm pressing time and distance providing the fuel for an explosion of population commerce communication and social change\nBut before this artificial river would slow it was simply an idea touted and anonymous essays written by Jesse Holly in the early Eighteen hundreds as the flower merchant spent months and debtors\nPrison the writings of the so called Hercules grab the attention of a New York politician named dewitt Clinton\nThe idea of the canal spanning the state from Albany to buffalo what would become known it's Clinton's ditch is the most notable impact and his two stints at New York's governor\nBut setting its future success and enormous impact aside why was New York chosen as a place to build what was it the time the nation's largest public works project\nTo answer that let's turn to my colleague at the New York state museum predator he's a senior historian and curator who has been focusing on the Erie Canal for the past four years for a major exhibits celebrating the bicentennial of the canals construction\nSo New York with the logical place for a canal to reach the great lakes was the only state that has a connection to the Atlantic ocean and the great lakes and it's the only complete pass through the mountain chains that get you through to the other side of the Appalachian mountain chain\nThe promise of economic expansion for New York and the people who are already doing business in the region where other contributing factors to determining the waterways location\nThe mohawk valley was fairly settled by the time construction began on the Erie Canal a farming communities and farmers who were able to make use of the river um for trade\nAnd further west not only do you have Native Americans but you have\nPockets of settlements of euro Americans Hugo was was quite a large place already and Kennedy ... buffalo\nI'm and other pockets Geneva had a small settlements not cities per se but there were there were certainly people out euro Americans out in western New York\nAnd um the challenge for them was was trade so you a lot of the farmers certainly in between the the bigger places had um substance farming\nAs opposed to cash crop just growing what they needed um neighbors were were very far apart and those who did try and trade ah found it easier\nWhat they needed um neighbors were were very far apart and those who did try and trade\nAh found it easier and and more economical to trade south through the ... river valley a down to Baltimore in Philly or north to uh Canada through the great lakes\nUm and this was a big factor in the ultimate decision to build the Erie Canal because as I mentioned it was cheaper to trade with everyone but New York city in Albany\nAnd geo political actions involving are young nation also solidified the need for a major trade routes from the eastern seaboard to what was then considered America's west\n[noise] the war of Eighteen twelve was actually a big factor in\nChoosing the root of the canal because the boar front in the early stages of of the war of Eighteen twelve between [noise] the British Canadians and Americans [noise] was on a western frontier of New York state and it was actually\nMore expensive to ship the cannon to buffalo from Albany that was to manufacture that can [noise]\nAnd\nSo transportation to our borders for national defense was lacking and it was extremely hard to for the generals to conduct of war the other factor is as I mentioned earlier it was easier\nFor western New Yorkers to trade with Canada and cheaper and after the war of Eighteen twelve Americans didn't really want to give their business to Canada and we wanted to promote trade from within\nAnd that helped establish that the canal should actually go to Lake Erie and not Lake Ontario ah Lake Ontario would have been shorter\nA it was already an established trade route and it it would have been easier but that factor where that we want to get straight to American territories in American states helped solidify the route to Lake Erie\nBut with such a huge undertaking there had been some debate or hang up not much gets passed in the state or nation without at least some contention\nVery true let's deal with the federal side of that\nCoin first they're actually um we're a couple of efforts in the federal Congress to have\nSurplus funds set aside for internal improvements which would be roads and canals it passed through the Congress only to be vetoed\nBy Jefferson and then Madison are claiming constitutional grounds although New Yorkers would tell you at the time that it was because uh the presidents did not want\nA New York to get an advantage over Virginia\nAnd really they're figuring out big government versus little government what were the roles of the federal government not everyone agreed that the federal government should be building roads\nOr or canals um or or the state governments for that matter so for New York to take this bold step in and say yes we want to\nBuild this canal we're going to raise the funds to do it\nUm they were making a statement that this was was possible under our\nForm of government and when it comes to New York state politics and ways of life upstate and the big apple tend to defer that was true then as it is today so part of the political\nChallenge to making the canal happened was that the more populous areas the Hudson River valley south or New York city in Long Island they were worried that they were going to get taxed to pay for this canal and did not have the trust of the politicians\nLong Island they were worried that they were going to get taxed to pay for this canal\nAnd did not have the trust of the politicians that that wouldn't be the case early on but they're also concerned about especially the the Hudson River valley farmers are concerned about the increase in competition from agricultural products coming from western New York\nLetters of a woman living in upstate New York who was writing to her relatives in Scotland and she was talking about how she was eating ... fresh seafood and she said something along the lines of we're two hundred miles from the sea but distance you know is reduced to nothing here she she made it clear that this this possibility to get sort of the comforts of home\nReally made it much more palatable to move out to the west\nWith the ability to travel and move goods uninterrupted day and night the canal short in time and distance\nThose factors were key to business and profit and wants to waterway was open it provided opportunities for various entrepreneur\nAs bread order up the New York state museum describes New York state was predominantly agricultural based\nAnd when the canal opened and you see a large numbers of immigrants going to Ohio and Michigan\nWhen the canal opened and you see a large numbers of immigrants going\nTo Ohio and Michigan and shortly within a few years their products are coming back\nAnd the grains were cheaper there were often better than what we could do in New York and so agriculturally speaking you've got a transition farmers can no longer compete\nWith the grains coming in it wasn't cost effective\nSo you start to see a transition to um produce apples and dairy products cheese milk\nWhere if you're closer to a city you know you need to provide milk to the city you need to provide she's so New York farmers turned a dairy in and produce as an answer to this\nCompetition or the other thing that happens is you get a large number of industrial centers or or industries that grow because of the canal all of a sudden you can get\nLarge amounts of clay from New Jersey to Syracuse searches has salt all of a sudden you can have stone where and it's easy to ship and you can you can manufacture almost whatever you want it used to be you had to be next to the source only but now you can get things iron ore out of the other on decks\nShipping down to um the capital district where they have large amounts of molding sand so then you have a large foundry industry and the capital district stoves and all sorts of of casting products plows\nAnd the other thing with the transition of agriculture is not to say they weren't growing grains\nBut it wasn't as cost effective to try and compete so you get a different level of it\nBut they also turn to each other in forming a cultural societies their cultural ... society of New York state um and it turned to the science of of of agriculture and\nSo they're trying to figure out ways what's the best kind of plow what's the best kind of fertilizer and this all adds to the industry possibilities along the canal court or and New York state in\nGeneral but with the economic progress came what some consider to be a variety of social ills and dishonest ways of life as Carol sheriff explains\nTo one thing that you would notice that people would write to state officials about the canal they might talk about um how they were very glad to have a law near their farm because that made it possible for them to set up a can outside business which they could where they could serve a vote man and passengers coming through\nBut at the same time they didn't like the fact that workers were congregating there because for many of these middle class religiously oriented people the workers who were coming seem very rough and lose life than she is and they thought that this was a bad influence\nFor their children so they wanted to have the benefits of progress but they didn't want to have what they saw as being a a moral cost of it and I think we see that\nWith the Internet as well that people worry about 'em you know what their children are going to have access to on the Internet\nI think their economic parallels as well people at the time the fact that you're doing business along the canal people you don't know in the previous world you would have had lots of personal interactions with people you were in business with that now you might never meet those people and they would talk about scams that people would [noise]\nYou know they would sell their flower but they were throwing rocks at the bottom of the barrel and so that it would seem to be like they were selling more more flour but they they couldn't really trace these people because that because of the sort of in personality that came along with with the count\nAs jak Kelly describes the promise of independence and the chance to strike it rich on the canal appealed to the younger generation\nThey came along with with a cow\nThat Jack Kennedy describes the promise of independence and the chance to strike it rich and the canal appealed to the younger generations\nLooking backwards we're a little bit deceived by because we have this image of the some men with ... ... ... ... and the ... coats and\nOh that was great great great grandpa back an old man but in fact as you mentioned the people that went out along there right now is not it was not an old man's a racket out there that was it was mostly young people are looking for opportunity looking for something new\nLife was pretty rugged that was the frontier that was the wild west in those days\nSo it attracted young people for example Rochester New York which was on the canal and really it was the first boom town I grew up along the canal they invented the term boom town\nTo apply to Rochester when it was booming three quarters of the people that live there were under thirty so it was really a youth movement or some people compared to the Nineteen sixties America's youth culture is very prominent\nAnd um I think just like young people in any age they were more open to change more open to spirituality they were they were searching as young people were in the sixties searching for something new something exciting something that was emotionally gripping\nThe canals merging of the young population new communities a rapidly changing way of life and the faster method of communication was fertile ground for reform movements highlighted the second great awakening\nTheory can we think of it is a great work in progress and it was but there were a lot of\n... to that progress and people were concerned about that they want to have the benefits of progress but they didn't want to have the cost of it and so I think they often turn to um you know to movements that allow them to improve society to perfect themselves in a religious sense to perfect others or bring perfect ability\nTo others and then I think just the canals opening up of\nNot just the commercial highway is that but also in a way for ideas to move there were many reformers he traveled you through the area they were tracks religious newspapers people who travel along the canal boats stopping at different towns to to try to to bring their ideas there\nAnd I think you know in a very little literal sense and allow for the movement of ideas\nAnd uh there was a great a movement back to religion I think partly because the constitution had not only guaranteed the freedom to exercise religion but it had ban the establishment of religion\nAnd the ... and those days not taken taxpayer money and paying the clergy and supporting the church in every town\nSo once that idea of an established church government authorized and sponsored church was gone there was a suddenly a big market for relations like anybody could start a religion all you had to do is attract enough followers\nThey would contribute to you and you you have your religion and going towards it opened up um opportunities for both very sincere people and people that were a little bit more marginal on the\nMargins of Charlotte and has them to start their own religions and to appeal to the\nMasses of people and see if they could get followers and\nA lot of people did it and particularly along the Erie Canal where people were moving into the frontier of moving away from the established traditions of New England and ah we're more open to the to these new ideas\nOne of the best known preachers at the time\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nThis church and studied to become a license minister and the Presbyterian Church\nWhen the Erie Canal opens in Eighteen twenty five he travels along it holding revival is rallies that drew thousands\nMany of these communities in the western end of the canal and that's really where there was kind of hot bed and spiritual and send them perform mindedness and what was called the burned over district famously name by Charles Fannie and he talked about how there have been so many fires in the evangelical revival isn't that the area was burned over\n... often preach themselves into exhaustion spreading his message in raising his public profile many saw the preachers teachings as a means to salvation and morality\nLeaders in the boom town of Rochester witness to drinking and other believed social wrongs invited Finney to reignite religious fervor in the city\nWhen there was this upsurge in some new religion going on\nFinney was sort of the middleman between the really wild frontier versions of Christianity\nAnd the various stayed and and traditional puritan Calvinist New England version\nHe had the ability to excite a lot of emotion to give a bit of an impression of heaven hell and Bible stories and so forth with this preaching and became you know developed techniques of a restrained emotion I Would put it that way\nThat was carried on by evangelists and revival is all the way down to Billy Graham\nSending would go on to promote the abolition of slavery and equal education rights for women and African Americans\nWhile Finney was a trained preacher one of the periods most striking religious movements came from a far more unlikely source\nAs a conspiracy theory and it was cited by Richard ... is a historian ... later on he cited this as an example of what he called the paranoid style\nOf American history that the people had had jumped onto this conspiracy theory and it was somewhat like in his time was the McCarthy Era of hysteria finding communist around every corner\nSo um it was a remarkably long lived phenomenon in the sense that fifty some years later they put up a monument in Batavia which is we're Morgan had lived a huge pillar and statue of Morgan as murder to free speech\nFor trying to write this book and then being probably killed for doing so\nThe Morgan highlights how the spread of information change because of the canal\nBoth through its influence and its intention\nAmerica had always had a pretty high level of literacy\nBut uh if you go back to the time of the revolutionary war it was just paper was expensive of printing books was expensive and they were sort of the the um circulated mainly among people that were wealthy\nBy Eighteen twenties and thirties the price of newspapers in books and so forth had dropped considerably\nSo um they became a vehicle for information or we think today of ah the various newspapers or Web sites or whatever whatever you're considering that are politically biased\nNewspapers in those days and through much of American history newspapers were very biased and there was a man in Rochester named furlough weed\nAnd he was a a newspaper publisher and also a political operator he was sort of a um the Karl Rove of his day and\nHe latched onto the antenna sonic movement and changed the name of his paper to the ... or whatever it was and became a whole hearted proponent of anti Semitism\nAnd helped with the clerk formation of the political party and so forth there were dozens of anti ... newspapers in different towns around first in western New York and an farther afield\nSo there was um information available and ... and moved quickly or because of the canal they were able to get word from New York to buffalo in a matter of days instead of months so that would have been just a little bit earlier\nTalk about new ideas\nSupport for streaming WAMC comes from the Davis financial group providing the base financial planning and wealth management services to individuals families and business owners and the pioneer valley and beyond Davis financial G. R. P. dot com\nAs we dug into the impact of the Erie Canal the parallels between the worldwide Web and the waterway continue to avail themselves so\nWe've spoken to a number of historians who obviously you've told us about what happened in the past I think it's time to look into the present and dig further into those parallels [noise]\n[noise] I'm ... I'm the director of the Institute for data exploration and applications at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\n[noise]\nNow before professor handler makes the connection between the Internet and the Erie Canal let me just interject with is interesting though RPI intro in New York just north of Albany is described as the oldest technological University in the English speaking world\nNow remember there were no civil engineering schools in America when they started building the Erie Canal well the school and the banks of the Hudson started producing the country's first civil engineering degrees and Eighteen thirty five coincidence I think now\nSo what happened in both cases you had some visionaries who looked ahead and said we need to be able to go somewhere we can go now and we need to get there fast\nAnd then what happened is as that infrastructure started coming in case of the canal when it was starting to get finished when people were starting to really start to move the first boats on it\nPeople realize they can do a lot more than was originally and vision so I think the early days of the Web was going to be something that was actually even e commerce was being debated were we going to be able to buy things on it hard to believe [noise]\nNowadays but it was really seen as just a way to make people across the world able to talk together faster\nLike the Erie Canal the Internet and the world Wide Web created opportunities few imagined when they were being built\nSo you know there's an old saying in science that anytime you can make something ten times faster you can change it drastically\nI think the surprise in the Web was just how much it could be used for\nDifferent things both positive and negative so you know now most of the money on the Web is being made by advertising actually in the early days it was pornography but meanwhile is creating the business that eventually became Amazon than thanks so it was used for many many different things in what\nOriginally the assumption was that was going to be sort of like television very few people most people would just sit and watch stuff and then very quickly it became clear that it was it was really exactly about ease of\nUse of doing stuff I could buy something faster I could look at more things I could go check out things and then as it became social networks and picture sharing and messaging it it's just all about faster communication how soon can I get something to someone\nIn a way that I used to not be able to and like the second great awakening social media has created and or fueled movements that likely never would have happened if not for their rapid distribution via the Internet you know becoming famous for being famous almost in in a way that I'm told the the canal did\nAnd some of the really interesting things we see on the Web what we also often referred to as a viral video or viral means something for ... for no one's quite sure why are doing well in the early days those red containment\nBut then they started becoming more meaningful when and whole movements grow around that look at um [noise] you know sort of it was first used to watch for getting people out them into physical sciences but then you have things like black lives matter and things that we're just the social media impact\nYou know sort of it was first used a lot for getting people out and into physical space but then you have things like black lives matter and things that we're just the social media impact of being able to see things\nThat had been going on for a long time and now suddenly not only could you see one but you can see lots of them from any place that I have a feeling you had that same kind of\nFunneling effect now suddenly coming through the canal on either end was a lot of information from a lot of different places that the other side\nAnd that that bringing it together really is something new and on the Web of course that's around the whole world\nBut it can be in your neighborhood lot of discussion nowadays requires things like fake news and stuff like that and again once you got that communication then people can start putting up their messages which may not be the same as your messages religions can spread in ways they\nCouldn't before a small group of people who might have lived in different towns along the canal can suddenly now be in touch with each other and form a group\nOr a ... and we see that kind of thing on the Web is this group formation this ability of\nThings that that you know those are the bad part with him in some ways and some what we're trying to explore how to change is you know people can communicate about anything including things you don't like and you know people can get move a in those days physically here now more [noise]\nA character assassination reputation and all those things really changed very rapidly because of the fast [noise]\nSophie\nCovered how the Erie Canal reshaped upstate New York and the country but what happened to the canal itself I mean people in goods don't travel by barge any more\nTo turn back to the historians first up is Brad under the New York state museum so as soon as the canal open completely from Albany to buffalo there were already calls for hey let's make it bigger\nIt was an immediate success they can now assume choked with boats boats long lines at locks\nAnd so as the revenues were coming in they said okay we we can invest in making a larger in Eighteen thirty six they started the first in March of the canal so you've got the original which people refer to as Clinton stitch\nAnd then the enlarged canal starts in Eighteen thirty six in the large sections as they went I was not completed and or declared complete until Eighteen sixty two due to political and financial wranglings if you will\nReally second half of the nineteenth century railroad is becoming very strong\nVery strong opponent to the canal and they started to control prices that they bought up warehouses along the canal system especially in Buffalo New York city and they made it difficult to ship I can now these are the robber barons of the railroad um however\nThe one thing that saved the canal or one of the things to save the canals that\nPeople saw the canal as a check\nOn the monopoly that the railroad was gaining so the railroad had the advantage of lower prices during the boating season to match the canal and inject them up in the winter time to make their different sort of make money in Eighteen Ninety eight a governor",
