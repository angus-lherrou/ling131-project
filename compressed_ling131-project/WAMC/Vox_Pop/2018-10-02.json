the Supreme Court and the Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd before we get to the next call gentlemen or a previous caller TJ wanted to know about the possibility of maybe sixty six votes for a lifetime appointment\nSounds good to me but there's another issue and that is the the issue of what the majority party thinks its obligation is I think Rehnquist was as extreme a justice as we've had a ...\nAnd actually he would be All right along with the extreme conservatives now ah and yet the Democrats lead them through\nA and they were in control they didn't they didn't need more than a simple majority to stop them\nSo so there are a couple of issues but I think it makes a lot more sense and and we've also aggregated the the filibuster rule which is why it's possible to do with the uh I say we read the new yeah well I I didn't write him okay uh\nBut that's that's what sets this up\nThough I think we're in a you know you mentioned rent question although the votes ... originally nominated and somewhat fewer when he's elevated to chief justice when there's a little more controversy he'll controversy over Antonin Scalia at the same time\nI mean we're in a much different era now than we were even in Nineteen eighty six eighty seven\nAnd I think that the kind of positive view of what happens if you move to sixty six votes is that it forces the president and the assuming the president and the Senate or in controlled by the same party the majority party to nominate someone more moderate who would secure a number of votes from the minority party\nThe the kind of ... that the evil scenario where the problematic scenario is that leads us to just perpetual gridlock and there's a tension here between wanting justices who are um acceptable to a broad range of American society and wanting to give a majority party wanting to give democracy small D democracy it say so\nThis is going both ways obviously Democrats killed the filibuster for everything about Supreme Court nominations than Republicans or give it back to them and kill the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations to get Gorsuch through\nHeightening the or in in Hansing the number of votes required would theoretically move us toward more moderate and acceptable justices it might just as well or crippled the nomination process even further\nI've also heard it said in connection with the appointment of judges on the state court or the the court of appeals that a similar obligation of trying to find the people acceptable across the board basically kills out the best of both sides\nKind of new tissue and forces you to pick mundane uninteresting people in the middle there are a variety of state proposals on this Washington state of Washington for years\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAt that works when politics aren't sufficiently polarized as politics polarized more and more and Republicans are more conservative and Democrats are more liberal and further apart from one another and that sort of meet in the middle find someone acceptable to both sides becomes more and more difficult\nBefore we get to Mike into Windsor my question for you or I'm like well this is Michael Michael being actually the ... the nine justices on the court now FDR famously or infamously tried to add more and\nDidn't go over all that well oh it went over very well but not\nFor the reasons that are not the simplistic did he get those extra\n... All right so we go now to battle in the war is hang on chancellor let let let me from rising here what is the mechanism in other words let's say a in two years a very liberal president takes over and he says well we've got this conservative majority now I Want to add a couple of more what is the mechanism for doing that\nIt is purely statutory the number of Supreme Court justices is not set in the constitution and the number of justices over the ... over the course of history\nHas ranged from five on the low side to actually ten on the high side so it is purely a matter of law that the house on the Senate would have to pass on the president would have to sign think it was ten honor Lincoln but I'm not I don't get in there was one right right after the right after the civil war there was an attempt they they reduced at four it was actually granted they reduced it for\nA Johnson and an increased it for for granted what's the minimum\nThere is no minimum who could be one it could be more on the constitution specifies names each that there is a chief justice side it states otherwise says nothing about how many individuals need to sit on the Supreme\nCourt All right let's go to the phones now Mike into Windsor is really been waiting a long time Mike Iran\nNo problem guys I've enjoyed listening listen I just want a free face this by saying my interest in the Supreme Court is brand new\nI haven't really started paying attention ... until the whole Merrick Garland situation and stuff and this may be a dumb question I'm just hoping he can help me is there anything in the constitution about the lifetime terms of these guys\nGet us I don't know it's somewhat new to it I just think maybe that's part of the problem in part of the why we have so much in hiding and all this stuff\nThat I don't know maybe down sorry\nNo no it's not as important the constitution says that they're pointed for good during good behavior in other words they did the constitution makes it lifetime unless they're impeachable basically okay\nCom up till now go ahead and now you first your first I was hooked\nUp with the question we had an email are there any circumstances under which the judge can be deemed unfit to sit on the bench illness in LT reckless behavior illegal activity\nAnd then what happened well again it's not that's not even statutory a and there have been attempts to impeach justice is I think the first attempt was in the administration that was a Jefferson yet during it was chased justice chase right All right Mike you want to follow up there who committed the Senate being a federal\nRight and engaging in the Democrat Republican you hello\nYou guys I'm I'm a little younger at this so I'm just gonna say like I hear a lot in my generation the rumblings of just term limits in all across the board with the Senate and I just think may be as you know the old guard starts go maybe ... the young guys might be thinking about a change I'm gonna hang up a list and thank you got so\nThank you Mike we appreciate the call our number here is eight hundred three for eight to five five one term limits is a proposal that a lot of people have have suggested there isn't a lot of law professors over the last decade or so who have proposed these ideas one popular one has been Eighteen year terms that justices will each served eight\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nEvery two years that would guaranteed to each president who has a four year term to appointments to the court what about age limits New York has age limits the the Supreme Court does not um and in fact some justices have gone on to advanced age including beyond the point that some of their colleagues thought they were capable of serving\nA age limits is something that that people have talked about it's not clear that Egypt is the key problem on the court John Paul Stevens served admirably to an advanced age ... Ginsberg ... yup ...\nAnd then over the weekend I Wish it was on the court or there was a a William Kennedy and he's Ninety\nOkay let's go back to the phones eight hundred three for eight to five five one Fred in Sullivan county Fred\nYeah I I write a gentleman when ... when you are being that there is no statute of limitations I think this may be a solution to put this nomination to an abrupt close ah it's been reported that the state of Maryland has no statute of limitations for the alleged crimes by coming\nOn and I think that both the Christine Bugsy forward and also Deborah Ramirez have a good case\nThe reason that people some people have been more concerned about Kavanaugh with regards to what Arthur is talking about and what he's talking about is that Kavanaugh's career\nThrough American politics has been as effectively a Republican Party operative phrase so he was a staff secretary to George W. Bush he was a member of the Justice Department at worked for for Ken Starr during the Clinton investigation\nYou then was nominated to the to the DC circuit by by George W. Bush when he was unanimously\nApproved ... I remember that that might well be so uh but that Kavanaugh has a resume that looks more\nEntrenched in party politics than justices have had all the late ... earlier points in American history there were justices that were that were total partisans and were appointed to the court in part because of that role but of late since the Nineteen sixties seventies\nWe have since after Ford us presidents have moved toward it stopped being nominees are proposing nominees who are more on the legal side who were judges first and had less of a clear\n...
