the minute cheap but this one came in via email from Alex in late them\nAnd Alex writes I used to live in Michigan for a couple of years before returning to the capital region my question is when it comes to policing what differences have you noticed between Southfield out of here and what from your past experiences in Southfield are going to help you with the police culture and the Albany or are we touched on this but could you could expound\nKnow what I found to be interesting is that a police work is the same no matter where you are in the country and um my first couple of weeks that I was here in Albany out that it was nothing too much changed in terms of dealing with people in terms of the challenges that we see in in law enforcement the challenges that we see in communities um\nSo things are are are pretty much the same in in that respect and I think what I can bring from Michigan to Albany is a ... ... it just a different set of eyes you know when you bring somebody who's who's experienced things in a different kind of way and you're in you're in a different part of the country\nI mean you kinda see things a little bit different and uh it it I found that true even back in Michigan because um when I was a newer police officer we brought in and outside police chief chief it did it come from it was within the state Michigan not cause resentment\nYou know I I think it can it can if if the approach that right in a in one of the things I learned from that she that came in from the outside in mind that the the ... department\nOr was that it's very important for new chief or new executive any body going into it in an organization in a leadership position to listen to listen very very closely listened intently to what's happening in the organization people people want to feel that someone comes from the outside truly\nHas has a has has is that desire\nTo hear some of the challenges in to take some of those things in and help them to take to get through some of these things and so uh so when I came in\nTo hear some of the challenges in to take some of those things and and help them to take to get through some of these things and so uh so when I came in I might not even now you know I'm Still in in the face while listen a lot to\nPeople both within the organization in those outside of the organization\nThe good news is you can still use your snow tires here [laughter] I'm sure you will yes they're very very soon All right let's go back to the phones eight hundred three for eight to five five one is number chief Eric Hawkins is our guest today ... bill your next\nOf a few months back a few weeks back a curse laid off from the guardian angels came up to try to assist Albany police for this a problem that you're having with the violence and you know I'm not a member of the organization or they had just wanted to know what your take is on that visit and\nAny future you might have with that organization\nYeah thank you for that question and and and I think that\nUh from from the outside looking in because I was monitoring what was happening from Michigan when the when Mr Slater was here in Albany and a first impressions were that he meant well\nIt it looked on the surface that he had a a genuine desire to help other members of the Albany community deal with some of the violence that was occurring in the community\nBut what I saw was maybe a flaw in his strategy with the heat it didn't it didn't appear at least from the outside looking in that he worked closely first with the stakeholders in the community and in crafting is the sort of a response to some of this violence\nAnd that caused some resentment because it it it seemed as if it appeared that he would simply imposing a ... style hey a law enforcement ... reaction on to a community and what I've seen in my almost three decades and police work\nIs that if you ... that it is\nSometimes it's a fundamentally flawed ah approach to impose a ... to impose impose a law enforcement strategy on the community and it seems like that's what he was doing and it and it and it created some resentment people did not want to listen so in other words you're saying it created a resentment in the community and not the police force [noise]\nI don't think so much in the police force I I think that the police officers you know they they understood I think that you know this person you know had a genuine interest in in helping the community get through some of the the violence\nBut uh I I think that the people who are being served\nRight in right now in in law enforcement you know one of the things that we've learned in law enforcement ... over the last um especially the last ten or Fifteen Years is that\nUm we did is a fundamentally flawed strategy to impose a law enforcement strategy on the community have to work with the community work with the steak other stakeholders the the elected officials\nThe local police department um the members of the residents and visitors in their community in order to craft a style that that's unique for that particular community\nI confuses me a little bit when you say a style I mean the law's the law though right I mean if you break the law than the law comes to get you yeah but\nWay that it's being policed is different in every community\nGive me an example if you could ah for example and some in some communities the um you know they they want the police department to to work with them in in in order to to develop a strategy for addressing some issues you have other communities who may say well we understand what\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've ... in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for what three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nYou know the best we can uh so you have those nuances in in communities but one common thread though I'm that we've been seeing across the country is that hardly any of the communities one simply to be had to have a a law enforcement style imposed on them\nAnd I think that it was perceived by the members of the new community ... at least my perceptions of the you know from the outside looking in\nIs that the they perceived his style is being ... he was imposing a law enforcement style on them critically correct in instead of coming in working with working with the community you know to say okay what are some of the challenges what what if some of your fears some of your concerns with ideas do you have\nYou know connecting with the police department in a formal way connecting with our ... our our local elected officials to see what challenges in things they were seen as fair level and then after talking with these\n... these different stakeholders in the community then develop a way of addressing the problem so I think from the outside looking in ... that may have been a fundamental problem um with him at that time when he came into Albany\nWhat it says is that an organization that is transparent an organization that is willing to to have some sort of public accountability\nAnd I think it ... it I I I've always said even before the body cameras became prevalent in law enforcement always said that body cameras are our behavior modern fires\nAre both the ... both the resident or the person that the officer is is working with they modify their behaviors when they noted there are being recorded and also the officers\nYou know I mean if if there's ... there's an officer who may have thought that maybe there's a waiver comment that could have been made or or something like you know those things are avoid it as well so in terms of modify behaviors I think the great I think the great in terms of ... I'm looking at incidents after afterwards so that we can\nUh you know determine best practices in dealing with things\nI think they're a great tool they're great technological to\nAlbany police chief Eric Hawkins is our guest our number here on Fox Pop is eight hundred three for eight to five five one eight hundred three for eight to five five one we'll be right back [noise]\nMm [noise] um\n\n[noise]\nI'm\nAn\nSupport for WAMC ... agricultural stewardship association\nHelping people can serve farmland in the upper Hudson Valley we can serve good farmland for good forever ha stewardship dot org Chester common table main street Chester, Massachusetts locally sourced comfort food beers life had cocktails live music every Friday Chester common table dot com\nCareers and transition L.
