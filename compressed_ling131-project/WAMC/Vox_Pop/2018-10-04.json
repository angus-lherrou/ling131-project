though I don't know I don't remember a let's go to the phones eight hundred three four to five five one Mike in Walden Mike you're on\nBoth Howard that I got\nA right to question about the opposition of all the planets and all that the solar system in the universe wise everything All right what what created that to be the shape and everything yeah why no cube shaped\nPlanets well that's because the sphere\nHappens to have the smallest surface of any geometric shape it starts with that or you'll see where I'm going to go with us and we learned that when we were kids and we had clay they handed this quake we learned early on that if you could Patty cake it flat you could make a big sheet\nA big like fried egg sheet of of that clay but if you made it into a ball between your hands the ball would be the smallest ... so if we were going to let it dry and then painted you'd need the least amount of paint\nIf you made that into a ball than into any other shape\nSo the same way you have a blob of any material in space if it's big enough is this massive enough it it'll have its own self gravity that it'll start pulling itself to the smallest possible shape and the smallest possible shape as a sphere in other words only a sphere\nHas the surface closest to the center than any other shape a cube has some points that are sticking out further from the from the center than other areas and that would be pulled in\nUntil it was turned into a ... a global sphere as oil has to be the ... so it has to be able only if you have enough mass and that's why the low mass objects like certain asteroids and comets nuclei and things like that they can be a regular potato shape any any shape if they're small\nBut it's when you get to a certain amount of ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nClimate have enough mass ... does have enough have enough mass you're going to automatically be a ball and that applies to stars and planets moons anything for\nMike where are you there is All right hey I appreciate that they very much\nThanks for the call at what is that magic number of the math math yeah\nUm well I could give you the mass of of Pluto but I don't know what exactly it is I I don't have all these things that I had I not all of them have the the minimum ... but some of the er about somebody at home\nI bet you the number here is eight hundred three for eight to five five one Bob ... is our guest eight hundred three for eight to five five one I saw on the news oh this week maybe earlier this week they've landed very small\nRovers on an asteroid you see this a good use ... on a Japanese rocket and these little they dropped the uh the bouncing sort of a hopping a probe onto an asteroid what do you learn you can tell what's an asteroids made out of [noise]\nYeah I got the ... but you know when we talk during the breaks and stuff you know what turns me on about discoveries and it's it's not planets non asteroids that's strange stuff right\nAnd uh unfortunately very few discoveries about that a namely what I feel I mean it just leap away for black okay All right I Know you're saying here it goes it is starting in the twenties when the quantum theory gang Heisenberg in news born all the others\nWere starting to do experiments that show that the observers a\nKnowledge changed the results so that was the first step towards what increasingly is looking like there is some connection between\nOur awareness our consciousness and the material universe now this is not yet standard science generally this kind of considered airy fairy stuff by by scientists but this more and more indications\nThat the universe from the beginning from the big bang may not have been primarily a material thing in other words\nThe the fundamental truth of the universe being matter\nAtoms and molecules and rocks and stuff like that from which came\nLife and then consciousness but rather consciousness may be a fundamental thing now you know I live near Woodstock so yeah oh yeah and it shows [laughter]\nYeah but but as as experiments are done new versions done in Brazil of the double slit experiment in other ways that are that are indicating how this may tied together to me that's\nThat that that really gets my how consciousness ties in with the universe I mean there's a new book by mark ... that I think is the farthest out of all kind of give you the premise fine I mean all I did was ask about asteroids but go right ahead [laughter]\nI Know why go ahead go ahead [laughter] I Know so that's all right okay yeah yeah is this okay what if\nIt's true that consciousness or awareness is\nFundamental on prime all in the universe and that is always exists in other words it's eternal just like you you're always conscious of something they're always aware of something we're all a rather large leap ... okay so we're always aware of something so what if awareness is a permanent state\nAnd one of the brains function is not to create consciousness 'cause no one's ever figure out how the brain could create countries is what if the what the brain does is it focuses\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nIs has a consciousness experience that's appropriate for that organism cat dog us as humans we had consciousness that is appropriate for us as human beings if that's true then the brain is not needed for consciousness that actually kind of restricts consciousness and that would be\nA give you the good news that may be on a pond death when the brain dissolves\nYou don't lose their sense of experience or awareness but actually maybe you're free to into the larger experiences ... ... talk about of a you know cause my consciousness and maybe that explains why studies you probably didn't know this is really pull in labs given psychedelic\nDrugs and having these so called mystical experiences\nHave always been found to have reduced brain function at that time\n[noise] interesting art I withdraw the question about the asteroids or you know ... or ... or ... or so our brain is basically then he a band pass filter yes fascinating let's go back to the phones in hope things improve a re in Massachusetts right Iran\nYes I'm here just gave an example of nine times any number from one to nine\nOr any number could be millions no don't limited to one to nine and could be nine times or anything in the billions and it'll still add up tonight\nOkay my next okay what other mathematical a column tricks that\nSo there is no edge of the interests oh there is a definite edge to the universe but it's\nIt's sort of a different one there's a a because of this expansion there is a distance which things are rushing away at the speed of light that distances Thirteen point eight billion light years from us at that distance from us things are\nRushing away a light speed and therefore the light from everything from that point on where it can can never get here so it means we have two universes with a sharp boundary everything closer than that point is within view Mm war can someday be seeing\nEverything beyond that point which might be almost every part everything of the universe we don't know because we have no clue because we can never never see it\nRepresents the real universe beyond so we have the observable universe where you might call it the visible universe then you have this boundary and then beyond that is the measure universe or the or or most of the University in fact recent evidence from a just a three and a half years ago\nShows us that that area beyond it's at least ten thousand times larger than what's within you know they're going to that because this team in Berkeley survey nine hundred thousand galaxies with better within view that's the only thing we can see\nAnd they found that the um the ah apology of space up to this point shows no curbing\nAnd so that indicates that what's beyond is far far far more than what's between there and here right and from there they can imply the ratio of what's beyond to what we can see that ratio comes out to be\nI mean it's so large that there are some ... just the thing that that thing beyond may be infinite\nRight okay well we have the universe round like the earth as universe around well\nAgain we can say nothing about that thing that goes beyond but it would be hard to picture anything that wasn't a symmetrical and that way yeah\nAll right Andrew we have to take a break here we are a little over do our number is eight hundred three for eight to five five one eight hundred three for eight to five five one Bob permanent is here and we'll be back with the home stretch\nSupport comes from grades in grains wine and stare teach
