well I Would have been happy to wait and something going on I\nHave two questions on my first question is I have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone\nIt's an older one uh you know it's a small form that it's not one of these giant things I absolutely love it I use it for email texting calling it with me and since I got it I don't use a computer\nI use this exclusively on my question is regarding email I'd ask many of my friends that apparently they know as little as I Do that no one can answer me on\nWhen you accumulate emails on your smartphone or they held like in a cloud and then when you access your email um when you when you\nPull up your email they are then retrieved and are accessible through your phone or are they all your phone\nAnd that's a great question because I did because I had so many and I don't spend\nAny time eliminating them and my thought is that if there isn't a phone the phone would have blown up\nBy now [laughter] All right gentlemen what do you think\nUm I actually have a have a Samsung Galaxy for myself I'm so depending on the set up typically when you set up email on the phone the emails to get download it on\nJuly only happened Gmail I never set up email I use Gmail exclusively\nSo if you if you're just using a using that the the um uh chrome browser to go to Jean ... dot com and look and look at your email then those are not download it to your to your

to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nOh so there isn't the answer to that one now I'll tell my friends have run and my other question is I had this phone for about two and a half years as I said it's my\nConstant ... canyon and ah I use it for everything and it is beginning to do some peculiar sayings and and my question is is it time for me to get a new battery it lacks shot and then it and then I\nTurn it I I if I Can't do anything and then I just put the falling down and five minutes later it displays the salmon some things you know when it's working again and John ... it's doing things like that and when it's in that lord I Can't turn it off and I didn't do anything but then it comes back\nIt sounds like it might be time to start shopping for a new phone just based on the age oh it it may be the battery but in case like that where it seems to restart on its own I Would probably yield to are considering a new\nPhone oh boy oh I'm Sorry Harry we gave me one good answer and one Batman but the thank you for calling refers you had this one came in via email is ... is also about a Samsung\nAnd this is from Doug in Massachusetts I keep two separate email accounts my Gmail I use for business at work or personal email that I use with all my friends family center is Yahoo\nReasonably it got a new Samsung Galaxy smartphone for work\nAnd when I logged into my Google Account it automatically sync my Gmail and my Yahoo mail is there any way to want to do this I've noticed since this happened that I've been receiving friends suggested is on Facebook which is tied to buy Yahoo account\nFor my co workers I can only assume that some of my co workers are seeing friends suggested for some of my shall we say unsavory Paige pulled friends\nAnd that's when the dog okay can you want to do it\nTo you on duty emails set up yes it does make you yeah you can we move to sink um the I think what what what happened is when you first get your\nGet your phone or just because an joy based it's going to when you log in to to log in to the um to to enjoy a coup who has a\nSystem and and and typically eat that stuff gets back from the old phones so he thinks that you just replace your phone and then once we start everything so there's nothing wrong there it's pretty logical but you can definitely stop the sinking that we moving your accounts off the off the phone off the he wants to take notes on the phone\nHe he wants to have his Gmail and his Yahoo but he doesn't want them to intertwined\nIn other words you've got to do phone right says Yahoo mail is his friends is unsavory towels on Facebook whatever they may be dog we're not casting any kind of the we're not making any sort of a judgment on you but the Gmail is for business he needs them both on his phone\nHow do you make them separate but equal\nCan you use a separate Gmail app by no on the apple phones they have a Gmail lap and the Yahoo at
