seems like it would be overcome so I feel like less is better I'm I'm more concerned about ticks at this stage than I Am fleas really I I personally like the rest of the color\nFeel less is better and I'm I'm more concerned about ticks at this stage than I Am fleas really I I personally like the rest of the color\nFor that's what that's what we use high value like you for reminding me we are now at the seven eight months oh the new one and we're right in the middle of like a yes this is the time that heavy\nAlright so this one is from Alex in ways I'm just yesterday and my grandmother was flying to Florida for the winter and couldn't get her cat on the cat carrier in time and had to leave her without her in order to make her plane\nUh now I'm watching the cat and wondered if you have advice on a safe a natural way to calm the cat to get into the carrier rather than giving it a sedative also can you fly a cat by itself [laughter] from Alex in late\nAlex I Do not know the rules and find cats on their own however um which you could try is one thing that ... there's a couple of things you could get a spray that's a pheromone called feel away\nBut that's more like for the long term game I'm thinking short term a drop of lavender essential oil yeah spreads of rescue remedy and like thirty seconds later in\nThe grill yeah so you don't recommend say kitty value so if you're like oh you know that can actually freak them out more some really yeah but that's at that would definitely be a backup but since he was asking about not\nNatural no kind of very much that's your game didn't want to hear from Kim I Am fostering some kittens for local animal shelter\nAnd we discovered that one of the kittens as ... structure shelter said there was probably nothing we can do about it and hopefully the kitten will outgrow it also this kitten happens to be an odd I cat years one new one green are there are two parts of my question one\nTo feed this kitten I'm having to make a flurry of high calorie food and powder kitten formula because you cannot tolerate anything to particulate\nI Am concerned about nutrition is there any anything you can suggest to improve his calorie intake that's the first question\nOkay so the first question boys to bad actors who's not here because she's a de right up her alley but I Would say add a little bit of fat to the diet so I'm a little bit of coconut oil or I'm probably coconut will be the best thing ah just because it's got some nice other effects to it and just be set up that way but\nNow I think I think that's about all you can do at this point\nOkay and the second question is there any treatment you can suggest to alleviate district\nMm [noise] no not really a that's a tough one because you know for certainly in terms of what I Do which is deal with unusual things when you have a structural issue\nUm you know functional medicine doesn't always shines and this is a structural problem I don't know if a touch of acupuncture would work I've never worked you know worked on a kitten that small before Joe I'm always willing to try those things because I always feel like it's you know worth a shot but especially when there isn't anything else to to go with it but I'm\nI'm going to have to let that once that for a minute but I don't I'm not thinking of anything off the top of my head for that\nYou know you study this a long time and acupuncture seems to have a good track record in in veterinary medicine and yet it seems that seems to be that random chance like it'll work on some and others are\nNot work why I think a lot of times when it doesn't work you have a structural issue and and it may be undiagnosed um it a lot of times it's used inappropriately you know I have really learned to give my clients are realistic\nUm some realistic expectations of it because sometimes it is just this is all we can do let's just hope for the best and a lotta times like when little recalled with you love and a half year old dog from Lennox Matt\nI'm I Know that dog is going to respond beautifully to acupuncture 'cause this is what I Do is just you know older dogs and I watch the clock to turn back stay stable for a while so\nIt's a lot of it has its case selection and just knowing who is really probably going to respond and who isn't and then for everybody else just saying let's just hope let's just give it a shot\nA lot of it as its case selection and just knowing who is really probably going to respond and who isn't and then for everybody else is saying let's just hope let's just give it a shot but a lot of times there are structural diseases that are behind it\nOf course now is is our guest today on touch with rats and now back to the phones John in Windsor is a janitor yawn\nNotes Ken Hi John you're on\nOkay thank you thank you for taking my call and Dr Dallas I'm Wondering if you are familiar with the Quito pet sanctuary\nYes I Am actually I had to pause for a minute but yes I Am and I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on putting dogs on you know ... or you know die before you yeah so it's a cute Jenna diet\nIs a a very it's a it's a high fat diet um it accentuate fat as your source of calories versus proteins and I'm\nJan I'll tell you you know this is new enough for me that I Am in the watch and wait mode with it um it makes sense to me um you know I use a mostly raw diet for my patients I'm so it's heading towards the Quito diet as it is\nUm my clients are amazing and they do tons of research\nAnd several of them have brought it to me and I had told them you have my blessing I feel comfortable with you try and get especially for cancer patient um it seems to make sense to me I have not seen any ill effects from it but I'm not in a place where I'm recommending it yet just because it's new and I I Am\nHesitant to jump on new bandwagon until there's some some history behind it but I Love that people are a little more\nUm you know innovative ... and early adopters of this type of thing and I feel like if I'm making the suggestions I have to be a little bit more conservative about it but I'm really open to certainly and it it does make sense to me I worry about the ... so I Will say that\nI worry about a dog's pancreas and I feel like if they're going if we're going to use it we have to go slowly not to shock the pancreas\nOkay yeah that that that diet I mean they offer a diet plan based on your dogs age and wait and an activity and you literally measure things out and grab yeah I Know and um you know I've met us before I brought my husky tier office\nOh okay yeah and I felt so\nI I was starting to put him on that just because I thought he was acting so authority and then I'm putting all my dogs on it yeah but it's only been like two weeks and I feel like it's good I mean there that's a lot less volume yeah so they're hungry right\n... well no postage and I mean you've got my number so you know I'd love to hear about it but I Would recommend that you just go slowly because we don't know who's got a ... easy going pancreas and who doesn't and rise that pancreas gets irritated it's really hard to pull it off\nAnd thanks for

S. H. I'm not sure what that means mystic short haired cats you should go to much like clockwork one hour after eating in the morning a feeder a major brand wet canned food one sixth of a cat about what else what should I Do that's from Joe in college the ... one hour like clockwork\nYeah one hour yeah well I Would definitely say that's not normal and I think that's worth and a work out that there hasn't been one to okay yeah like literally off the allergies it absolutely can be a food allergy and but I I hate to have it\n[noise] I hate to be so flippant about it and to keep switching the food around if there's something really going on but you could try that first of all you could as long as there's been an exam and a vet had gone and not really sure that your help hated for an abdominal math or something you are now\nThis one's from Alison in Washington, Massachusetts we have two cats better about four years old one is female the other male\nWe adopted them at the same time in the last year or so the male cat\nHas started going to the bathroom outside the litter box and not all the time but at least once a day we keep the litter box clean we are not sure why any suggestions from Alison in Washington mess Mm and without urinating or ... they had just says going through the ... review from miserable for what would you have your doctor I Do too\nWell and here's the and the reason why I ask is is there those are two completely different problems right if the cat is urinating outside the box um you want to look at the urine right see what's going on and if they're dedicating outside the box it means at some point typically they have had at least one episode of painful\nPainful to being a ha so uh and that means we could have a constitution problem or a food issue or whatever so those are just not an issue where there's one boxer too can I add that could be it too although I Would expect the cat to do it more often when all the time but um yeah maybe add to more litter boxes because usually the rule of thumb is\nOne box per cat plus one oh okay so you have\nTo go to ... throughout that yes exactly [laughter] well it is the quality of life I lead from Tom who says folks that you and me ... topical please\nI personally like the rest of color if I'm allowed to say that on line but around it okay great um I like the rest of the color for dogs especially because they\nPersonally like the rest of the color if I'm allowed to say that on line but rounded okay great um I like the rest of the color for dogs especially because they had cats they go outside they pick up takes they bring them inside so I think of them that color as protecting not only the animal but the people as well because it does have a repellent effect\nOr back to our phone lines and Xena in Pittsfield you run\nHigh I have a three and a half year old male dog he's a film it for the doctrine and Everytime you drink water he ends up like it sounds like he's choking and I tried to like making it warmer and freezing up the bulls not bending over like every time you drink it\nSure it's not you [laughter] I don't share it [laughter] 'cause I Can't come up with something um\nThat's a real it does he does he do this with food or just water\nJugs water he eat food fine each treats by everything but when he drinks I don't know if you're drinking like he's got two different water bowl you always got water so it's not like he's like so Thursday that I'm just getting the water like Google\nAnd when he when he took to the coffee or what is\nHe just said is it like one gag or is it\nOh no it's like a bunch he'll do it for like a good thirty seconds after he\nDrank a boy\nYou stumped the ... yeah well I don't I feel\nLike I should have an answer for you um or at least the suggestion but I I Do not I'm not sure what to say about that I mean I Would expect I you know I wouldn't mind if you were to get a chest X rayed it to make sure his esophagus looks okay\nHe's now clearly um the breed that we would expect to see like a mega ...
