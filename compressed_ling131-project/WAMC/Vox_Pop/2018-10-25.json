it fees and that grass is dead it's not coming back\nYou have to read it which you could do now where you could do in the spring and or if you treat it with one of these new window physically in his grass as I said no it's been around for years there's some grasses that are resistant to the church going\nAnd they don't eat it so you'd want to get something that has insect resistant grass it but either now or in the spring\nUh-huh and their product names for that kind of a glass said he's\nUsually a ... right I think it's typically rescue 'em but radio you'll get a mix it will have some of it

just literally plant those sim you're going to use 'em or somewhere else in the spring so you just want to kind of hold them through the winter so the easiest way to do that leave him in the containers big holes just as deep as a top of the container and a plan on pot and all I Would leave 'em up maybe an inch or so it's just that you can get a hold of the container for\nThe summer that going to be able to plant them that's the problem you can't have them in no and they were\nOkay so then you've got to you've got to mulch them in um they can't come into your home they they won't they won't make it through the winter actually they need to go to sleep and stay sleeping they need to be outdoors um so you do need to get most up to the top of those containers otherwise the winter winds will end up probably\nI Would I Would be inclined not to lay them down and most of the whole thing because you know I Would read a wire but for an animal to get in either of us ... yeah yeah\nSo so you know in the um in our our business we might have some plants left over at the end of the year and a though we have some um different storage mechanisms just pushing all those parts together we have five or six or ten boss making a little box\nIf you have a a house or a garage that has the north side has no sun whatsoever you could make that little grouping on that side that believe it or not that the the most protected side for the winter and then when it gets cold\nThanksgiving or thereabouts as um everyone's been saying just push some ... around the pots and then you should be pretty well see that\nYou could also bring them into an owner heated structure her garage or a bar and I've done that many times and and just get them out of the wind and the weather and that'll be enough so that might be sending on\nWhat plans it is and how bad the winner gets right um and everything around those roots though are going to help it just a lot easier yeah what about watering even water and then now and be done with it yeah there we go to if there was a when you're really dry out you know I don't imagine you and and I would say neither one of your own wedding them\n\n\n\nWhat
