I'm not as familiar with this but this sounds like there might be an issue with somebody paying their mortgage or making payments on the on the reverse mortgage\nI've actually researched into this and what happens is on when the value was established\nFor the reverse mortgage say they value the house at a hundred thousand and it's been five years and now they've already been able to cash out that hundred thousand and they're continuing to cash out on it where they stopped cashing out on it now the has technically its upside down\nThat so they owe more on the house and the house has actually valued and they may not be able to pay that back this is why I had had taken it over\nSo you need to figure out who who to call you need to speak to hide in to see what red tape you have to get through to get to the right people and whatever the difference as you might be able to buy out the house for whatever owed\nUs off with aps a lawyer would be the best option at this point\nProbably yes yes I mean you could try calling an eight hundred number see how far you get with them it really depends on how deep into the paperwork and into Hyde it's it's already been in and what needs to happen next\nThe great thank you very much good luck factor oh that sounds good using it is\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks

Lewis of Alexander Monticello here to answer your real estate questions we go to sue north ...\nHi I'm I was calling about my house I had planned on putting it on the market um this fall but there was more work than I anticipated so it's not quite ready yet\nAnd it's probably going to be in a two hundred thousand range I'm just wondering um you know what you say as as a local market and maybe the spring\nUm is there any advantage to try to rush through and and get this on the market say within the next month or wait till the spring\nWe've talked about this the seasonal ah aspect to this whole thing and I think there are differing opinions who wants to go first\nAll right let me go first so yes there is obviously that's being marketed when everybody gets their homes and the market\nOn the lake the big thing that I discuss with my sellers and my clients that may want away is when we enter the market we have a lot more competition so we are no longer leading the market we may be following the market and doing what everybody else is doing\nA if you could I Would probably way to the holidays on just because it does slow down and if you need some time you know choose that time to get everything done\nJanuary February the winter market not a lot of ... out there you are the seller can lead the market and price it maybe a little bit higher\nBecause there isn't going to be a lot of um you know it's a virus looking and you might be able to get a little bit more for your home at that point so don't went to market scare you I think it's a great time to get the house and the markets that it's a new year people are excited\nHopefully the interest rates don't go up anymore and you should be and I go to\nThe showers you concur yeah I mean I so I I think uh a couple of things to watch um interest rates are rising a little bit ah and if interest rates continue to rise that could that could eat into the buyers purchasing power\nUm so I pay attention to interest rates the other thing is two years ago in December we had a really busy December that was right after the presidential election um for some reason there was a lot of pent up demand I think we're buyers were holding back and interestingly enough between\nYou know like November seventh and January first it got really really busy um so I don't know with all the attention on this election if there will be a similar burst of buyer demand\nOn but one tip I could give you is right now when when you get the sunny day maybe tomorrow it looks like it's going to be a sunny day I Would take some outdoor photos of the yard front of the house to the back of the house so if you do decide to list alternately in January at least you have some photos where the grass hiring\nSo you don't really thank you so you don't really want to take pictures with the smell piled up to the window\nYou can't if you have to but it's always nice to show the green grass right\nVery interesting so that's a psychological ... you've proven that this this psychology works over an hour we\nWill certainly pictures matter in terms of selling the house yeah I think\nIt works in reverse as well as you know you see all this thing in the summertime that has now I'm at a no good [laughter]\nAnd it gets even worse if you have a pool right if you're trying to sell a house with a pool um it's a deal to sell it when it's Ninety degrees in\nJuly when you're like oh and I'm trying to show how old the covers very Troy says no I'm not not not as he learned fair enough or let's go to Robert in Greenfield Robert ...\nAh yes I was just wondering um\nNo I'm not not not as eating right fair enough uh let's go to Robert and Greenfield Robert Iran\nUh yes I was just wondering um my partner and I we decided he'd like his ashes spread around property but recently decided that perhaps\nYou should just be buried on the property or without you know and how to wondering how that might affect the value of the property five acre lot you know and there's no restrictions in the local governments\nWho that's I've never told jumping I Would never ever have any there you know I I\nI think there's two things to consider here the value of the property in the wishes of your partner and what's more important um ... maybe that's that's the way to look\nAt it I don't think that would be anything that needs to be that's close to you\nWhat was the only ones who are now yes yes but the ashes\nAre no go ahead we originally wanted ashes but then I'm asked to cremation has a huge a carbon footprint so we thought perhaps just bearing um body on the property in a in a green way\nYeah that that that may be a full disclosure something that you may have to disclose when you sell the property and it clearly you know potentially I'm a little bit of a concern on the buyer and that's a new one but it is it really is a new and I I mean I've had pets buried in the backyard that a little\nBit overwhelming I found a um\nI guess it would depend on that city town and county rules in rags on maybe check into that first talked to some local realtor to see what they say and again I I Do agree with Alex Gino respect your partner's wishes and you know ... on on the value and so I\nThink I couldn't be more helpful thanks a lot you know a good guess in the old days was fairly common can be normal to him to do to\nThat we had to pay a lot of money that was found on the inspection of house certainly not that that were open it's actually and I didn't know there was any course of course actually take take Libya that\nWell I mean a couple of thoughts in just reiterating with what I said to the other caller New York is a buyer beware stage so um you know if the sellers provided a property condition disclosure statement\nI don't think they did\nOkay um so you know I'm not a you know if if they didn't provide a property condition disclosure statement I'm I'm not sure there is any recourse I'm\nA you know the other the other complication you're going to have is one proving that the defect existed\nAt the time you purchase dead and then even if you did that um if the person is has a short sale or it sounds like they weren't able to to make their mortgage payments had to get out of their house you know how to how even if you had a viable legal Kate how would you actually get money from the seller uh sounds like they may not be financially capable 'em\nLoose in the short sales in the house is not being told by the bank but still by the owner\n... the owner is selling the property but he he or she is doing it with the cooperation of the bank because the bank is going to take a haircut on their mortgage um but what I Would say is just maybe checking with your attorney and see if they have any uh potential ideas but it sounds like this one might be really difficult\nOr Lisa thank you for the call and sorry we don't have better news for you have to take a quick break eight hundred three for eight to five

fear the number's eight hundred three for eight to five five one real estate on the program today and Alexander Monticello and run NATO Louis are with us this\nGerman via email and then back to the phones for the final moments on the program several moments ago if you want to call by the way are you going for three or four to five by one number this were given from mark\nA when buying a car even a person with bad credit or no credit confined several winters were willing to work with them why does this happened in the housing market especially with supplied being what it is where can a person with bad credit or no credit find a good lender by the way are you know if you're buying a two hundred thousand dollar Mazda rotter you'd maybe don't want to get that\nRight correct I think it really depends on why that credit is not good I'm with the bankruptcy with their unpaid ... is there too much debt to income\nUm there are some lenders that will work with you with a lower credit score however feel under five hundred it's it's going to be pretty much impossible to get into a home and the reason they do that it's because\nWhen you die and your credit to debt ratio is that low you probably cannot afford a mortgage payment\nThey don't want to put you on a home where you're going to default on a mortgage and not and be house apart and put you in that position so much much stricter in the housing market going back ten years ago at the subprime with a big indication of what happens\nI'll just add that if you're looking to repair your credit I think the Affordable housing partnership which is a non for profit offers those services or they might even be free so that might be something you want to look into\nAll right Michael thank you for that email is go back to the phones of eight hundred three or four eight to five five one I'm Teresa Teresa in Albany is uh [noise]\nI [noise] All right\nWe had um purchased a house in April and we did have a property disclosure and sellers disclosed that they had had a bad back on septic tank that had been repaired\nAnd ... that the ... that changed them onto your prior to ask perched in the house and the day we moved into septic system backed up in the basement\nAnd we've been battling with septic system problems since that we had to replace the pipe that went from house to the bank um it was crushed we've had to replace the type that ... that was crushed and broken in several places um what kind of records do we have ... or\nSo again the standard is you have to be able to prove that the seller had actual knowledge of the effect\nI'm so and so it it you know one scenario is right they they were aware that there was a baffle 'cause that's what they saw and that's what they're stopped the company told them but they were on aware of the other issues um and that would probably be their defense but ... you would in order to to have a claim against them you'd have to prove that they had actual knowledge of those other issues\nUm you know maybe talking to their their septic company who services septic tank and ask them where they ever called to do any other repairs or did they ever get any estimate to do any of that work and decide not to pursue it\nUm you know but it's again it's a very steep hill to climb 'cause you have to prove that the seller had actual knowledge um and so I'll just also say that you probably would want to check in with your attorney is well does that answer\nStreaming support for WAMC come from birch are Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life

is that there are certain counties have small claims courts and those standards are a little looser um\nYou know and so you you could try to to make a small claims you know the thing is though I\nAnd I I don't know this for sure but it seems to me that if you were to take this to be logical and which would be in a courtroom the expense would be more than fixing the search them well\nThis small
