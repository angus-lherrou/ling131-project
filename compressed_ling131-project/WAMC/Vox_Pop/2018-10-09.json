technologies are developed to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere\nThe un Intergovernmental Panel on climate change says pledges from the world's governments to reduce greenhouse gases made in Paris in two thousand Fifteen are not enough to keep global warming from rising more than two point seven degrees Fahrenheit above pre industrial temperatures\nSo most most of the extra energy that our planet receives from global warming actually is stored in the ocean most of it is not even used to warm up our planet directly it gets stored in the ocean and then over time it's it's get released\nAnd that happens every few years but what triggered the event\nThat I mean you're then you're okay now it gets a little more complex\nAll right well we'll take a break here in a moment for you have twenty seconds and then I think we wanted to follow up\nOkay so El Nino events basically what they are at the ocean and the atmosphere they talk to each other they interact with one another and they do this on different time scales and that leads to the ocean basically being quiet for a while taking up all the energy and then at some point the ocean is it's enough I got to release all is

do you agree if so what is the best way to create carbon tax legislation\nOkay the last parts hard because um it it's a complicated subject I first of all I definitely agree that putting some kind of a cost on carbon\nIs needed to help us move more quickly you know if if your if your goal is to move quickly you've got to put a price on the things that you want to discourage so um how do you do it\nAre the best way that I have heard her I've looked at a lot of different systems is one put out by a citizens climate lobby and uh also of a few other groups where you would put a fee on the carbon content of fuels\nAnd refund that the somehow to all households throughout the country so that people would see the ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery

toward a more fishing cart toward changing their heating system towards uh putting some solar panels on roofs things like that okay\nOr this one is from Philomena and posting kill would you please address how climate changes impacting on threatening agriculture\n\nIs a good question it depends a little bit to where you are and what part of the world the biggest threat for agriculture is not here in the north east um the largest changes are the biggest threats they expect to see in tropical of agents that are already very hot today\nA that's a number of um crops that have upper limits on that hates tolerance that will not produce so not grow when it gets too hot read this one such example\nSo they think the biggest problem for food production a global scale will be in and tropical countries but there's certainly a suspect in the U.S we see this today already a during periods of extreme drought for example\nSo increase drought an increased he puts a lot of stress on many crops including soybeans and corn et cetera\nAll right this one is from David and a few rights given the deadline of approximately twelve years originally announced where humans to change their behaviors\nThat adversely affect the climate of planet earth what are the most practical things than average citizen should do in light of this warning and should not voting for political leaders who will take appropriate measures be at the top of the list and that drum David\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think are looking at a political leaders and getting them to put climate change and actions uh uh to to address it on the top of their list is very important and voting is the way to get their attention\nAll right this one is the last female will do and then we'll get back to the phones a lot of people are waiting a long time this one's from Samuel in Cooperstown could what seems to be an increase in massive earthquakes off and on the ocean floor with resulting sue nominees be caused by the worldwide increase of feet on the surface of the earth\nThe question is a resounding no we actually know whether this extra heat comes from we can measure the extra energy at the top of our atmosphere sites coming from\nUm above sort of the greenhouse gases we ... we can measure the energy that goes into the planet system and we can measure the energy that's going out and it's an imbalance and it's caused by greenhouse gases\nNo I think Samuels question was could be earthquakes because ... the increase of feet on the surface of the earth\nNo earthquakes are costs by plate tectonics place that um are abducted and below on another place that are I'm rubbing against one another it has nothing to do with the increase in greenhouse gas\nAll right let's go back to the phones eight hundred three two

and hitting Sheila um but you're saying that the money does flow back to the household say you have income constrain senior it's for home the kid in class or a big issue and you have a lower income families and\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNegative how are you going to how do you how do you persuade them that actually they were they come out ahead of the game paying higher prices how how does that work economically\nOkay um that's a good question and and it's one that has to be taken very seriously as you design a system\nFirst of all ah I've seen a number of studies that indicate that lower income people actually come out ahead\nThe greatest energy use as a by the higher income uh segments of the of the population not the lower income segments I'm the U.S treasury a Internal Revenue service tax or analysis unit put out a very nice paper\nIn January of ... of twenty Seventeen it's working paper one one five\nAnd it has a ... a ... analyzed what happens to a different groups in the population if you refund or what you collect\nAnd the bottom or Seventy sixty to Seventy percent of income earners do better\nNet net on their uh after tax income with with that kind of a system now implementing it may you still have to have some special safeguards for a at risk parts portions of the population or so but\nThe basic idea of getting it on the back to everybody so that they can decide what's best for them or seems to work thank you\nThanks and we appreciate the call our number is eight hundred three for eight to five five one Lou al ... and with the U.S we are here to answer your questions and let's now go to Steven in Berlin Steven\nUm another up soon is that you sequester carbon for example like ... which is another of each company where they take the carbon right at that a site\nWhere um they extract oils from the north to see the reason they're doing that is because nobody has a carbon tax and it's actually cheaper for them to sequester the carbon injected underground again so there's an incentive there\nAnother way but that's really something that we have not developed to a point where it could be deployed is to try to actually um sequester carbon right out of the air so basically install big shelters where you feel to the air\nAnd um you at ... the carbon with some rescued you and you again come precedent injected on the ground the problem right now is that for all of these um programs and it's very very expensive for not at the point where we can really use that to college in a large scale\nYou may recall that for Twenty years ago ten Fifteen Years ago uh the coal industry was talking about clean coal mhm this is what they were talking about it never happened it's too expensive\nOr that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be a doing research on trying to a sequester carbon or possibly a trap carbon dioxide that's already in the atmosphere but it's expensive and it's going to take a massive\nEffort to based on just what I Know of as un report anything we do is going to be expensive yes but some much more than others we have to take a quick break here we are joined today by materials we flew all that and we talk climate change eight hundred three for eight to five
