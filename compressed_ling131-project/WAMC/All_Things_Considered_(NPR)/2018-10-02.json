is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual
