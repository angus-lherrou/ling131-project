year to over nine hundred and twenty Fifteen before collapsing oil prices reduce the use of the technique increased earthquakes in Alberta, Canada were triggered by fracking in that area\nA recent study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz analyzed data from around the world on earthquakes clearly associated with injection wells\nThe unexpected result is that a single injection well can cause earthquakes a distance is more than six miles from the well in addition the study found that injecting fluids into sedimentary rock can cause larger more distant earthquakes than injecting into the underlying basement rock\nThe letter result is a real problem because the prevailing wisdom is that injection should target sedimentary rock because it should be safer than injecting into the basement rock\nThe mechanism for the quakes appears to be that when water is injected into the ground the push is on the surrounding rock and creates elastic stress which could put pressure on false from a distance without even putting water into those faults\nThe findings of the study help explain the extent of and decides Mississippi and places like Oklahoma where there are many injection sites in oil and gas fields Oklahoma now has more earthquakes each year than California\nThe study did not even include sites in Oklahoma\nBecause there are so many injection wells that it is not possible to

will be on the bench tomorrow when the Supreme Court hold oral arguments he was confirmed over the weekend on a narrow party line vote and today the president told a group of law enforcement officers

how the political battle over canonize affecting the mid term elections in a bad but first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley have got I also have a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the court will will shifted to the will see over the next few decades potentially\nHe will certainly shift the court to the right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federalist society and the Heritage Foundation a list of reliable conservatives and that's something you couldn't always say about the justice she'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy\nKennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court most famously on a string of gay rights cases but also for example in reaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to that's right [laughter] it'll be up to robbers to decide how much judicial restraint to exercise and then that will determine whether this\nShift is a gradual series of rightward steps or one big leap\nDo you think the very bitter confirmation fight we saw over the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation as a political body\nIt it certainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats and\nTo the extent their decisions divvy up along those partisan lines the court runs the risk of being seen as just another political branch of government staff by partisans in robes rather than an impartial body that somehow above politics\nAnd it certainly doesn't help the Kavanaugh is confirmed by that extremely narrow vote with just one Republican one Democrat breaking ranks and the Senate\nAlso listen to how President Trump described the campaign against Kavanaugh today\nWas a disgraceful

midterm but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly in an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of been\nSteady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift that sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that that really lengthy almost like scorched earth of posts about how she really feels about the upcoming mid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people that would really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she would secretly a conservative just because she never said anything though [laughter]\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe had to have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit and the way that\nBecause you still have the country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nThis is what I've been trained as the mystery of the day and I always had denied her mind from Italy exactly Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nLooked at her method after this she kind of a looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out and well she didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her\nSexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he

bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images the when the elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that Mitt's identifies people of color much more frequently than at MIT's identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as ...\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question\nSo easily win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAnd someone who really understands where that science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility is something that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot

other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you were testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers\nWas that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nTo no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working

which they did they were a front page news\nThere were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and so there's this in media pushback\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes\nThey create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that
