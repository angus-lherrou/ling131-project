maybe reminiscent of a Rembrandt but it's actually the work of artificial intelligence it's called the portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars\nComputer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this in welcome thank you a pleasure to be here outside\nHow controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine and hang it on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is\nFor the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand that things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price an art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well\nThey still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that work at St ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo the artist in this case is it the code words he wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artists have to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective and maybe even a little bit of a ... for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by
