talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that you had had\nFirst hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognized how did you navigate that so as we were\nGoing my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse we were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is\nOur main objective was to make sure that he had the fool immunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely us other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nYou can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the people ... who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband\nBecause he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president in the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to the social aspects as well as legal aspects of\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place in two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for it to ... these are not the Trump Administration said as as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that compares to different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August filled\nThat what's essential that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U. S. throughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage\nBut you're you're not allowing that person who was a great representative for the United nations or another international organization\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of the families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because we're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship in so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get a visa the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow and figure out how to get married and I know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat James Wiley Bruce ... he was in ... to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Seventeen he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global ambassador thank you so much for talking to us\nWell it's such a pleasure to speak with you and I wish you to have the best days\nNow to our series on China's growing influence in the world\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu estimates are growing\nRapidly it's often said that Brazil provides the food on China's dinner table from soybeans to beef and chicken those expert helped make China Brazil biggest trading partner as NPR's Philip Reeves reports Brazil also had something else the Chinese want\nYou see the ads every way [noise]\nMan uh playing soccer under ... afternoon sun looking and you'll notice that something different about this ... we're in Brazil yet over players Chinese teenagers who've come here eleven thousand miles from home to pursue a dream\nMade you mean if if you go I Want to go to my country to him in China\nThey work up to my big ...\nPi I'm In Korea by anti is Seventeen he's here to learn how to make it to the top in professional soccer or football as everyone here calls and he's glad he came\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nSurveying essay a license to drone mapping and drone inspection services to public and private clients throughout New York and Connecticut T.

officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of the teenager outlook on McDonald's\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died\nWeek earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nThe violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers get up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of the country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about that so we've contacted Maria have felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the number is I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nI from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at is not so much the number switch statistically you know yes when when you say\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nGo novice we talking about for the something off he says votes said this something offices so from my perspective it's really what drives they'll send the winds of police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what that I often there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know whether it's some trends that\nWe are seeing that these dangerous and disturbing I Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina kid is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so it's kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent yes we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity or whether they're handling you know persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations ... and ... no longer be\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it if it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general the climate on in the last few years is that on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity to us violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus it triggering event then you have the the cut us off it got to come\nSo if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court you think police offsets pushing that demonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them is part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police are so because you cannot take your and get out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative of the government was a police officer\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we're looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are at ... ... ... active it is definitely a training issue office so frequently\nA sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given that particular environment and given that said and political development that might be putting their lives in danger so\nTechnical issues how you approach and the ... and how we approach the house or well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous the problem is that we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have eight in South ... police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThen that gets in and of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine office says the new one yeah I I killed in that line of duty an outcome move to
