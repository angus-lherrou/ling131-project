for a couple of years we've ran out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there was so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that

mean I Can't imagine the psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind

basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated on a ship\nThat after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so

imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials say it did\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference that almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international

just got this crazy idea of could we use these human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things sell in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision and fly or even a mouse\nMice don't fence read they don't have these red detecting cells and so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in the human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first and comes to respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fly right hormone was involved in the development of these ... so called cone so you had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added fire right harm onto the dash during their development and we got more red green con developing I'm In Oregon and and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to couldn't from that side right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the team still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that is the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition it's been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular so Johnston hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular organized\nSteven backer of the national eye Institute says that he was like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in
