thousand dollars a year to find out what happened on the other side of Dumont avenue people told me to go to church\n\nReverend David Cay Brawley is one of the leaders of east Brooklyn congregations in his office he tells me that in the early Nineteen eighties Brownsville New York was often referred to as\nThe beginning and the civilization burned out homes empty lot people were leaving the city and grow\nIn the eighties New York city had been hard hit by a recession then the crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of Dumont\n[noise] the New York city governments sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the men in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem\nThe family was going and we needed something that was much better for the children\nWas philosophy is Audra mom she and her husband came to New York from Honduras and beliefs fleeing poverty they identify as both black and Hispanic they say they're grateful that public housing was available when they needed it but jumped on the chance to move on when the children were born\nI didn't like elevators up on them elevated for my children because it was a lot of people living in the housing projects\nFor a lot of people in Brownsville and surrounding areas coming up with thirty thousand dollars for a house was impossible for the Blasio family it took generations worth of savings\nMy mother her first total bimbo then eventually it was hard working she used the

house is in Brooklyn gave children space to do homework a good night's sleep\nWhen people have ownership of their properties ownership of the community you have a better chance of addressing our core issues such as education and quality of life\nAnd neighborhood that can focus on more than just surviving the day to day probably points out that those quaint thirty thousand dollars in my house is built on land once sold for a buck or now valued at as much as half a million\nWhat has happened is is that families now have wealth that they can pass down generationally\nAnd that's just what the ... dead they passed in the in my home on to one of their daughters\nAfter I leave the family I Walk just a few blocks to Dumont avenue according to the atlas it's the dividing line on the map it looks jarring but in person it's completely an spectacular people bustle on their way to work cars zoomed by just another New York city street\nTo ask questions specifically of each of them and I think in the case of judge Kavanaugh he literally responded to more questions in writing than any other Supreme Court justice\nAlthough a lot of new information has of course come to light some some some of his written responses came and let me let me let me ask you this basic question\nHow is it not in everyone's interest especially judge Kavanaugh's if he wants to clear his name for the FBI to given to be given that space and time to run all credible current allegations to the ground\nBasically the agreement was that we would take a week and that during that time the FBI had full availability to do what ever they felt needed to be done\nAnd that was being made at the request of a group of senators who still wanted more information\nMost of the individuals who did not a plan to vote are the ones that are saying the lay it again look let's be honest this is a political maneuver on their on their part [noise]\nHit by a look the story behind this as as the Senate it's supposed to be advise and consent and then this particular case they're strong feeling up here the Republicans are the Democrats Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy mission from day one\nYou're renting pilot ... and then they put out just on that and the moments we have left because they've been ... absolutely they agreed that says about politics that says Republicans trying to get your guy confirmed before the midterm election\nOh I think there's a lot of truth to that we've said number one we would do it in a normal ordered a we were up to I Believe in Ninety One days now right and the average about sixty were about three weeks past the normal for the last five United States Supreme Court justice\nRounds thanks so much you bet Mike Rounds of South Dakota and we'll

edu\nGather that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath chat letting and joins me now Hi there how are you man I I'm All right thank you I your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released your statement this past\nSunday I've just summarized it they're so let me straight to what you did with this information you ended your statement saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you\nDid you uh yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows cited not I was never called back I waited by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email but nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or kids proof allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the so usually a committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes there is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of where the phrase is black and you know I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the black man phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one oh\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered to this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to a what I Know about like maybe three maybe four to eighty five at your college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\nThat's chat chat letting ...

healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work or in looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have\nBut it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it and is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive\nBecause if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nAs part of course the coast of our economic podcast the indicator from Planet Money they fought pleasure Ari

say\nYou said the affair was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI is that they are when they're told that they allowed to be very thorough following leaves wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw it today in the narrow scope that they've given that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of getting a Gallup allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them well\nI mean that's part of it and and what we do know about um situations like this where someone is a victim of sexual assault that they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it is absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford\nDidn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that how traumatized she wasn't it wasn't really until years later a

back here in the studio now with detail to carry I'm Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being\nCharged unwind now its timing yeah the defendant or sat in current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt papers say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's this is very current yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all of\nThese seven Russian officers are in Russia or are there is no us extradition treaty in place so\nWho why bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled the European countries where there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen the D. O. j.'s that its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government impose sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched the cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes were of eating drug\nTest embarrassed by that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and\nAgainst the truth itself\nNow Mary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tell the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the Netherlands announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence\nOr coordinated very much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife find networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year ... ... exactly I\nMean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which begs the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again and one unusual things stood out this

earth's moon formed after large collusion knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat is rock vapor and and what does that have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on a heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that kids the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are
