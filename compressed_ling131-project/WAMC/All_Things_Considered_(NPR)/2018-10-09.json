right here on earth in fact it is there like literally start that is what astrophysicist Adam Frank says and I'm going to let him explain\nDirt and by dirt I mean soil is always around to remind us that the world is one giant interconnected Claude of a wonder\nSee if you can just open your science eyes when you look at a handful of soil suddenly you're going to see not just dirt but a seamless and essential network binding together matter energy and life\nWhat do I mean well like a cake batter soils are a mix of ingredients they're made of crushed up rocks sticky clays and a whole lot of organic stuff decaying leaves bacteria worm poop all mixed together\nLet's start with the organic stuff pick up a handful of dirt from a field or a forest floor and you'll be holding more microbes in your hand then there are stars and the galaxy\nBut those billions of microbes don't just live in the soil they make the soil alive if you could zoom in on your hand full of dirt you'd see it was built from countless tiny clumps of rock and play\nAnd like a box full of different sizes balls there are a lot of gaps in pathways between those clumps that's where the microbes live and they use those gaps to full advantage turning the soil into both a hyper complicated network of subway tunnels and the churning chemical reactor\nIf this chemistry party in a sponge architecture that makes soil the foundation for all the rest of life around you\nSee those busy microbes metabolizing along in the tunnels are what led soil filter rainwater keeping it clean for us to drink\nAnd the elements in the rocks and clay that helped the microbes move nutrients round to underground roots living acorns turned into giant oaks and wheat seeds turn into the bread for lunch\nIt's not the microbes alone at work these miracles and it's not the minerals enclaves by themselves that let acorns become oaks soils are a dynamic pulsing tightly woven fabric with Adams constantly being shuffled from non living forms over to the living and back to the non living again\nThrough soils we can see how our bodies and our lives are also a tightly woven tapestry of living and non living world it's not just us over here in the world over there each of us as part of the cosmic fabric of matter energy and change who strands can never be separated\nEach of us is an ongoing expression of this earth we were born to

pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell first of all you have to let them know that number one their vote counts um you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about a more than just the sport that basically\nWe all athletes that you were talking to\nYou know what it was oh after we okay I'm a I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform and in the right word\nBut more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of the time the state and local

to go about it I think all of the work that they're doing is important work that we're going to the coalition is important um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want to have you on a ... the people's hearts change towards the issues that a lot of we try to not what's really going\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany
