the theorized point in time when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum was reached after which there'd be a terminal decline there was often presented as a looming catastrophe for civilization well people kept finding new sources of oil and new ways to extract it in that peak never got much closer\nInstead with the ongoing transition to renewable energy and the focus on reducing emissions what is looming if peak fossil fuel demand according to a new study by nonprofit think tank carbon tracker fossil fuel demand could speak as soon as twenty twenty three\nDemand for coal oil and gas is stalling as the costs of clean energy and battery storage continue to fall\nAnd us governments shift away from fossil fuels in pursuit of their pledges under the Paris climate agreement overall there's predicted to be a one to one and a half percent annual growth rate in global energy demand but at the same time the global deployment of wind and solar power is expected to increase by Fifteen to twenty percent each year\nWith these trends fossil fuel demand will peak at some point over the next ... years most likely in twenty twenty three\nThe fossil fuel industry has less pessimistic from their perspective projections believing they realize that it is not a matter of if but only when the transition will occur that is true that some industries in applications are likely to be dependent on fossil fuels for much longer periods of time\nBut the overall trend is clear is something that is making fossil fuel investors\nVery uneasy [noise] for more information on this topic and other

the first time he has talked about caravans uh he talked about a different caravan back in April\nA this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news ah and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nWith one of the ... and there are those are the caravan didn't just

S. is counted on the houses out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to reimpose sanctions on Iran aimed at removing Iranian oil and gas exports from the market\nAnderson says that move could now becoming at an awkward moment November\nFool foods when sanctions on Iran or increased again and the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market about the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... fate something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves [noise]\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those right around the world David Cay wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome\nThank you it's good to be her walk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate ... disappearance on perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before we've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the consulate they should get access to whatever\nTurkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it\nPretty quickly I think and we are talking a team of what size roughly theoretically theoretically maximum five people [noise]\nI'm curious about some of the practicality of how this would work 'cause she'll she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago which at the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the police as you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation it's\nI mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access\nTo the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the church to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen\nAnd then what happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they could ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think\nIs a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not a not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around that the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by\nA number of states those included states like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid Cay he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expression thanks very much thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News\n\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what do they say they say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was on the river almost zero

love thousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit of the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now that\nSounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is what I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House it's something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of or soda I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug do see on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach do the for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor has done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic\nIt Republicans want to appeal hardy why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric\nAnd there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo

little library and the first place\nWell Todd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick rocks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he writes about projects especially those that had to do with youth or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now are too much of the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up and sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them in prison in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda\nA hospital in Ireland near schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries

using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nAs I said okay I'm up for what we want to vote for [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front what this tells them because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then
