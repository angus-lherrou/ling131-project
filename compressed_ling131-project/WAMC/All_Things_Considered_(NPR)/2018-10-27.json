{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "But treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof of who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina\nThe federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just briefly as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there uh there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiments\nA and the alleged shooter in this case was of course alive in custody so possibly uh looking to question him\nThat if NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to thank you\nOnce again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd that in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race and pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful event we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility\nThey told us they hope for more unity\nAnd then the message that might have special residents in Gettysburg the site of an epic civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three wonder if this country's bloody is one more than fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there have been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach bringing people of different political views together\nIt's called politics fact and civility Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy my also a Democrat joined a group through her friendship with Tom sent and Republican Chad collie it's also a member and he told me why he got involved\nTwenty sixteen in previous years before that was very politically involved I was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally\nDuring the twenty sixth in campaign or saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways and uh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success would weave district to me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nLike this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who've been calling for something like this language on cases in Ohio or I Know maybe Joe Biden you could you know the same argument on average I'm Tom Ridge venue former governor of Pennsylvania from ... security\nBut you it sounds like that with something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car and came up with a structure for that ... what about you is this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now no like really\nI um I have always done a pretty staunch Democrat\nI that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive I never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved I think that realizing\nThat that there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find is has just been a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish\nI was hoping that we could come to understand each other more\nAnd I I'm very convinced as doors who just said that there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue voter\nBut I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the story of the blind man and the the elephant\nWhich um I don't know if you're familiar with the looked up ... book expert political judgment\nIn which he actually test the theory that the more you investigate various points of view\nThe more likely you are to be correct in predicting what will happen in the future for example\nSo Darcy not that you were saying I don't want to talk to those people many ... but um [laughter] what you're doing is I'm hungry for this experience it's others were what made
