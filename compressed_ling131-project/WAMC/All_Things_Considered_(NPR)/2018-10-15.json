our region and\nWe had four hundred opportunities and we needed forty thousand dollars now\nIf we make it so we've already made a a a chunk of almost a quarter of that we've already made okay so uh we need to get to a very specific number which is seven hundred and twenty eight thousand dollars and and that would mean that we will have made a fifty thousand dollars in our time together forty

two three WAMC wanted people to think lots of business to do\nLots of money to make\nIt ends on you that's right now we have a full two hours to do this and and we're going to take every second of it and uh and we need you and we're going to need every second because we have a lot of work to do now\nOr what I wanted what I just want to re set the table here unless you know what we're talking on the table for foreign because we're feeding a family of four [noise]\nWhat we're doing tonight is uh\nFor a hundred dollar pledge to WAMC for a hundred dollar pledge that triggers that money that a hundred dollars comes to WAMC but that triggers both to see more Fox foundation and MVP healthcare to\nCome together and provide the resources to the food pantry is with the capital district to feed a family of four for three months think of that a family of four services for a family of four for three months\nAt a food pantry in their region\nSo that means that we had at the beginning of this for a hundred opportunities to help\nFour hundred families and we want to make sure that we get every dollar we can get so that every family that we can help has been helped in other words we want all the money\nBecause we want to make sure that the four hundred and families are helped\nOne eight hundred three two three nine to six two so there's a bunch of different ways of thinking about this one of the ways to think about it is that we're asking you to give us\nA hundred dollars so that you can help a family of four that's on the on the simplest of of levels\nBut also that you show love\nAnd compassion and empathy and concern for people in our region our neighbors our friends\nPeople who we go to the store with people who are children go to school with people who we meet in the public library people that we made in the grocery store people that we see\nThat are opposite us reading crappy magazines and the doctor's office\nAre the people that we're talking about I spoke to some about this earlier if I defy you to go to your local food pantry that is in your region where you live and not know someone [noise]\nIt's heartbreaking it's concerning but we can't turn our backs on

happening in our current political state is returning our backs on things were turning our back on the climate we're turning our back on the economy we're turning our back\nOn women's rights and on gay rights were turning our back on our judiciary or turning our back on so many of our freedom but if we have the opportunity not to turn our back on a family of four that we know then we're doing something that is concrete we're helping this radio station\nBut we're also helping and showing empathy and compassion in love and care\nFor other people we will be okay no matter what happens if we are kind and generous and lovely to people who are around us\nIf we tribal lives and we say screw you and\nYou don't believe what I Believe or you don't make what I make then we're on a very dangerous what we are on a very dangerous world but it it's going to take us it's going to take our group it's going to take a group of us together a community of people which\nIs what WAMC is\nTo come together and to say I am going to help someone that I don't know or maybe I Do and I'm going to help feed that family of four for three months I mentioned the\nTwo hundred thousand votes\nOr however many people are listening\nFilling the capital more [noise]\nAll empowered to do something amazing just maybe just this morning but isn't that enough to know that your\nDonation to a radio station is is helping feed a family of four for three months it's it's it's it's kind of a remarkable thing that you could do without leaving your couch\nIt is we're making it as easy as possible for you to\nUs and to help others and\nI mentioned before the news break that we've been doing this now for several hundreds and the the number of people that we have fed and the opportunities that we provided is is shocking and really is\nAnd it's it's lovely to think how\nMuch we've done but we can't we can't just stop and ah and say oh well we've done what we can do there isn't the problem doesn't go away\nThere is an expiration date on the help that we give people in the sense that it's a family of four for three months\nSo but they always be another family there always be another family of four and then there's also the next three months right so what we need you to do is focused with us tonight now there's just a couple of little odds and ends and I want to get out of the way so we have it

community\nAnd to help others in the process and it's as simple as that\nAnd because of that every phone should be ringing right now every phone should be bringing because that means that every
