I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now creating the likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate just some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony and typically questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament temperament when he when he was testifying that that should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the road and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that is his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she quit she said questions there that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think sure well we don't have to\nGuess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying well\nThat that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what time it on I had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic time\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if you did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clinton that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan

anyway\nUh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were\n... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of Anita Hill\nThe other argument however is that\nWhat
