our changing environment [noise] the world of personal transportation is evolving or three trends that are developing at the same time cars running on electricity rather than fossil fuels cars operating autonomously\nPeople sharing vehicles instead of owning them\nThere was a future vision of fleets of electrified robo taxis or autonomous cars that will be the go to for many of our transportation needs of course many things have to happen before that vision becomes a reality for one thing before everyone can car pool and self driving electric cars there has to be enough places to charge them all\nRight now there are about twenty thousand electric charging stations in the U.S compared with a hundred and twenty five thousand gas stations so there has to be much more charging infrastructure but if the cars are to drive on their own they also have to charge on their own unique people to plug in charging cables will not cut it\nStarted a company called white trinity is promoting a form of wireless charging based on a system utilizing imbedded wire coils in the ground that produce the magnetic field that generates currents in a coil attached to the bottom of the car the currents charge the car's battery pack similarly to today's wireless phone charging\nSuch a charging system could easily work for autonomous vehicles that simply have to drive to the right location to charge such as dedicated charging spaces where even in taxi lands in airports and similar places records spend\nA lot of time with another lecture cars are on the road\nAnd accessing charging infrastructure they can also act as mobile power banks\nStill balancing the needs of the electric grid dissolve futuristic stuff but every bit of it gets a little closer to reality all the

State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the packages at an address link to him in New

none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a or had the potential to explode and ... are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for a review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be

appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them and did without\nHappening for political or personal

reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency\nIn your mind is it well it's it's\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an interest partly because we literally reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as the so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president sensitive\n[noise] well I I I I Know if I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the ... year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws we passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows him to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de the northern Arab countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was the network that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I'm I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had that I I Do not have any specific evidence in this caravan but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with the new President Trump suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me play when he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nIt's President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's Lucian is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely caught a productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison ... down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but uh that's just what I've heard read news reports [noise]\nLet me ask you about

together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in the package that was sent to CNN the New York all of his\nUh uh the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nYou know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're they're focusing in the investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is where these packages sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by a carrier\nAlso what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents out from the bureau of alcohol um [noise] uh firearms a division and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that\nMassachusetts General hospital managed

News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShall I make and Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment\nBy NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David Hey Audi so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with a several panels about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say [laughter]\nYou do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on the wane or black or white they we like that that was okay as long as you're addressing other character\nAnd that of course that tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply or is it ... one of which was the significant coverage that was given to the story\nOr both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchor by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe owes bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin perhaps the newest co host of today's show he waited as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run a ... I'm ... and it's nice and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and resistance to statements himself\nOr NBC News Germany any lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refuse to defenders well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly it tastes criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\n[noise] well I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to her own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge Fox News host she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction in and a welcome from\nIt's been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall and at ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid\nAn extraordinary amount of money for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you ...\nBack in Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they are definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear and um we do every year unquote which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and following advice Halloween is likely Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costume and comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well\nWalk us through some of the history of this when did we first started ... in America\nWe first start thing in the early Eighteen hundreds on may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people by talking to this came with polish and with court\nAnd of course he's missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad the human condition that allowed slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twentieth century ...

S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and should have known you know you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nAnd so actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations this goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violent or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cups foreign aid to the country's life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground in many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking\nSeveral hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should've knowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prison than in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you\nTo do now I Would tell US President to double down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to reduce violence\nWould be most productive what would you tell them that I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would ask him to hold these government accountable in Central America make those government actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to

new study suggests it also helps manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico do some boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of did it functions Scott America post doc and do some bucks lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the word that you're saying it's important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but doesn't bug says the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear than I could've ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists the neurologist have been missing for a long time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nWe have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking Sarah brother editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who was not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nHappened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of\nSince it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened over time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Syria but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs involved and cognition means at cerebellum is involved in those process to use as well\nAs the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand his up a cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder or have a link to cerebellum\nAnd mom and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work
