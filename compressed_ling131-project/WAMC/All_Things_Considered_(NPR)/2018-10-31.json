are trying to make inroads in the rapidly evolving automobile market [noise] several major auto makers including Hyundai Toyota Honda continue to invest heavily in the technology\nWill suddenly a limited number of cars around the world as the battery electric car market is really starting to take off hydrogen fuel cell cars are just barely getting started\nTo introduce them arise to them for years ago and it's only sold about five thousand of them in Japan California in some parts of Europe Hyundai has sold about one thousand Tucson fuel cell cars over five years the hunter clarity fuel cell model is barely sold as well\nFuel cell cars are electric cars the produce their own electricity using a hydrogen fuel cell rather than taking it from a battery\nThe problem the faces lack of hydrogen infrastructure they're hardly any hydrogen fuel stations anywhere to be found so used to the cars is pretty limited\nBuilding more hydrogen stations and selling more hydrogen cars face a challenging chicken and egg problem meanwhile the main advantage of hydrogen cars is that feeling them with hydrogen there's this fast is fueling a gasoline car which gives them an edge over battery electric cars that need to be charged\nWith the advent of fast charging technology especially the version used by Tesla and it's super chargers the amount of time required to charge an electric car on the road is often no more than half an hour which is a road at the time advantages of hydrogen fueling Tesla plans to introduce a new generation of super charger technology soon\nThat is said to reduce charging times even further\nIt remains to be seen whether hydrogen cars can establish a beach in the automobile market for more information on this topic at other environmental news visit us

can't ignore the contact NATO spent many years is is we all know focused on counterinsurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be re focusing more on its roots back here in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invader\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country has attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume it's fictitious invader is Russia an earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the east and and now it seems to be NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength I was on the ship today speaking with us Admiral James logo he's head of NATO joint forces command in Naples, Italy and he said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic with if you know so we may be challenged and so uh if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nTo whatever all feel go saying is you know if anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been for about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to you and Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric you here and actually the troops on the ground\nWhat we see is that the United states is increasing its presence military presence in Europe would more forces more exercises more pre positioned equipment for the first time those of US Marines headed Norway\nIs with the message here is the United states is still very very engaged in NATO\nNPR's

Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good thing that means that the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen the fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand\nMeanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker the strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are since David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as

himself on something known as the blacklist\nDo one thing that comes along with the blacklist her on her birthday live that uh you're fired from high end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started the blacklist about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust in banking and financial system and part of his was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that with his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the whole loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his

and people will think why are you sure been happy why do you still have time to be happy [laughter] why do you not to go out and make money to pay back your loan\nSo far loud one says you've paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed\nAlone so far loud one says she's paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed\nSo still about one point two million to go but even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked to ... and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court
