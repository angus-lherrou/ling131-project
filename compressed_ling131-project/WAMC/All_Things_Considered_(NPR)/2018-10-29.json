Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bomb to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's I used to rock go is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all those hey there hello so the White House and of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did would condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play the role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief\nUh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy uh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back and making personal attacks the called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any ideas what she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's view the Trump are it seems to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House

Mary Louise Kelly the defense department in sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general tyrants ... see who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is it fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role get no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more car bear a barrier is more razor wire fencing a crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called pasta come attaches which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well ... that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only in a support role again and the plus he's come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others uh we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who is doing everything again from constructing camps

minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq and right and maybe not as many as in Syria and\nWhy is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he should of border security is national security [noise]\nAll right That's NPR's Tom

very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heat it up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr\nIf you put it in a murder mystery framework who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years\nAnd because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo Bullard says the Philips curve isn't working\nBut rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it's certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSetting for pale the fellas\nI wouldn't say that it might be resting [noise]\nA little more central bank humor this time and a pair of reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parity in a cage\nTo complain about such off it out to do for the phone from the city was thrilled with this was really [noise]\nWhen I was looking at what\nThis will throw [noise] [laughter]\nWhen I when I was\nThe Phillips curve could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and on\nThe traditional way in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhether the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nThe U.S economy has extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response owing thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that would come from your belief about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me relevance table inflation\nEven if it means the Philips curve is dead John Ydstie NPR News Washington
