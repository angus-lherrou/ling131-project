dot com\nSo gotten attention manner pres considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of NYU Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I answer about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bill being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\nI'm even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I\nI think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand

suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\nYou know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you [noise] there are few subjects that can divide families more quickly than politics can mother against father father against sun sun against daughter will you get the idea\nAnd then there's this today twelve relatives of Adam ... published

democratic strategist in Wisconsin He says the ad reflects a political attitude in the state and across the country that's become more nasty and pull the right thing\nWe have heard about that it's been said Armand tarp again that what's happening with jobs were divisive politics as literally as a family member it experiment number that I went wow you're that is really just ugly head of the most public where\n... says this kind of ad is bad for candidates and voters because it makes elections less about issues and more about candidates personal lives and Randy Bryce isn't alone in facing

pogo SARS my brother my brother and I endorsed Dr real doctor bill wholeheartedly\nGhosts are responded to that ad by calling his siblings disgruntled Hillary supporters who put political ideology

isn't running for Congress Dr Keith Chen is a professor of behavioral economics at UCLA and co author of politics gets personal effects of political partisanship an advertising on family ties\nWe don't actually have very good survey data on how often it is that families of kind of like deep partisan splits within than we do know that it's becoming more common\nGenerally to study last year that
