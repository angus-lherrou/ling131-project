what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high\nRemind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet provider should have over your Internet experience so typically when people talk about net neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever website you want to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app that you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal\nWhere rising might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix toward data restrictions and these are all rules that

part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration and in each case the story is pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time creating a especially the best course ever created\nOn how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a\nParking spaces were empty and nice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at the place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election noon shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leave\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey ... from their especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency is supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades gotten extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNational Weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it\nThis is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path of dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person has an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upsides ignorance so\nIf you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in this administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who have made a career out of those are people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer I harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note\nWell first let's explain why miss family wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this ... active destruction would come and kind of ease or paying she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her barn is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\n... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure\nOf the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth respects for two and a half to\nTomorrow on

they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but\nInevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions among them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people but Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time
