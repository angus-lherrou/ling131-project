{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "And I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have dealt hooked on this side but I have ... on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nWoman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... burn more but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex as as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nThere were definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you\nMaybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I have a direct connection to them and the republic myself through my family but\nAlso that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love kind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual ... went to United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long but then when she came to\nStreaming support for WAMC come from birch are Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success would weave district to me and gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nProstitution or commercial sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said but he good cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really\nTry to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all the well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intriguing and interfaith guilt\n[laughter] but you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated version of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is and you talk white and you this that and yeah I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America and in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U. S. are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what she told us", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "13"}
