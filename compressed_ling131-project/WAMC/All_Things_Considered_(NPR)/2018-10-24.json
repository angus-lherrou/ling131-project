flooding waters from the sweets glacier in West Antarctica could trigger runaway ice shelf collapse it ultimately could receive levels around the world by ten feet\nA new study published in the European geosciences union journal the cry us we're looked at the feasibility of using glacial geoengineering to stop the flooded the source one approach would be to build a wall underwater to block and warm water from reaching the base of an ice shelf which is very sensitive to melting\nSimpler design would consist of constructing artificial mountains or columns on the sea floor there would not block the warm water but what support to hold back the glacier helping to re grow\nSimpler project would be on the scale of existing major construction projects but in one of the world's harshest

all things considered from NPR News I'm alpha Chang we're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America in a new poll on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said that they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rate NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it at the confluence\nOf the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock lifts you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hurt a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over at school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs\nDeep you know pick up a bear bootstraps mentality Kathy\nEvil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boy hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil sets that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for men does\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nOh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the tide\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year\nWhat are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum

speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nTo share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid in for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people on the frontlines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community is watching all of this is Carissa saw she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think is incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\n... husband grew up here was

husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that hurts so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes or husband or lily leaves dad an uncle and this ... a national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at the demographic like a project in gun
