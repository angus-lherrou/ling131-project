Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party and the White House usually lose his big when the president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young

the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other fronts but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator note that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress that I've been as

love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that it stood up to the president when he has done something wrong\nAnd it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in action not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judge based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent maybe not even the he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he'd keep his independence and Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first but solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like the Adams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year

hands over the bleak future of the American mall\nThat well some malls are emptying out others are bustling according to the international council of shopping centers over the last five years more malls have opened and closed mark Cohen as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school\nHe told me some malls will actually benefit from all those Sears stores shutting down\nThere are triple lays or super regionals as they referred to who are booming who are\nReceiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee because if Sears is still doing business in in their facility they're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully tentative and there are only a limitation is available\nParking so they're losing one anchor star but they've got others can what would they do at the share space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort okay and then there are\nB and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older in many cases they've already lost his ears and the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing in the ... why can't they re imagined the space and at a food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can't manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are striving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type layout that is working for them to pay me a little bit more of a picture of what those look like\nThey're dispersed throughout the United states they straddle urban population center and heavily populated affluent suburban community\nSo they're typically the biggest shiny is penny in the marketplace in virtually every major population centers throughout the United states there is one and in some cases two of these AAA sensors that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out has destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing a landscape in which some malls are disappearing some malls are thriving but all of them are being re imagined in what way is where we'll an anchor store be as important as it was a generation ago people rethinking outdoor versus indoor spaces what trends are you seeing\nAll the Akron store was typically a department store and the department stores genre is for the most part on its way out but now several things have happened first of all the apparel an accessory trends have declined\nUh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that an over large box will act as the draw for a mall\nIs probably outmoded as well in many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as someone like the apple store my which doesn't occupy a traditional hackerspace but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center\nDoes someone like the apple store right which doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center [noise]\nDo you go shopping malls regularly no why when I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and three times a week everywhere in the United states and Canada\nBut frankly I'm there that are less and less
