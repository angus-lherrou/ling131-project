disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working that story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that fate is Fifteen people is a lot to to kill and individual in a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture a show not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit this is U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing 'cause Yogi\nCorrect that the u._s. intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this is what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of plan B\nOr for that to send the teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source wants you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think there's a real\nConcern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm it's come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that visit administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a they trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced the heat sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House in the current leadership and Saudi Arabia\n[noise] when you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the

lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation that have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this court\nThose efforts will now be super sized ... says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal laws\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad network that states and providers across the country or abortion will still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the
