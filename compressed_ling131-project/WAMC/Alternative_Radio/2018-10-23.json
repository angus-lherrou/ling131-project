R. P. dot com\nUm in fact there was one of the golden age of a\nEnglish or agriculture high farming and\nUm but people had been separated from their means of production and we're no longer able to feed themselves and were flocking into this attack meals or to look for work\nWhere they were literally worked to death that is the introduction of capitalism that the introduction of what we call the colonial food regime\n[noise] now this was a great concern\nTo great thinkers at the time and I'll just mention two or something to do with co ops in John Stuart mill who is a very important reformer and who believed in a co-op cooperative victim um as a way of helping people to respond\nTo what capitalism was doing to their society\nUm and of course Robert on a who was a utopian thinker also very much in favor of co ops end of a a planned communities um but\nAnd he was also trying to uh not just sort of reform\nThe ... the capitalist system that was being imposed on Western Europe at the time particularly British Isles but he wanted something different he really wanted something radical he wanted to pull out of the capitalist system\nAny also want to co opt to help do this so we begin to see that cooperatives or tools and different responses to capitalism\nVery few people today actually know what John Stuart mill or rubber own said we don't really studied much\nOwing and crew or the philosophers and and the sort of the wealthy people who were pushing back against capitalism at the time [noise]\nBelong to a very elite level of society and they sort of launched these ideas in what we call the public sphere were there was all this debate in the coffee houses in London about oh dear oh dear what shall we do about capitalism after all\nBut in fact there was another public sphere where people were discussing what the hell to do about capitalism how the hell to stay alive working Eighteen hours a day and not getting enough and literally thing were to death\nBoth the diesel and the fertilizers said you know this is not good for business and their names were forward and Rockefeller\nSo foreign Rockefeller decided\nLet's expand our market so they decided to sell these inputs to the rest of the world the problem was the rest of the world already had food already had working systems food systems and didn't need that stuff so they had to destroy those food systems in order to save them\nAnd of course the discourse we're going to save the world from hunger by increasing productivity so they send out all of these inputs and tractors and fertilizers and sees and I'm into the third world\nBut the third world doesn't have any money how's it going by all these things so banks from the United states loon private banks loan money to the third world to be able to buy all these inputs and they do\nAnd governments are forced to push peasants off land and so basically the industrial revolution is played out again\nIn the third world your tremendous um disruption of peasants societies and they flock to the urban centers looking for work and you get what Mike Davis cause a planet of slums\nWell did you shoot everybody starts over producing not only were producing all this food and the third world we're producing it here too and the bottom drops out of the market and then no one can pay back their loans role in this country in the seventies we lost half of our farmers they went bankrupt the farm crisis\nIn the third world we get the third world debt crisis and so the world bank steps in and the international Monetary Fund steps and says\nYou know you got to keep up your payments\nIn the United states you could just you know repossessed the farm but you can't exactly repossessed Mexico\nSo the world bank steps in and says you got to keep up your payments [noise] um well known you the money to keep up your payments this is public money this is our money by the way the world bank is a public institution that's our money so public money\nStraightening

the money but you have to promise to remove all your tariff barriers dismantle lawyer marketing boards um get rid of of all your or um food crops don't worry about food look wrote in the north dismantle although if you're a grain reserves\nAnd um started growing things more coffee and flowers these things were to get your dollars\nSo you can pay back the banks is this called Neal liberalism you have to privatize all of your state services privatize all of your state run industries put them up on the market will come down will buy them thank you very much\nSo what's happening to us today in the United states happened first\nAnd the third world the privatization of Arctic of education already happened the third world privatization upcoming privatization of the post office already happened for a\nThird world I'm so privatization is basically this new wave of capitalism I'm which we now call Neal liberalism\nAnd a complete deregulation from Minneapolis environmental deregulation um labor deregulation trade your regulation that's with the world Trade Organization it's about we have this this rush of free trade ... the free trade mania\nWorld Trade organization and the free trade agreements of the north American free trade alliance and Central American free trade\nAgreements and you get tremendous over production the north they dumping in this in the south or putting farmers out of business within a year the signing of NAFTA over a million Mexican farmers went bankrupt and why do you think we\nSo many immigrants here today it's because these arrangements these agreements\nThese capitalistic remains destroy their livelihoods that's why you hear you look at who's\nWho's in the back of the house or the fancy restaurants former farmers whose cutting the lawns those farmers who is doing all the farm work all the stupid labor those were farmers so when farmers in this country say oh geez who's going to you know all the farmers are disappearing\nNo there's no no one wants to farm anymore and they're surrounded by foreigners just happened to be brown so what a cough doing well in the postwar period cops kind of you know languished\nBut then they begin to get what I learned was another um second when called the second wave of cause and you get these co ops by fairly privileged people who decide to reject this corporate food regime\nThey want to live differently they want healthy food they want food which is recognizable and they organized and they push back\nAll of these instances of people pushing back is with carpal on your call the counter movement\nThe counter movement is a social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push back out of necessity out of belief for out of survival ...\nAnyway we get the second wave and I'd like to think that the second wave was really part of the beginning of what we today we call the food movement mhm\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nIs comes out of the desires of of Asian Americans it would have very different position and the food system\nBut who find different ways of ensuring their own food security out of necessity\nAnd so today we have a really a thriving food movement we talk about all the time Michael Pollan Alice Waters always people talk about the food movement\nRaj Patel ... pay me um and I think we have to sort of cop to the fact that\nThe food and one of the reasons the food movement here not just because we're rejecting\nA processed food which we should it's pretty bad for us as everybody knows where we're also trying to deal with the contradiction that the richest country in the world produces more food than any other country except maybe China\nI'm\nIn this country when people one of the seven people are going hungry we don't call it hunger recalled food insecurity and there's a special\nWay of measuring it might not [noise] um if you call it hunger you won't go to us the grounds and I'm sure you have to call it fruit and security\n\nBut one in seven people in this country so that tells you right away that hunger is not the result of scarcity\nWhy are people going hungry and the richest country in the world with more food than anybody else because they can't afford it and so hungry maps very closely with poverty\nHunger also maps very closely in this country with rich so the highest levels of food insecurity\nIn this country are among people of color we have a racialized food system and this is one reason we have a strong food justice movement to deal precisely with this kind of inequity\nNow it turns out that the figure I just gave you one in seven hungry people in the United states reflects perfectly how many hungry people that are in the world about one in seven people\nAre going hungry in the world in fact depending how you measure it it might be much greater\nBut by the standard um a means of measurements from the uh United Nations\nOr one in seven people are going hungry now you're a lot about from Bill Gates and others that we have to go to Africa and we have to say Africa from Hungary we need to take the new green revolution to Africa and Africa Africa Africa where are you guys are interested in Africa\nAll of a sudden oh well African never got a chance to for the green revolution it's not true actually agreement wishing failed in Africa but in fact that if you really want to end hunger\nThat's not where most of the hungry people are most of the hungry people are in Asia\nAnd Pacific why aren't we talking about that because they already had a green revolution and Asia and Pacific that's why so they bring revolution isn't just about expensive inputs\nFertilizers and hybrid seeds and pesticides on the green revolution is about exchanging one food system for another exchanging peasant food systems for capitalist systems and so logically and historically as it always has it displaces end this\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no poll dog hornets invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... sent two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\n[noise] so I've been talking to you about the capitals food regime and say to more thing one is\nWe know some things about capitalism people have been studying it for several hundred years and one of the things capitalism always does it gets that goes through a period of liberalization and then a period of reform liberalization\nThey take the gloves off the market's market gets to do whatever it wants new more rules think of the roaring twenties\nThinking today Neal liberalization and this other states society but it concentrates a lotta money in a few hands but then people can't take it anymore encounter movements rise up and they push back and they demand reform\nOr they demand revolution which is even scarier\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog hornets in that did to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nSo what we need is a strong counter movements why didn't we get reforms that last market crash they've all the money to to the banks bailed out the banks what about the people because the counter movement was not strong enough\nSo what does it have you done brothers and sisters take a look at things we've got about two million farmers we have more people in jail and then we have on the land we have\nLess than a million agricultural workers forty six thousand people working in processing plants but three million working in retail grocery sector you put all these together that's a fifth of our national workforce\nNow that's interesting from an organizers point of view from disrupt his point of view from a reformist point of view from a revolutionary point of view twelve percent you can check things which represent ... percent is\nAll the globe the in 'em all the corporate food regime controls\nGlobally they controlled ... percent of the food and with that they control the world's root systems\n\nNow co ops don't control much of the food in this country I Know\nAnd farmers are two weeks to demand anything but people who work in retail grocery that's the biggest employer in this country Walmart because some part in this country\nWhat if we were to converge in all of our diversity how powerful might we do and I'll end by saying that the counter movement as far as we're concerned is the food movement it has the progressive\nWing and it has a very radical wing and the corporate food regime has two wings when you're a liberal and one reformist\nAnd it's a counter movement expects to introduce any reforms much less transformative reforms it'll have to converge the progressive than the radicals are gonna have to converge\nThink about the different types of co ops that I described they're all represented here but which ones should come together my position\nIs it the progress is in the radicals need to come together because if the reformist in the progressive to come together than the Contra moving to split down its back and it becomes a week thing and it will never be able to introduce changes\nThe reformist ones bringing Senate changed the two week why because the neo liberal or hedge demonic this is the age of neo liberalism what's keeping us from coming together I Would say there are some historical obstacles we need to deal with\nOne would be sexism and there would be racism and another would be clashes and\nWe have to deal with these things brothers and sisters we have to take them head on we have\nTo be fearless we have to call it out I have to call out my privilege is a white male and I have to allow people to call it up right here right now everywhere we've got to dismantle patriarch\nStraightening support for WAMC comes

dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nBust apart we will never come together and if we don't come together\nWe will not change this thank you very much [noise]\nI was just a curious you said there are three million grocery workers you know uh this this statistic of service and restaurant workers that we could add in there as part of the food\nOh yes I Do but I Can't remember [laughter]\nYes and there are some excellent organizations like the restaurant opportunities center that organize restaurant workers\nUm by the by restaurant workers have some of the highest levels of food insecurity in the nation and the highest of within that sector or in the fancy restaurants\nI have a question of all the inconsistency that me and my friends discuss brought many systems but the people in this room all respect from saying about this one so we have an eleven thousand members that are small cooperative upstate New York\nIt occurs to me that those eleven thousand members although they raised their hand to say they want to be part of this shift in food systems\nTherefore one case their retirement plans their stocks and their bank investments are at the same time more than likely supporting the structures that you discuss\nRight we realize is in our school board work in my community that the people were coming to us demanding security in the front of school buildings\nHad not checked her all the ... to see whether or not they were supporting Remington\nRight so how do we begin to expand this conversation so we stop eating the tale of our own snake\nWell thank you that's not a simple question is is [noise] I think I I really do believe that that reflects of action\nNeeds to take place within the public sphere is which we consciously created I think that we need a radical public spheres I Need we need public sphere is deeply rooted in community um and these issues have to be put on the table and you know people are going to get defensive\nUm but we can't not address those inconsistencies a and I think that the only [noise] there's no easy way but I think that as we understand the structures which has driven is to this dead end\nAnd to the contradictions in our society into the violence that we experience in our society as we understand the structures behind that and call them out I think it deep personalize things enough so then we can begin to address the very personal issues as well\nAnd I think that you know there's a lot of trauma trauma um built into all of this\nWe can't just address it intellectually you can't just addressed that organization like every one of us has to do some work whether it's about internalized oppression or whether it's about the guilt of privilege\nWe can't get anywhere if we're if we have these anchors on us which means we do have to do the internal work the good news is you don't\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog

S. dot com\nAnd constant constant work on genocide there are excellent forums and workshops and um for dealing with\nRacism and how to dismantle racism\nFrom both sides of the oppressor envy oppressed and the same is true for a sexism and patriarchy so I think that to the extent that we can begin to bring these into our practice or social practice whether that's cooperatives or whether it's research like I Do\nThere's no guarantees on this you know we don't know what's going to happen we don't know if we can avoid planetary collapse civilization will collapse the planet will go on we won't we don't know\nBut what if we didn't even try what else are you going to do it's time to change everything were you busy\nSounds intimidating but what else I've been doing this stuff for a long time and very much for a position of privilege to meant trend tremendous mobility got educator I never thought I Would I mean I grew up as a farm worker but I'm the only one in my family\nBecause of
