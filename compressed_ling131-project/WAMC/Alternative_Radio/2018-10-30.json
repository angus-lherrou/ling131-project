and verifiable fact into a culture where fact is inner changed with opinion\nWhere\nAre skillfully manipulated by corporate forces to elicit emotional responses\nTo everything around us including manufactured political personalities and we confuse how we are made to feel\nWith knowledge the problem in American society\nHas been orchestrated by corporate forces by of corporate coup d'etat in

no\nInstitutions left\nWith in American society that can authentic we be called\nDemocratic that we live in what he describes as a system of inverted totalitarianism and by that he means it's not

these corporate forces\n\nTen years ago\n\nWe suffered a severe financial dislocation\n\nAnd what was the response of the corporate elite\nThey created out of electronic ether according to researchers at the University of Missouri twin the six trillion dollars in fabricated money\nThink of what twin the six trillion dollars could have done in terms of putting people back to work\nMaking sure that the eight million families that were a victim from their homes had a place\nTo live forgiving student debt creating a rational\nAnd their homes had a place to live forgiving student debt creating a rational health system\n\nWhere parents were not forced by corporations to go bankrupt trying to save their six children\n\nAnd the speculators these global speculators they took this money they never

highest\nTax brackets for the wealthiest individuals and corporations was Ninety One percent Ninety One percent [noise]\n\nAnd we now live in a system whereby next year we'll be pain over three hundred and fifty billion dollars on interest and within ten years nine hundred billion dollars on interest\nAnd the gamble\nFracking industry aside from destroying the water\nOn which we depend for life\nIs money losing operation\nTwo hundred and eighty billion dollars because the fracking industry like the dot com industry has value not on the profit it produces but I'm projected profit\nAnd this money this twenty six trillion dollars of money marks calls it fictitious capital because it will evaporate is borrowed that\nVirtually zero percent interest from the fed in Europe there were central banks that negative interest rates meaning they would pay to borrow money but it has to be paid back and since they're not producing anything of substance\nThey are imposing\nHarsher harsher forms of austerity and debt peonage on a beleaguered population that no longer has a voice within the society\nWhat we have done to our students\n\nCrippled by monthly payments in the hundreds if not in the thousands of dollars unable to find meaningful work\n\nAmerican productivity since Nineteen Seventy three has increased by Seventy seven percent and if wages kept pace with productivity the minimum wage would be over twenty dollars an hour\nAnd yet\nOver forty one million workers in this country or in less than twelve dollars an hour that's a third of the workforce and almost none of them have employee offered health insurance\nThat's by design they are extracting\nIt from us even if you have health insurance in this disastrous for profit system\nYour co pays what's in\nInsurance in this disastrous for profit system\nYour co pays what's not covered astronomical pharmaceutical\nCos\nAre draining you\nA million bankruptcy is a year\nAre caused by\nPhysical reality no longer matters you can have pictures of his inauguration crowd next to a bomb and he still has the largest inauguration crowd you know\nAnd that's very dangerous because it further accelerates this division in to a world where facts are interchangeable with opinion that we honor information only based on how it makes us feel as Aaron points out\nIt creates a kind of schizophrenia within the culture because the facts or in front of you and yet they are denied and denied and deny\nAnd I blame\nThese electronic hallucinations a I worry about this\nAnd I blame\nThese electronic hallucinations a I worry about the severance from a print based culture rooted in verifiable fact the books are still there it's ... I mean I used to wonder who's right Oxley or well\nWell it turns out they were both right 'cause first we got ... and now we're getting the iron Buddha or well because the ... ruling any allergy of Neal liberalism no longer has any credibility across the political spectrum so what happens when empires decline\nThere are familiar characteristics one of them is of course military fiasco such is\nNow the Seventeen years of warfare in the middle east so all late empires engage in military fiasco and the ancient Greeks invaded Sicily their entire fleet was sunk most of their soldiers were killed the umpire disintegrated\nThe danger is severe economic mismanagement which we already face but the day the dollar is dropped as the world's reserve currency than the dollar value plummets\nI'm not gonna play no stir dominance with dates but that it's coming is is a fact and the military machine has to contract and empires are always fragile entities because they depend for their well on the exploitation of foreign labor and the ... of foreign natural resources\nAnd you you saw you saw it in the feeding them parts of the city's writes the tyranny that Athens imposed on others that finally imposed on itself\nAnd that's precisely what's happening and you use the harsher forms of control and the outer reaches of empire a wholesale surveillance suspension of a basic civil liberties including due process militarized police militarized drones it all comes back into the heart of empire\nAnd and my fear and Cornel West and Rick Wilson I've been going around doing these series of talks based on great revolutionary thinkers rows of luck some bird Antonio ... Carl Marx WB to boys we didn't Thomas Paine for our first one because\nWe cannot separate ourselves from the wisdom of the past\nThat is our patrimony that's our\nUm you know you can go back to Aristotle and Aristotle understood that you can't have a democracy in an Olive Garden system as Aristotle said once the oligarchy seizes power then you only have two options revolution or tyranny that's it\nAnd what I worry about this land of the eternal present and the land of images is that we're cutting ourselves off from our intellectual heritage at a moment that we desperately needed [noise]\n\nYou've spoken of the need for spiritual awakening since humankind can't agree on who are father that's not politically correct God is or even whether we have a father do you think it might be time to remember\nOur well that's good or mother surely we all can agree that were children mothers well this is the guy or this is really the guy a theory by Lovelock\nUm that the earth is is a living being\nEvery society has a concept of God\nBut that concept as a human creation and they in doubt the eternal with particular attribute ... depending on whatever religious system you'll come out\nBut they all know that there is something beyond us there\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nGive life and on which we depend for life\nAnd that our time on earth is very brief\nI mean human civilization in quotes has only existed for ten thousand years since the end of the last ice age and the very peculiar elements of the biosphere that have made this possible polluting the Gulf Stream\nFor most of the four point five billion years the earth has been have not been existing\nCoal Hallows seeing this moment bean now supplanted by the ... so it's about being in touch with the sacred it's about\nHonoring protecting the sources of life and understanding that our life with a life\nUs is intricately linked what do you see is the role of third parties can we afford to risk wasting our vote in twenty twenty [noise]\nWell to quote the great Emma Goldman is voting was that effective it would be illegal [noise]\n\nIf we don't rebuild our movements it doesn't matter who we vote for\nPower is the problem I agree I'm In that sense an anarchist powers always the problem we are a terminal heritage of power we must remain organized hold power accountable as Ralph Nader has pointed out the last liberal president in America\nWas Richard Nixon not because he was a liberal or out of conscience but because he was frightened movements and there's that's how we got oh show the mining safety act the clean water most of it written by Nader and there's a scene and Kissinger his memoirs do not buy the book\nWhere it's Nineteen Seventy one there are tens of thousands of anti war demonstrators Nixon has put in the city buses all around the White House and he's standing at the window sane Henry they're going to break through the barricades and get us and that's precisely where we want people in power to\nBe [noise] so I vote\nBut without movements real movements and my problem with Bernie is that and I ... I Want and I were whiz Bernie before he announced\nAnd trauma was pushing him that he had to run as an independent not only are we not going to gain power through the Democratic party which doesn't function as a real political party and which stole the election from Bernie\nWe're not going to build an effective opposition within an election cycle it's going to take a long time it's going to begin in places like Eugene it's going to begin from the ground up\nSo race or ten years ago now the ruling party of Greece was pulling in four percent so you know there does come a moment and we just have to stand up on principle because if we don't begin to stand up nobody else will\n[noise]\nThat's a good question real solutions to homelessness but it raises the cruelty of what we have done to people with mental disabilities um we have thrown them out on the street or you can\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nSoon as they get in prison they drug them up so they sleep Eighteen hours a day because it's the only way the prison can cope is by plying them was psychotropic drugs but it's just\nAnother example of the cruelty of unfettered capitalism the way this society ... one of the wealthiest society still on the planet will discard people and treat them as if they're human refugees including of course children\nHow many high school students are homeless how many college students I mean children living in shelters\nAnd that's why this system has to be\nOverthrown and let me spell it out for the homeland security that's O.
