WCBS news radio eight eighty along with the candidates governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Mark ... the first question because there was a toss we'll go to the governor\nBut channel and first I cook for you of the guidelines there are no opening and closing statements you'll have one minute to answer a question in thirty seconds to ...\nWhen warranted and Governor Cuomo as I said you won the top so you've got the first question I only go\nFor many the cost of living in New York state is just too damn high why can't you know one hundred and sixty eight billion dollar budget and give people some tax relief you know big businesses often cut their budgets by five percent to save money but not heard their core functions so would you commit to doing that and pass the savings on to\nYour taxpayers a well first sank a WCBS and or a baby for sponsoring this debate I heard that line somewhere before it's just too damn high\n[laughter] I Can't remember where I heard\nA you're exactly right the cost of taxes the cost of doing business in the state of New Yorkers just too high and it has been for many many years\nThe formula is simple if you want to lose weight\nEat less right that's the formed it's just hard to do it it's the discipline to do it or would we have done over the past seven years Marcia is we have caught state spending to the lowest increases in modern political history are increases are now down to two percent\nThat is lower than any governor in modern history\nLower than Democrats or Republicans George protective clothing so for conservative wears down to two percent federal auditors to cut taxes middle class taxes are now down to the lowest level since Nineteen forty seven corporate taxes Nineteen sixty eight manufactured taxes Nineteen Seventeen but that's only half the store\nThe real estate tax or the property taxes\nIt's three times the state income tax and we have to get local governments to control their property taxes for example duchess county uh my opponent over seven years raise property taxes fifty eight percent\nThat has to stop I pass they two percent cap\nOn counties big two percent cap on town the other end of the state cap is making a difference\nBut I have a follow up question before we get to Mr Amano because you keep saying that you've cut government spending but it still goes up and what we're asking you to do is to commit to spending less period so that the money can go to taxpayers\nLook I Am a bit of fused in the Democratic store any second I've been accused as you know in the Democratic primary because you were there\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no ... no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nThe spending is less than George Pataki who call themselves Republican conservative I Am always worked in a to reduce cost for the get those taxes down we have to but three times the taxes come from the counties and that's what we have to ...\nMile an hour responds absolutely thank you all for ah for hosting us a governor where that only true ah in fact to\nYour budget increased spending at about to an annual rate of four percent each year so despite the fact that you continue to suggest that you've been able to hold the two percent you have and\nAnd what you've talked about in trying to drive down local property taxes is dishonest this state for forces more state spending on to local property tax payers than any state in the country which means local property taxes school districts counties towns villages fire districts arbitrarily high because you have\nNot been willing to take on the responsibility of driving\nDown those costs I committing today as we have during the campaign to reducing property taxes thirty percent over five years it's achievable it's possible\nIf only Albany where to control it spending and reduce what it forces down to a property tax payers now as far as it relates to my record it's nice to talk about what happened Twenty years ago or Fifteen Years ago but the last seven years is that just county executive uh we've been able to streamline county government with modernized and deliver deficiencies and we now have\nCut property taxes each of the last four years and on Monday I released a bunch of the cap that cuts property taxes the fifth straight year in real\nTime itself Richland has\nAn edge because when I wrote in I just make a comment because he shows me of\nA you're making of numbers again like some makeup facts or not or write or there is no four percent increase is who percent it's been documented you're in the county legislature for seven years in Korea voted to increase property taxes ... I live with it you were in the county ... trip for seven years let me finish\nYou voted to increase property or ... county spending forty five percent vast where the taxes\nCome from the government and the governor hours\n... two minutes and he's now down to where they are\nSir and the reason that county spending increase during those years with all due respect just because the state government before we imposed finally a Medicaid kept continue to four states financial\nManagement or laughing do your best friend again except you know it just now started not Ninety I listen you can make up numbers if you wish but I served during in the county ...\nGovernor first of all the years that you're referring to you weren't not governor I I've been in office since Nineteen Ninety five let me finish my thoughts are we have we were able to hold spending in state and county government mandated expenditures continue to rise now to the same point we also economic growth at that time so the average\nTax bill for duchess county taxpayers while I was a member of the county legislature decreased but over the last eight years we've seen total economic stagnant say which means communities are getting to assess valuation growth and property taxes are going out I committed a thirty percent reduction over five years in a move\nOn which I imagine a cell phone taxes raised utility taxes you spend more you call yourself a fiscal conservative you're a fiscal fraud are done more fiscally then Republican conservative government in you know governor we have to move on and\nRichland and I'd just like to get a question here in here edgewise I'm just a moment are on the Republican Party is hallmark has tax cuts\nGovernor we have to move on Richland and I'd just like to get a question here in here edgewise I'm\nJust I'm On a narrow your Republican Party is home markets tax cuts\nYour Republican president just got tax reform passed passed passed that impacts New Yorkers most negatively greatly reducing state and local tax deduction source solved how do you explain that to the New York homeowner who always thousands more in taxes\nSnacks plant today as I did one the bill passed I I opposed assault deduction path because they didn't put us uh certainly high tax states that a competitive disadvantage it also abandoned\nWhat had been a commitment since the civil war but the problem in New York is that we taxed too much we force too much spending on the school districts not the town's villages and ... and even within the city of new our property taxes continue to make us less competitive and the governor has done nothing to reduce\nThe cost in able enabling us to reduce property taxes I Will the other is we identify waste and in our empire freedom planned that we would provide\nUh [noise]\nYou to say in yours\nThis was at home and I'm kind of a series a\n[noise] for you to say in your situation\nTo point fingers yes people in my administration made a mistake they went\nTo jail your county legislatures calling for an investigation on you for kickbacks and perjury where you gave a contract to a vendor and then a family member got a job\nAnd they got another contract that's your own county legislature asking for a criminal investigation of you so I wouldn't point fingers\nI find that entirely ridiculous and by the way governor not factual evidence Ellison governor well it's not the actual let me finish my ... my parents were not going to\nFirst of all what you describe has been demonstrably pull proven false false or and and it is highly highly hypocritical at best for you and your chief assistant joke for cocoa making phone calls from your family\nMember or the money in your pocket this is a bribe or ... ... talk sir it is not you've had it's been demonstrably per proven false and I'd like to finish that have died on your pocket no sir I have no idea what you're talking about the take um an employee's salary didn't go in your pocket after you and\nGiving them a contract and they don't have a second contract it failed to Marsha Marsha ... has a class a governor let it out at that level of\nA charge and he has been out speaking or almost without without ... without a part of me what falls joke for cocoa making eight hundred and phone calls from your very office if you're a made phone calls they shouldn't ... you were there ... ... is this is this very day all day while he finished\nMy memory stuck on this is about you know lend me your right always saying I did anything wrong they're saying you took okay let me stop William both changed pay to play\nYes yeah how how come on the governor established a more lean commission and it was supposed to root out the root out corruption and when it found it was going on in his own administration he can do it I Will absolutely\nReestablish immoral and commission I Will ask people like ... to serve I Will use that as the tool to hold back the forces in Albany who think it's okay to defraud people butter your administrator and eight nine individuals now found guilty you can't possibly expect the voters of the state of New York to believe\nThat you had no idea they the exchange state funded taxpayer resources for campaign contributions crystal Ron getting twenty five million dollars worth of state and for our project already underway in exchange for campaign contributions ... it is highly where you get a new line for a moment while you were going to change\nThat you know how people would believe it because there was a two year investigation and every us attorney said I had nothing to do with anything I did absolutely no I mean while you're the one who is being called on for an investigation for the fact that\nWhen your part that is not when you had a family member employed by a contractor who you gave a contract and then you lie about it on the disclosure form a new cannot deny it actually took crime my friend Esther ... view Chris still\nJoe Sally G L E s mark Marlon our that is untrue sir you're going to lead\nA leap in with a question for the governor\nSo governor we all see the tragedy of homeless people living on the streets everyday\nMany suffered from mental illness that police are prohibited by state law from removing them except under the most extreme conditions would you support changing the state law to allow police to take homeless people off the street against their will to get them help and shelter for their safety and the safety of us\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no ... no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nAgainst their will that runs right into a civil liberties and civil rights conversation that is very important to all New Yorkers the law says when the weather reaches a point where you could endanger the lives then you can bring them and\nI Believe the problem is a very smart they don't want to go to the shelters because the shelters are are unsafe if we make chauffeur's safer with more services\nPeople will come in they don't want that I've talked to them for Twenty years they don't want to sleep on a park bench in Grand central they really don't but the shelters are unsafe and that's where we have to focus making the shelters safe for with services so we get the people out of situations that\nThey don't want to be governor your time is that Mr Amano you have thirty second rebuttal\nI I think I got a minute to answer the question that I I Would hope I mean I I Know it was well I Know where you\nWould at a thirty second we're a bottle I think is the rural\nWhat we need to invest in in the mental health services that have been dismantled over the course of the last two decades that means\nEnsuring that those who live on the street have the support of state and local governments and what Albany needs to do is to coordinate our response that means crisis intervention training mental health first aid means making sure that those who are struggling with addiction\nMental illness have a support structure unnecessary certainly shelters need to be safe but at the same time the governor has allowed the dismantling of mental health services at people finding their way to the streets when they really need help and what we knew in my county and I want us to do state wide as a comprehensive response to really strike at the stigma related\nTo mental health and provide long term support at the same time Marcia it means it means we also have to ensure that we help those those are limit the amount developmental disability and their population has skyrocketed in homeless shelters and we need to support those are well\nWe're just one second basis so hypocritical for you to sit here\nAnd ... to Donald Trump\nMini me of Donald Trump who is decimated health care in this state taking health care for poor people cutting Medicaid cutting mental health services room ... health insurance from close to one million New Yorkers and say the answer's more healthcare surf\nOkay I live I stay in fact I'm surprised I took him just want to go there but sir I've\nBeen an elected office for very long time I was in office before you I was in office before me out of Sean lifetime\nYour to your you know your private\nYour private law firms represented Mr Trump and his real estate interests before state agencies while your father was governor you excepted sixty thousand dollars for Donald Trump and have haven't\nReturned it you when you were trying to make friends with the president when he first came to office told them you wouldn't run against them and use our had him at your bachelor party I didn't so at the end of the day so I had a long record of committing to help those who are most vulnerable I grew up on our you know you don't support Donald Trump I saying that I'm absolutely committed\nTo the delivery of mental health for Donald Trump let's get out of this conversation Donald try\nSupport anyone who is going to effectively negative ads Arnold Trump Mr Bean you

I Believe needs to occur statewide is we have to invest effectively\nOr in the appropriate or a representation of the time of arraignment\nThe time ... and throughout the judicial process we need to ensure the individuals who are trapped\nIn the criminal justice system have a support structure so they can find their way back to society and not return to die to jail or we do that in my my county over the course of the last\nEight years the governor has forced more and more bird not to local jails across the state of New York forcing them to grow their population that's not a way to reform the government is houses they\nHave already sat there might have found a has a ... is a mix a factual statement is by mistake a idea to\nDisagree with the parole boards release of Herman bell and he knows why does your part is is a pure white as your partner you gave him a conditional pardon you didn't you wouldn't agree to name it and then\nIt's an independent board could very well you should know if you read the law number two items prior to the ... entire point of view\nHad the same position I Do on legalization but in the midst of a Democratic primary decided to have your department of health a New York state's department of health change its position when I'm governor we don't make decisions based on political experience we do it based on science data in fact\nOkay and you're on this up and you get there for the job that I have a lot of that is not a it is not truthful it is true or miss a mile an hour but not supporting medical marijuana and what have you done a decade ago oh so you didn't support it I support the expansion of medical marijuana today but I did and\nWhen you were in the legislature which was my point and you said no\nSo you live but I don't there is not the first time I did not we're going to go to Clinton I did not have the health department the rebellion Fisher I asked for study for the first time ever and they came up with a Sunday rushed it ahead of them are very rude matters more\nAs a chef and here's a question for you ... who is critical to the Democratic process and a growing economy what solutions would you offered to troubled school districts like the one in Hampstead Long Island\nWhere they spend the same amount as an average school district but the high school graduation rate is revealed in a CBS to documentary is a dismal thirty seven percent yeah the the the\nEducation state why this is so dictated from Albany down that school districts and teachers don't have the latitude to it\nTo establish outcomes and then achieve success so I Believe in devolve into some of that decision making sure that school district parents and teachers have the relationship necessary establish outcomes and then create by the way a curriculum that gets kids inspired to learn that includes by the way investing and vocational training and technical\nTraining so that so the kids learn differently have that opportunity also it means reviewing our financial structure of the way in which we fund education so that we don't continue to see failing schools not\nGet the resources they need but our education system was once great when there was a symbiotic relationship between family community\nAnd ... business in education we need to ensure that educational outcomes align with economic knees and economic goals the other is that this state has perpetuated a separate\nBut unequal form of education general ed and special ed I Believe in integrating that because those who are living with special education needs those living with developmental
