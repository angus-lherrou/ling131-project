Blacksburg who is also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe Syrian satirized in Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that is a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut when season one of bull jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rose show [noise]\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nJob which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agreed to raise three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and sacrifice and not good\nBut the family comedy struggle corporate America went on the air for nine seasons star of horses around ... is our guest ... ...\nIt is good to be here Charlie\n[laughter] ... Blacksburg welcoming the fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYou slit later when he did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be excused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to a lot of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening at the headline the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know look at bow jak who is such a mess and all of the Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or played in in this clip by patent Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark a melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of the story beats would feel modeling or soccer in or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and its brightened colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some funds surprising ways\nI liked it sneak attack into sadness and said in some fun ways [laughter] everyone was like that's the kind of sadness I like the fun of her [laughter] and and jackets\nAnd such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt at the plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the currency then didn't five which you wrote it I'm an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dimension and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is well or not as low jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horses around seriously though hold your applause\nWill held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah limb\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network has no maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was being Olivia's life again it of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted anyway the horse to water be careful\nLobes of the way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moved to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced because ... ...\nOf course is jealous when the mom says she's moved to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced the cliffhanger is Olivia gone for good\nReporters because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hits like all the way home getting rides from Mr T. alpha ... stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not have a ... on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show\nHas to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's coughing you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when you said early in that clip\nThat um he ended our our fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem Abul or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurts so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least are really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement which sounds so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the lead for\nSure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men\nUh last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things\nAnd they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe more forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so I feel like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for\nYears and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her\nIs use of of racial slurs in mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know we see carry a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nAnd I guess since ... Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bull jak horsemen after a break he'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season one\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new collection of Eleanor Roosevelt advice columns and Terry Gross and fresh air [noise]\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff and new series from the creator of Mad Men starring John flattery Amanda piece all riser and Catherine hung a new episode every Friday on prime video [noise]\nAnd from Rhodes Scholar and not for profit offering learning adventures for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at our oh eighty scholar dot org slash retreats\n\n... would\n[noise] support for NPR comes from the station and from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company family owned operated and argued over since Nineteen eighty proud supporter of independence solved whether that's on mine over the air or in a bottle port Sierra Nevada dot com [noise]\nAnd from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros\nAnd book appointments online at home adviser dot com\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Rafi out by Blacksburg and he's the executive producer creator and show runner\nOf the Netflix animated comedy tragedies here he's a bow jak horsemen which is now being shown on\nReruns on Comedy Central so watching that series especially like after the eulogy episode I would've thought that you were a bitter mental at a very troubled childhood\nReading about you a little bit my impression is that was not so your parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the U. S. um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of a kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nSo my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob\nAnd it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area and so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I\nAnd and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority in the community that I was in\nUm she would always bring home stuff from the store often it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were shipped 'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that's as happy Halloween because it's missing an and have the the misfit toys and\nUm it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew\nAnd you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them in cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know if actually one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nYes or sometimes you know I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in it\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave and you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know\nYou have and you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time\nThat I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect to this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say the thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is TV like a safe space for you or you can like\nYourself on TV and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that\nIs that like that so many pop culture references and they'll jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm that made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate\nIf I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in feel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto that don't have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by ...\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nSeries now that Comedy Central there's rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you because you\nIn retrospect like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter]\nCable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks ha and making the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "17"}
