of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred tromp Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nI'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\nAh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars in loans um which is on top of that\nIn um in today's dollars of quakes two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw about ... what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to his father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nIt also see that when he fell and then when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nAnd the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his company has their either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casino that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing a bad it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money history and a half million dollars worth of it was not a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino chips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father is well it's actually a new well and this call to sell to the wheel it's taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald is the sole executor French I'm swell inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dry\nSupport for streaming WAMC come

Frank ... own at the time of his death out they're awesome clued all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both of the buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire\nAnd it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over seven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learn through the ... the documents that we went through that dot sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars then what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from ... million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy family as you are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to\nAvoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just under state tax returns\n[noise] I'm just saying I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all it actually going on in ...\nGet to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all it actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or other come back [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of the American Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of a sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mock of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a ... a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession\nOf one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map\nIt actually cause it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately uh the uh The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried shrimp belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true and the documents are there and and a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this just sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three report is working on this story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into law\nOften everybody except that the three reporters working on this story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access to were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who is allowed\nTo go [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [noise] [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was uh just\nThe three of us for a year um with ah yeah that's a pretty messy [laughter] for ...\nAnd a little claustrophobic here I'd imagine [laughter] and other people know why you were locked up in the room [noise] um if people", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "18"}
