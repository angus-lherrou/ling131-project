the NC double a billions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does money go\nThe money largely goes to be adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches to make as much as a half million dollars a year\nAnd a thousand or more players a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they're being scout it not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters who are there to sort of see what's in it for them\nAnd the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day they're exploitive their dealers in human athletic flesh and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I

college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an

did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know these\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back in the business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nBut you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\nBut then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players who are already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this\nSo in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to

three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people

year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at present time that was a shock ...\nAnd has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\n\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college\nSports explain

football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nA while to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be just in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity\nI think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity\nI think they'll become more careful sunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these
