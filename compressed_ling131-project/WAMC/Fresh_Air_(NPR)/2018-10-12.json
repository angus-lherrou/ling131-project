thought of it that way I I I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising and no one knew what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a\n[laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people didn't like other gay people it was just re [laughter] it was hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outsider group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy is how she pronounces it I'm not so I I was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line and we'll have to Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force

who aren't familiar with divine who in this film that you're referring to play a Jackie Kennedy devine was a you know a very heavy man who who usually played a woman in your movies and pattern himself
