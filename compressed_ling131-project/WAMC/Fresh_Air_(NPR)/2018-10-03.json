clinic\nNo way in hell and doing that\nWe should at least you think about it [noise]\nI'm not saying that we would do it if we could just explore the idea of how we feel like a list of all the pros

mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nDifferent yeah it it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of

with some strange catheter divides saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter]

timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah you mean blaming myself yeah when you like the body and Catherine my [laughter] and get her ... in\nYour head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori is time ever said that exactly you know she's really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her\nI think for a lot of women when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nOf away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter]\nSo maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that to go to graduate school and film and trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not\nTo having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't

you are forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband you said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also and he was very unique character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character as your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it\nI and and then it was sort of ...
