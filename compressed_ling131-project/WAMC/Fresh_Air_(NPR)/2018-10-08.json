your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my

been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading of homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill

private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as the sun but as a fan of your father's work I Would say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they haven't been that have his work has a life outside of his mouth\nAnd his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems so I go and then when you get on record as say oh I Know\nAnd I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah on many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men\nOr that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and or an exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about reading the poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book in absorbing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice\nSince

just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing at ... um but but you are you at your father was a song writer seem must have had an awareness that time writing to craft that something people actually did\nAnd you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I I I was a five year old uh on the side of stages watching them being performed a heartless going out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and you scrap your record that's an amateur move\nTo the amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground\n[noise] were you and

would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm he's reconnection to people um I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father's savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like feeling so we'll just sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nHe often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with a song in poetry um and incredible\nThat [laughter] that with the canon of his work with his devotion to black cutting pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this ah this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic
