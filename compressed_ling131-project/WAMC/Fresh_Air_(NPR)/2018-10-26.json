Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved and the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out\nAs a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWere mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also a lot of ground at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I've got a con around the block\nThe anything he was on a like fluid and has actually yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter\nAnd [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and but I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of Lou but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gaze habits you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Louis kind of open to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist\nIf I did want a guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran or exactly yeah\nKnow and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap and she was saying a guide you ever want to spend money we were living in these all these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said what would your father ever given their money that she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know if it's anything for you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand would ever lose needed anything he was there and you know that was one of the ...\nLose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and you know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister you know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his arm he didn't have any money not each that he got a job working for his father typing and his father's accounting office yes extending ... granted as that [laughter]\nI Try to let it they don't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to buy time in making money and if they were they had over ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story what did he was confirmed as but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship it was a\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names that was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of ... kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they ... didn't work for lead\nLet's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know and says like we should have a banjo rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know and you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for ...\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio decided that the the velvet underground what kind of too boring looking\nSo they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be singer too young to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that but I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of visibility\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports as patient as much as he could\nYou know um she only saying you know a few songs or the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could have gotten you know he kicked Nico has the band as well after having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York\nAnd that was a year or so that was one of the issues with Warhol\nA Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time Warner was in the newspapers all the time they're not\nYou know not art critics writing about it and will do that too but just like August crazy guy you know he thinks they're terrible soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspapers or whatever you did got attention\nAnd uh you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in a\nYou know rock and roll certainly back that was a pretty Ernest thing and we are we're whoa seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a bat and you know for for people who have been hurt them yet you don't hurt our amazing there so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know that needs to be more professional operation and you know there's no way of the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nMy guess is Anthony ... Curtis the author of the book Lou Reed uh life it's just been published in paperback after a break we'll talk about ... relationship with women\nHis wives and its trans partner Rachel I'm Terry Gross and this is ...

I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about [noise]\n\nHolly came from Miami ... hitchhiked away across the U.S they loved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was a she says he they\nTake a welcome and while I was I said hey honey ...\n[noise]\nCandy came from\nActually read walk on the Y. outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm\nSo that so that was actually a hit friendly read but it from your book like this attack he wanted to hit so badly finally has any sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know they were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire he'll look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible they're good to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more government to get out of that yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits you know you got a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you\nKnow the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do pick another walk on the outside or walk on the wall side again and you know that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nA you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh and ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a harsh and depressing record 'em [noise]\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do a\nTrip to restore his standing once you have destroyed his dad you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record it uh\nRestore his standing once you have destroyed his dad you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album and a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career it was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that would ... before Lou did it and I'm\nLike I never wanted he wanted to have is music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm In his ... you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one\nThing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly or in the song street high fell apart call slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview again at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of I'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise] you know\nOver the course of two or three years Lu got clean\nOr got straight and um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways of song like Halloween parade or a you know there will be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um\n[noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different accept F streets hassle them not to slip away part that you referred to sure but the part about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to it yeah it's great music and it's great writing\nI'm so there there's the middle part [laughter] a a street hassle trying to say anything about this this part\nI'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead or in the street or has been thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose\nStreet a has been thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was the idea died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they got dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks I'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nOf a blue turns that male character which were female character and then you have described the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his guts to get just girls body out of his apartment\nLet's hear it this is ...
