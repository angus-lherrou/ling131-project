and trash talking\nThe skaters are played by pros but the skaters they play are unlikely to get anywhere they have no money no connections\nJonah Hill welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie when did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nI'm no ambassador for skateboarding and skateboarding is so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um\nTreatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I dunno just laid an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot\nWhy do you think it's a natural draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something\nPunishing about that in self punishing about that and there's a great reward\nThat is true we earned even if it's just for you where are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate very briefly in a time where I think\nI invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life and more emotional [laughter]\nGood for you [laughter]\nYeah I'm\nScars on cars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just the general reckless niche which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this is it my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and on learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use or dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered an escape or now I landed\nA kick foot in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of\nMy life let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it said among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right\nBack and we'll talk about some of the films he starred in after

Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever tried to many in one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried to meeting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early ...\nTo the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was a sin filed since a young age my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael way to Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mine I knew that was not going to work so Homer is\nA K [laughter] I like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like when are you going to go legit you know [laughter]\nBut ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny and I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that\nYou have the M fishing or the or or even I guess\nThe wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine than when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're at another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we're so ... you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids it's all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids with a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids it's so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it um a friend of mine who ice skate board with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nI think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York\nThis is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a ... and what he would tell them that I did so big and but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also asked about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch it as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess this Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd marine car again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old

then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon Jenner people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal plate and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't we hear a scene\nFrom a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for
