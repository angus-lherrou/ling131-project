heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nWhat did you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for

and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used a full scale replicas of these capsules they were the you know we're sort of exactly the same size all the details were\nExactly the same our production designer Nathan Crowley did incredible job sort of rebuilding these things\nAnd we ... we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to\nAh and we would set those up against a giant ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off to set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know it was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the novelty rail and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh distillery in Haitian and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we uh Ryan I both wanted to try to make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up in question [laughter] not not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to\nDo what did we ain't getting ... from we we had to take a we had to\nTake a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about the sound design\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nI mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a\nSort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audience is whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon fright\nMassive puts together a ... and about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and tell you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space helping their land on the moon but if they don't ask don't get they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nYear and Heinz who plays about Gilbert movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture the late in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent of that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they are live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilot\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the

[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's music he actually\nBrought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that [noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah so it's\nIt's a less Baxter piece called lunar Rhapsody yeah and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect and Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah I'm In is incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate of the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know ruin or might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you [noise]\nWas a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned the Jim Hansen's book that Neil likes this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous ... music that ah that Neal and so the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece from about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a than Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level\nUm would kind of unexpectedly play this track that really no one listening no wonder Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would it have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet

been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh\n[noise]\n\n\n\nAtlanta Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and in ... in the new movie first man which has directed by my ... who also directed la la la land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and they found remarkable was that you were working on the land before first man but a lot of land with a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man ah and ah so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a three laws stops and starts and and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with that and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way I also if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you had to deal with like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real science and then miniature it's it's it's\nYou know la la land with a complex film but that's because of like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level [noise]\nI mean I think everything you described gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing that\nA ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know
