woman says she was sexually assaulted by someone she knows behind a closed door and the men denies it\nThat's an issue of universities have been grappling with\nMy guest financial group gory artists is the author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus over the course of three years she interviewed a hundred twenty students from twenty universities spoke with nearly eighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports\nShe says that while writing the book she witnessed a historic moment when survivors moved from the shadows to the spotlight burst on campus and then nationwide with the me too movement\nGory out as as a contributing editor at the New York times magazine in Vanity Fair and has won a national magazine award\nVanessa grigorian artist welcome to fresh air you know you write in your book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with the me too movement it spread beyond campuses\nWhat'd you the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread I guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators and the Judiciary Committee\nHad gone to college campuses what'd you think some of the things are they would have been told about ... what to take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by as the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault\nYeah if so senators had um ban on college campuses as presidents or administrators or title nine officers they would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is very few women make it up\nWhen he was afraid she'd be smothered today she was afraid that she was going to be killed unintentionally

is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students had to me that they weren't sure if groping\nCounted as sexual assault maybe it had to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of the three years that I deal with completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this\n[noise] so um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes etcetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's in it\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd from looking at this and researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistance to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that is an ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question um the really hot to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness twenty me\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until they ended up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever\nUm but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances and you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes you like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little dorky okay fight it it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party like to go out and dance and I\nRecently you know guys try to come up and downs with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency

you know try to come up and downs of you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I mean why his arm around me and say oh yeah I get it consent and I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nBut that the first time that happened here that was definitely the first time for me\nI mean I ... yeah I I didn't\nThink that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him I ... in um I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who truly a\nYou know are in night clubs or at dance parties a lot understand like this is

I Want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly sexual power and I am inviting you to really focus your gaze on sexual parts of my body\n... and again you're going to see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nIt's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with a young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is that some power and or is that China grading um\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place

completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is empowering or is that China grading um\nAnd you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism item my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self objective vacation isn't that just a\nA rude isn't that just somewhere justifying on this kind of\nWay that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up with these kids I interviewed in college just graduating now\nYou know Brittany spears was like\nThey were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with so\nThey don't have the same ideas about oh if I dress the way it makes me look like a slut because this is the way people dress and now there's such a casual way and you're right and a lot of concerts of a beyond say or\nKaty Perry re on a you know it's it's crossing the line way from scanty to something makes release actual but this is what they believe is empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nHuge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised them like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that but they were adamant and with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves\nShe read in your book we're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom an area where feminism has previously not been able to reach so attached to explain what you mean by that\nI think that raising of demons that has been going on through the meat you era is allowing women not only to save these are the things that happened to me in the past that I might call sexual assault or I might just called things I was extremely uncomfortable with and now going\nInto the future I Want to be treated differently in the bedroom I Want to be asked what I Want I Want to be able to say no tonight and have that actually be heard I think that they have are always kind of live behind attitude shift we're definitely in the honor to shift now\nBut I truly believe that that kind of most private ah is beginning to shift\nBut ... thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you so much Terry Vanessa ... is the author of
