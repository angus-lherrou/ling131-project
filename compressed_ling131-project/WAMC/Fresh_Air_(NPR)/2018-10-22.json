the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross that comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and none of\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone Brits old data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and I said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we are things like this do happen and I said if it's less about growth for growth and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movies saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact that like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] what's going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes and so your mind is really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended\nIt wasn't intended it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for

maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why do you not [laughter] but\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ...

didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do he didn't say All right you know what I said was that we need to

career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nIt when you went into a regular comedy club or something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nHe's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your job off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you has any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like it just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just like OK buddy you know God\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since

this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they've stopped talking what was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take your shirt off and like and I would do vote for him and talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the actors if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping as Washington Times oh my God so I\nThere's the light oh ... ever present or not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men I would've flashes climbs up yes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the ... other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking and the light kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make

you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good role because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like what it who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I was just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like Carl\n[laughter] Sam feel I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she\nAlways a bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now [noise] every little\nIn ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys they're happy to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think it's so important for me to its its branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on her show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role in Kenya\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "22"}
