Parkland, Florida\nJust a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhaul of the schools to merge in response to climate and the data shooting in television and if you wanted to watch it on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think we could have been more prepared than\nI mean they knew what we knew what\nDid the training they were they\nWere such an open question\nDo the Robin sent me when\nTalked to teachers about what was

an enthusiast to plan our belief in a good hard\nThing and then\nOnce she and other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills oh a little bit over two days in January teachers were talk\nAnd we want to go back to ... you know what's going to be annoying when the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and so through all the emergency procedures for\nFor every ... every black and this is what we do in for two days or two days we went over to much to do it with each and every law because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like\nThey were out in October day they would get it on a burgundy\nAfter the two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually did for another second in our doorway still confused then she went to her left all the way down the hall to set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshmen building looking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that\nAnd it's there they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nYou know it was

she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the town how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gun shot sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was laughing there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise] [noise] [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol I follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder you kind of Seventeen over twenty five and ... and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway ...

three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she tax she's on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend ferrets as\nA drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been grazed by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway I'm without really quiet um I had it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on\nWhen I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key um and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police\nAnd then the police evidence that this is a police anyone in here\nAnd then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police have anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the hands all and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter and I know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the

evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shooting for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare\nBut now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook for what to do helped\nNow I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I'm moving to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of the\nWays they could have been better prepared Melissa for instance one a trauma kits with God's in every classroom and
