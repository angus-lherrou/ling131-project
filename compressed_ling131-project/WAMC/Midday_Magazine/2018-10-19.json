can Sin City land bank land banks are designed to be able to bring 'em foreclosed in abandoned homes I'm back\nTo life on the renovation and reconstruction and get them into the hands of folks looking

are excited about\nA lot of city leaders and tell me leaders across New York open complained about moon the from the coast of Maine split or imposed by New York students I have a problem for you as you make a budget\nMandates put a significant strain on all of our budgets or many of them are for health and safety reasons and we understand that a others are\nUm you know stagnant state aid and other issues that we all face\nAnd so what we have to do is we have to just be more creative and we have to work with our um public employee unions we have to be able to work with our community to figure out what are the services that the community needs and and we have to balance all that and we would love to be able to have\nA you know more state aid or we would love to be able to have um you know less mandates\nOn but we do recognize that we have to work within the regulatory framework that's given to us and we just have to buckle down and recognize that you know by switching out all of our street lights to Eli ... you know we'll save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and electric off and those are the types of savings we need to be able to keep our budget flat and you know as

our three public employee unions and so both CSPAN or a firefighter unions um we're working on police that we hope to have that done soon but all of those contracts were designed to be able to\nUm be fair for the employee recognize that cost of living is going up all of them average around\nA two percent pay increases a and that we believe is fair and it allows though additional employee give backs and uh to us in terms of health insurance costs and so in the end um we're able to have um three hundred employees that work\nAdditional employed give backs and uh to us in terms of health insurance costs and so in the end um we're able to have a three hundred employees that work hard each and every day to deliver the uh important services and it's done so in a way that you know our taxpayers can afford\nIt was it difficult to make a city budget up when you haven't seen the state budget which doesn't come up for another two months\nYou know much of what we rely on I'm a ... in terms of funding for our budget um come from property taxes and sales taxes and thankfully sales taxes growth has been strong and New York state and an officer county and so we were able to you know increase some of our sales tax revenue\nA are unrestricted state aid has been relatively consistent and so even without knowing the state budget um worry about it you know generally predict that it's probably not going to change much and so we have to kind of factor those and\nUh but we are also very competitive and the world of grants and so with this budget we created in the office of grants
