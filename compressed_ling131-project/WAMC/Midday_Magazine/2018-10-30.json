year old so it's not like I haven't done it before but I I Will say that um the context or a there's a lot more challenging this year you know the overall environment certainly given the national tone\nA is not what I'm used to and I think some of that's percolated into the state races and local races as well there's a a I'm\nA ... a ... a an anger among among candidates you know I'm I've let alone you know from from from the voters that uh the the opportunity for a thoughtful discussion of issues um it seems to be disappearing and I think that's a very sad commentary on the times that we're living in\nWell look I take it anybody who knows what they're doing when they're running for political office thinks every election seriously even if even if the outsiders and saying come on and\nYou're going to cause victory\nYeah but you know um [noise] you can't take anything for granted I mean the voters\nAnd that was the lesson of twenty sixteen nationally for the Democrats or you know the Clinton campaign took a lot of folks for granted especially in swing states and although\nYou know the majority of Americans voted for the Democrats if Hillary Clinton in those swing states you know Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio a lot of folks that voted for Obama felt they weren't being talked to any more they were felt they were being left out they were angry about a lot of things\nAnd they they certainly ensured that everybody took notice cars and they are they voted that so you know certainly for me obviously as as one has been around for a bit and raised you know more

territory of you you have to give the Republicans credit even in the worst of times they're much more disciplined unified group\nA I think from a state perspective there has been more unity uh certainly working with the governor and his team we've had a unified effort as we've headed until the fall\nOr you know the governor went into a you know what what could have been a very challenging primary the numbers and they ended and show that but certainly the dynamic was challenging\nI supported him you know from the beginning he's been supportive of my re election to St James has become a
