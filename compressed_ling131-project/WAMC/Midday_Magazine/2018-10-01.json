looking for people and groups that are already somewhat established to work together in concert\nWith other groups while they continue to do the work that they're doing\nAnd what we're hoping is that this ... these coalitions will then support those groups in achieving their goals as well so we're not just looking for them to say OK let's do good government\nWhich is vitally important but we also want these coalition partners to then back up these other groups on the legislation that's important to them\nExcept for example if there's something on the environmental side but you have a group and part of your coalition that cares more about the campaign finance reform and that same coalition to then get behind the environmental costs\nExactly that way they're much much stronger\nHe speaks to

had expertise in marketing um but you know given the\nAmount of resources that we have available under the ground I think it puts together a a pretty you know impactful way to utilize the are the remaining mitigation funds that we receive from the gaming commission\nNow that the plan is very much not just an image campaign it's it's proposing that you promote specific events and attractions in North Hampton to a targeted audience can you explain how that differs from you know perhaps a traditional marketing approach\n[noise] yeah I mean I think the uh you know I think the focus is really um on you know ah\nTrying to first of all trying to compile and cure rate a lot of the existing um marketing that's happening you know individually by individual stores and institutions and then calendars and trying to kind of\nPull those all together in one um central hub\nUm and then trying to push that out to people and I'm In a targeted way um to to just try to make sure that north Hampton is on the radar of of people that\nYou know may be coming to the finer valley again to to visit the MGM casino or an moving up along\nThe uh the Ninety One court or a north and south and again just trying to make sure that people understand the the sort of unique can authentic experience that\nThat is north Hampton and um and try to make sure that it remains I'm a you know a an option for people who are who are visiting the pioneer valley\nThe plan is going to focus or knew Shirley on on downtown north Hampton is that correct but then the ... but with the with the hope that it will then eventually kind of spread out and benefit the entire city\nYeah I mean you know it just generally downtown where we have the highest concentration of um you know of of our of you know entertainment um are are ah you know restaurants are retail\nA cultural events concerts things like that but it's I wouldn't say that it's exclusive to it I mean obviously will\nWill um will also include some of the other attractions you know the city as well but you know initially um you know we again\nCertain small amount of resources trying to figure out how do we most effectively um deploy them and so you know starting a small but obviously the longer\nTerm strategies I'm hard to not only expand you know spend spend the breath of it but also to expand into other potential media or you know more traditional advertising if you will um further down the road that's yet to be determined\nYou mentioned a small amount of resources you're talking about the one hundred thousand dollars that you got from the Massachusetts gaming commission to mitigate the impact of the empty and Pacino some of that's been spent now to develop this plan so you have one how much money left to actually\nImplement fly about about eighty five thousand dollars and will that will that cover what you need you think well again we you know part of what the plan or\nAttempted to do was to say this is how are you know this is how we would recommend spending that eighty five thousand dollars so that the plan kind of provides a road map for that um and it obviously and it goes on to say that you know if if you were to go beyond that these are the things you may want to focus\nSo that the plan kind of provides a road map for that um and it obviously and it goes on to say that you know if if you were to go beyond that these are the things you may want to focus on um you know they ... as I as I've said this was um in the city is is\nApplied for the ... and as you know attempting to sort of be a catalyst for getting this marketing\nA effort underway um but I've been clear that it's not something that the city can necessarily sustain or or manage itself the goal is to have our our partners in a\nIn the business community that you know the chamber that down to entertain the association et cetera\nUltimately you know own and sort of carry this ball you know forward um the city of is she wants to be supportive and help leverage um that future hopefully that future um sustainability with this grant\nHave you noticed any impact I mean I I'm sure there's no data available yet but at least anecdotally have you heard anything from from businesses in in Northampton who say we are being harmed by the casino\n[noise] um I have not heard a I have not heard that uh that I think that everyone anticipate that you know the you know the casino that you know the opening of the casino is going to draw a lot of people just people that are\nYou've been following the construction and want to see what it looks like and I think anytime anything new happens\nYou generally get a a a strong surge um so I think people\nWill be waiting a little bit longer to kind of see you know after the first six months year et cetera\nTo probably better understand it um you know definitely have heard some of some anecdotal stories about about um you know staff or you know being hired a you know or you know just\nSenior staff for example you know bartenders I'm you know a moving taking a job at uh MGM a in a in a higher level like management position et cetera um so there'd been some anecdotal stories like that but but I haven't heard anything directly in terms of\nWhether it's had an impact on anyone's bottom line which obviously one of the reasons we're trying to be proactive and and um why we applied for these mitigation funds and why we're trying to create this marketing planet so we can be proactive so that you know um it doesn't it's not about\nNot an either or proposition that
