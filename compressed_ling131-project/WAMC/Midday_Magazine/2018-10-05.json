before you came here lock stock and barrel\nWhat's your assessment of the situation now and and what do you see going forward some sort of policy or procedure to try and ensure that there's this doesn't happen again that there's more communication between the police and the people and now the screening and and all that\nI saw the communication was a key piece of it we did a great job first of all the um the the investigators in the ... and the police department did a great job investigating the issue commander ... who is serving as in acting chief at that time did a great job of managing the situation\nI think going forward we need to look at communicating and how we communicate the timing of the communication the substance of the communication and we have issues like that\nIt's important for me as a police chief to really bring the sides together because it's very easy when you have issues like this they're emotionally charged to have your community in your police department\nThat really start to work against each other in a situation like this and really exacerbates things\nI have to serve almost as a mediator and things like this because I'm seeing it from both sides I'm hearing it from both sides I hear the pain in the frustration from members of of the community who who are looking at this from a historical perspective than it is it pertains to law enforcement in certain members of our community\nI hear the frustration from my officers\nYou know officers that I've worked with for a for almost three decades and that these officers but officer with being in law enforcement for that amount of time and I know the dedication and commitment of police officers and I know what they do and\nHow it impacts are officers in the law enforcement profession in general when you have officers who were generally trying to do the right thing and in fact a lot of cases in most cases do the right things and have criticisms from the outside about some of those things and so\nI've got a kind of bring those two sides together so that we can kind of see so that the two sides can kinda see and appreciate the challenges that the other sites have\nAnd I'm In that way as we move forward\nWe can work a lot better in terms of resolving the issues and some of the underlying issues that um are associated with these sorts of things\nThe state police ride along program how's that going are they still riding along with officers and how's that working out\nWell they they still are and it's not every night and it's certain nights and we have a you know two or three troopers that a ride with different officers that throughout a shift\nAnd I think it's a great partnership I think it's a great way of of agencies working together and sharing resources and information and and skills and tactics and in order to resolve issues in the community\nWhat one thing that's great about it is that the state police to understand that they're not policing the city of Albany\nNow what they're doing is assisting Albany police officers in assisting the members of the community and I'm In in helping to resolve some some things that are that are occurring in preventing other things from a current and in the community [noise]\nIt's a great community relations tool for the state police to you know because now the community and the local police officers understand that there are partners that the state level\nAnd they have an effect of the matter is the state police as an incredible amount of resources and um to to help with local municipalities municipalities\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nRight when I talk to the officers and the commanders about it they they all say that uh the partnership is working wonderful and they hope to see this continue for some time\nAs anything about Albany good or bad surprised you since you arrived here\nI was surprised at how hard it is defined juice bars in Albany\n[noise] you know [laughter] I always had a a a bunch of them around the area was in a\nMediterranean restaurant them having a hard time finding finding those around but you know it's I'm not not a whole lot surprise me I knew it was a very diverse community you know I Know it's when you have a a capital city you know there's a great deal of energy and action that that's happening in in that type of community\nJust some ... research at a new geographically that you know the city itself was with diverse you know yet if you want to you have rural areas of the city type areas you\nUrban type environments and so not a lot has his really surprise me but what I've been pleasantly surprised with is that everyone I've met no matter where in what's setting that I've met them they've been very very welcoming and in very very accommodating and\nLooking forward to working with me and having to work with them in order to to make things better and so it's been a pleasant experience so far\nWe have a new year coming up you're going to be doing some planning for the police department I Believe yesterday when the mayor gave her budget presentation she pretty much said I don't know if these were her exact words but she said she was kind of like leaving the police department budget alone so\nYou can like structure things the way you want what are your plans for the year to come what would you like to see happen within the Albany police department\nWill well first I Need to solidify the executive command structure in in the police department um because many of your listeners know\nAfter the chief retire and left the deputy chief of some of the acting chief role and the deputy chief rank at that time was vacant and then the acting chief who was actually the deputy chief retire and so there was no chief there's no deputy chief\nAnd so I came in as as chief and um I don't have any second in command\nAnd so first thing I'm In one of the things I've been doing right now as I've been getting out and working with community and learning the officers learning the community learning the people in the city is um is trying to figure out\nUm exactly who will be in some of those critical positions in the police department and I'll have a um so the upper command structure will look like a chief\nAnd two deputy chiefs and then I'll have the third layer will be commanders that will flow off those deputy chief and\nAnd so right now and I'm I'm assessing and evaluating the or the talent you know in in the police department and and I'd need deputy chief so that that second layer and the police department who share my philosophy of\nWorking with the community in order to resolve issues also working with the police department the members of the police department to ensure that our officers and and are not sworn personnel filled value\nThat they understand that there's opportunity to create an environment where everyone within that police organization feels that they can contribute in their ... their skills can be maximized and that in general they feel valued so that they go out and they're treating our community the same way\nAnd I and I see some some great opportunities or I Will be restructuring the the other parts of the police department to make sure they were\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOr um for the members other police departments sworn in a sworn to get involved in this it'd be a very participatory type process we're a cross section of employees and personnel in the police department will all be able to get involved with this and had been put an influence with it\nAnd so it's an it's an exciting time since any time for me is an exciting time for the members of the police department and they see that uh there's great opportunities\nThat is all of the police chief Eric Hawkins who spoke with our capital region bureau cheap they look as you can
