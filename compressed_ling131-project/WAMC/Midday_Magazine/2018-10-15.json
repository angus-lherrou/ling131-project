passed a resolution that cold in the mirror to explore insurance options do to keep the range open\nThe reason that the mayor said that the gun range what's going to be closing as of January with because our insurance would not cover so the council unanimously in the um public safety meeting a decided to write a resolution to the mayor recommending that he does explore those options\nThe announcement of the closure has led to a spike in range users and city council meeting attendees\nThere's eighty two members of the gun range at this point that are key hold members\nAnd it is a substantial amount considering that\nYou know there are people that go up there for recreational use that they're very safe they cleaned up the gun range they have a you know a position that that that something that they want in the city and it was a pretty large um shelling and you know we've probably had at our city council meeting more members in the audience for\nThat agenda item that we have for almost every other one that I've been on\nCohen joined the council in January she said if the question of keeping the range open was one of insurance the council was confident that a reasonable solution was in hand\nThe people that are up at the gun range had had a quote I'm Perry has quoted she works with an insurance agency and she caught at seven hundred dollars a year which is a

the\nBernard initial estimate for ensuring the range range from six thousand to Seventy five hundred dollars a year\nIt's within their rights to offer that that statement I've I've obviously read it

is portrayed in film\nIn a few short weeks a midterm election will be held across America it's outcome will be directly linked to the outcome of the most recent presidential election on so many levels\nAnd according to various sources millions of Americans did not even bother casting their vote in two thousand sixteen\nPerhaps fifty percent of all Americans voted or maybe it was closer to sixty percent but the bottom line is that in ... voters did not vote and this despite all the nonstop pre election coverage and the media\nWhile now how does all this translate cinematic like\nWhy do certain films stress the significance of each and every American voting for the person or persons of his or her choice\nWell let me side a movie that dates from two thousand and eight\nIt's titled the swing vote and its plotline grab my attention not only because it was released during a presidential election year the film stars Kevin Costner as Budd Johnson a loser who is not so much has been as a never was\nThe one bright spot in his life is precocious twelve year old daughter\nAnd as a result of a series of events the winner of a presidential elections will be determined by one vote that would be his vote\nNow of course one might expect that those in power will pander to Johnson they want to be winners and not losers because after all winning at all costs is the American way\nNo upon hearing the plotline of swing vote I immediately thought of a similarly theme film which was released way back in Nineteen thirty nine that film is titled the great man votes\nJohn barren more stars is Gregory advance a character who is different from Budd Johnson but only superficially Vance is the south but he also was Harvard educated and a former scholar and he has two children instead of one\nHere the election in question is local rather than national\nBut his one vote will decide the outcome\nAnd so of course the pop us politicians and their handlers cozy up to Vance one of them is named iron hat McCarthy and he is perfectly played by Donald McBride a long forgotten character actor\nMcCarthy is a political operative who possesses as it as explained a useful talent for stuffing ballot boxes\nWhen we first see him iron had is handing out candy to children but this is not because he's fond of children she does so as he explains because they'll all be voting a straight ticket one fine day\nNow I could go on and on here but what's swing vote the great man votes and similar film stress is the significance of voting in each and every election and by each and every voter\nIn the U.S every vote counts and there is no excuse whatsoever for any American to become a two thousand Eighteen version of Budd Johnson or Gregory advance\nStreaming support for WAMC come from
