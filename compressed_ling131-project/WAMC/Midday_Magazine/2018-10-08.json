this could in part\nExplain rising atmosphere Rick levels of greenhouse gases somebody Williams she's Hudson Valley to retrieve Alison done spoke with Peter Grossman coauthor end of the study and senior research fellow at the Cary Institute of ecosystem studies\nAnd analysis of long term data from Nineteen eighty eight to twenty teens how the following\nThe capacity of soil to remove methane from the atmosphere has decreased rather markedly over the last between Fifteen and Twenty years of monitoring and that's a it's a super interesting result and and we were then curious to determine what why is that happening\nAnd it appears to be linked to changes in soil moisture so in the northeastern part of the United states has been raining more over the last\nFifteen to Twenty years or so I end the soils are wetter and wet soils a have a lower capacity to remove methane from the atmosphere\nAnd drier soil and the reason this is is the best thing is in the atmosphere the bacteria in the soil and in order for the bacteria to get at the methane and eat it they have to be able ... that they're from the atmosphere has to be able to diffuse into the soil\nPore spaces are these bacteria live\nAs a soils wet than the fusion is inhibited and the bacteria have less access to nothing and so the the methane take down\nAnd when methane uptake goes down it contributes to global warming Kauffman says the lead author analyzed more than three hundred studies of methane uptake by far is soils around the world\nAnd so we end up with a with a pretty strong um conclusion\nThat the capacity of the the the amount of methane that's being pulled out of the atmosphere by far soils is less than we thought than it's been going down over time as the climate is changing and rain falls and sing\nAnd that's an important result it it it means that our our ideas about the global methane budget needs to be revisited a little bit where we live we think about the global methane we have an idea of how much methane is being taken out of the atmosphere by soils and we think that that number is lower than previously thought\nI Would suggest that the methane concentration in the atmosphere they rise faster than we thought it was going to and the implication is that if we want to stabilize the methane concentration in the last year we're going to have to work a little harder\nAt controlling some of the human sources and so he was sources of methane you have a natural gas extraction and transport and there are leaks associated with natural gas extraction transport if we're going to stabilize the methane concentration in the atmosphere maybe we're going to have to work a little harder to reduce those leaks\nOut we have lots of methane comes from um from cattle production when race paddle they produce methane more cattle we have the more methane we have\nA we may need to little work a little harder\nTo improve the efficiency of of cattle production who'd want to stabilize the methane concentrations yeah she's a lot of methane comes from rice production rice patties\nOr there's a lot of work to still produce the same amount of rice but reduce the amount of methane is produced so we may have to work harder um again if we want to stabilize the concentration of methane in the atmosphere\nOur results suggest we're gonna have to work a little harder we've been relying on these natural processes to pull methane that the atmosphere\nAnd maybe we can't rely on that as much\nGrossman addresses what's next\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med

by conservatives and liberals alike today and the IRS is an assistant professor at Albany law school and director of the government wants center he worked as a clerk for the Senate Judiciary committee between two thousand three and two thousand five\nAnd also worked for Judge Sotomayor as she went through the Supreme Court confirmation process professor airs looks back at the Kavanaugh hearings\nIt was dramatic and it was very difficult to see I worked for two years on the Senate Judiciary committee when I was in law school\nAnd I saw a number of hearings I actually had to miss Kavanaugh's hearing for the circuit court because I had to go to class but the Senate Judiciary committee has always been ground zero for ugly partisanship in the Senate\nIt's a striking contrast to the courts which are above politics in many ways what changed with this confirmation hearing I think is that\nTraditionally that partisanship has stopped at the nominees table the nominee themselves has had to be themselves has had to be above partisanship to insist on rigid neutrality and adhering to the law what we saw with Kavanaugh was\nOpen a tax on left wing conspiracy that he believed for bringing forward these witnesses against him and I think that's going to infect the way people see him as a justice\nAnd what's still up in the air at this point is how does that affect the Supreme Court itself going forward does it further question the courts legitimacy in the eyes of litigants and the public\nAnd how does it affect future confirmation hearings are we going to now see I'm nominees openly campaigning in a political way for the seat you know a lot of insiders were shocked that Kavanaugh went on Fox News and published an op ed in the wall Street Journal those are things that normally see nominees stay away from it almost any cost\nNow that he is on the court one of the big concerns for those who are opposed to him is roe v Wade how do you think based on his ... his judicial record\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThe seat you know a lot of insiders were shocked that Kavanaugh went on Fox News and published an op ed in the wall Street Journal those are things that normally the nominees stay away from it almost any cost\nNow that he is on the court one of the big concerns for those who were opposed to him is roe v Wade how do you think based on his ... his judicial record how would he considerate case in abortion cases maybe not necessarily roe v Wade itself ... perhaps some related issues\nI think the distinction you make is exactly the one that most experts are making that we're unlikely to see a direct overturning roe v Wade itself at least not for several years what we are much more likely to see is\nUpholding incremental restrictions that make abortion more difficult to obtain\nMore expensive to obtain and more rarely offered\nAnd that seems almost a certainty they as you know the current law on abortion is not just robot a case called Casey that says states can't unduly burden access to abortion but unduly burden as the lawyers phrase that can be interpreted to mean a lot of different things and we saw Kavanaugh\nIn a case involving an undocumented minor\nSay that it was no undue burden to require her to find a sponsor outside of the detention facility in effect somebody to adopt her before she was allowed to get an abortion\nI'm so he's willing to say that many infringements on access to abortion or not an undue burden and I do think that's going to throw some a power back to the states are states like New York that are more protective of abortion I think we're likely to see a lot of attention to their own abortion laws\nWhat are some of the other major issues that he may be part of may decide upon that are expected to come up well\nWe're going to see cases on gay rights transgender rights the environment the Supreme Court touches almost every important area of American Life for there's really no limit on the number of issues that they could handle the real question is where is Kavanaugh going to be different from his predecessor Anthony Kennedy\nWho was very conservative and it when I was in law school we never learned that Kennedy was a swing judge or justice we learned the Kennedy was a solid conservative who had a libertarian streak [noise]\nUm but there's no question that Kennedy was a solid vote in favor of the right to abortion if not an expansive right to abortion\nOr that he was often a swing judge in environmental cases and I think we can expect Kavanaugh to be a solid conservative and now that there are five conservative justices or the oldest of whom is Seventy that's Clarence Thomas this is going to be the Supreme Court for a generation going forward\nI heard one commentator on National Public radio suggests that a Supreme Court justice is really a reflection of their life in the belly ... students who changes her perspective on things and makes her rule differently ... how do you think this the judge Kavanaugh will rule considering his wife and the the nomination process he went through\nI think all of us are formed by our own experiences and just to sit on my door and I should say I worked for her before she went up so I watched her nomination I'm a as somebody who felt very close to her\nSo I'm a biased observer but I think she said that out loud and took a lot of flak for saying that our experiences

suitors in other words let's never have a nominee\nFrom a Republican president who turns out to be a liberal vote on the court all of those experiences said to me the Kavanaugh is going to turn out to be pretty much what people expect him to be that said before you're on the Supreme Court you don't have to decide\nHow willing you are to undercut well established precedents like grow and so we can't
