job of playing Carmelo soprano the the the wife to Tony the\nMob at once that I was you know and it was an audition like any other and ah you know I kept in I I knew I wouldn't be cast because I was at a county an American woman which\nI happened to be but I guess I never really thought it looked very much like that yeah and so there was a circle ear that came during the audition and\nUm and I got home and they called me that night while me that I had gotten the thing that we did when you read\nThe script for that first episode a guy walks into a psychiatrist's office yeah uh did you think well this is going to be an enormous cultural phenomena little chain\nLetters on for decades to come oh my God ...\nYeah\nOne of the things that we knew and we actually back in the ... interviewed some of the actors in the show and one of the things that everybody would hear about is that every actor in the Sopranos was terrified\nThat some day the David Chase or the other producers would say come here we got to talk to you and they let you know that you are going to get worked for that right or your character they didn't actually kill any actors as far as I Know\nOne of the guys who got killed and I will not say all of a sudden after that episode they started getting all these letters from Japan saying oh why did you kill off no one's above a which seems sort of unusual and after a period of time it was all traits back to the actor\nHas got to hand it to him\nHe tried he trying to get credit so you went right from the Sopranos and you did this as well I don't know who's right from the front as ... as you did this new show on Showtime called nurse Jackie which I think about a nurse who had a among other things a drug problem and various other problems have you ever like
