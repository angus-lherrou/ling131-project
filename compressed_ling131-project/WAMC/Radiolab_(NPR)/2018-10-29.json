I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbia school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSearching Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist some newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think there is and he's he's been so focused on the Internet it's pretty close down for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people do they tend to twenty three three men and women go camping in the Adirondacks pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty they made up of ...\nThree men and a woman go camping in the Adirondacks pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty they made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up too tense and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nTo campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got the\nOther campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again I'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook them into the woods near brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he type so after we had the four people tied he went back to\nThe first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled voice\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing don't believe ski with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in a cat\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had them lay down in a ditch next to\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come\nMen that the other two camps are the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Freeman laying\nDown in the ... when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun get kind of stood up\nCalmly a coolly walked into the forest and us began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies and state police standing by it was the scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and they come back with an id have\nThirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York as a fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday to feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the\nDoors are short of our people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving round here but people left the area so fast I don't care that lasts\nA short of art people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they love\nBarbeque smoldering they left behind coolers so as a man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Guerra\nDeep freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and Carol started running\nLow block fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but they took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing but he wouldn't talk and it's at this point\nThat the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor release alarm and again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording it so the guy at the center of the conflict was a man named\nFrank our money frankly each arm many Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use it or even a but it is or money\nA couple of months ago pretty through Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York the Germany now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk away\nThe Pfizer I like ... flights go fights like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for or defend it you're fighting the state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and uh I just had the feeling that this guy is dangers and love of the things are going to happen\nThe car and we take off to go look for the bodies Guerra\nTold the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mine ... mine ... about an hour south of the hospital ... federal runners so in that moment where you scared were you excited like oh you're a ... it's a high but you're scared you're concerned yeah fear ... food\nIf you do in fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little that we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talked to her ... her car\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try to lose the trails\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nWhich may be as far as we can walk up to the old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren my chemistry and Tom supervisor of ...\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and towns supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father because it's on a road that goes to the mind it or what have you have to their minds [noise] it was then it's sort of hilly area off the side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly the there were no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in\nHere so right up here we are in our Sunday suits and rebuild tragedy choose for is looking for the\n[noise]\nYes but we're looking [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this for ... well\nYou see the air shaft there they find that the air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this or get any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then they'll see how my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the blue shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this bitch does it end he yelled back up to Belgium get me out of your boom ... backup do\n\nEventually they'll gee found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when delta G founder so what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls ... yeah that play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids\nWere the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be\nRight so so in this situation the two girls are dead than there is no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired detectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's\nAnd and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if people are already dead than you do the the lawyers [noise]\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates\n... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you have yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fight as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of plant or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right because there are ... you're building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nOf course soon and I knew Mr hawk from bowling [noise] who's who's the de other daughter my daughter were in the same class and I knew him from church and\nWhen you have to be and then I'm On a few ... the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now with this [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise] we'll be right back [noise] [noise]\n\nHi this is worthy from Arlington, Texas radioactive supported

I'm I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab\nAnd now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right there was I knew this thing but it was a client was very guilty of something they had found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what's their next move well so they decide that pretty bird plea bargain\nThat take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to take it a little\nWell that's kinda gross oh yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank's perspective he's got this information\nSpelled G started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or money toughed it out but he suffered a no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or loosely well what else can I Do\nTo make a living he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the ... all over the stress and pressure\nTo choose to do\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually\nThe criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the state bar the Belgian our money\nDid was write what they did was good exactly\nAccording to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job [noise]\nUh I mean I was a good lawyer\nWas I thought so art everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case\nIt's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone\nWhat people think what if what if what if you will face\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham\nWhy don't you stand up um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely is because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story\nI always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on a phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nI'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm\nI'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nWho's been with the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing marching camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so it's sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew the law schools were teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that is maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received a policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just\nGetting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my\nMy father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli the lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to the ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband\nAnd causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are\nThey're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate some of that experience\nWell it's impossible to really communicate and words\nBut you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate more I made forty years later and skills\nI I get ... and it's a struggle to it because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't I guess\n\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of that that you would want people to know that you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree past my sleep I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where was it difficult for us and down\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had bad just that summer and he had a full scholarship Herbert any uh graduated just before and so to live and I'm sure the other two children get great future\nHad a true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nIt's it's so horrible you know to be in the president's shoes\nTo live [noise] I mean how do you really lose your your daughter you know\nWhat what are the ... for you to protecting the person to kill her\nNo justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nI don't expect him to accept it but that's the way it is\n\n\nUm I'm going to get to the minute of silence up here if that's okay you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Albany", "day": "29"}
