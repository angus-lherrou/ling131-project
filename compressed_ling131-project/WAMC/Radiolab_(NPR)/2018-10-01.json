Kennedy Airport of course will place wants to go get away from it all\nUp there with her producer Alan Horn we hadn't actually meant to come to a guy that we had been interviewing\nDaughter for a large it'd be portrayed by demeanor and the rest of your heart emotional right in the middle of the interview he'd gotten a call [noise] hello said he had to run or that's why they are really crap we have more questions will do so we decided to jump in the car with\nFriends men with guns\nIn the garage to look like they're in combat uniform for Iraq have automatic weapon\nIn case this Paul act man when he carries a a security expert and that's what he would be called nowadays and speaking of the reason he's here today at JFK Airport is to talk with Jet Blue security\nTeaching the few things about how they might do their jobs better okay we have fought over in a building\nThat fought over in a restaurant [noise]\nNot a general Bobby security kicks is how\nWe are really the terminal and the only place\nIt seems we're allowed to stand other right here on the concrete nearing two lanes of traffic accidents finally pulled out the thing he'd been hoping to show the folks that jet\nBlue has your or a little you're very stylish little laptop just starting up simple computer program that he promises about forty minutes\nTeach here into a person\nHas to start start start\nStepping forward to the computer hears loading image is either way the best way to reach the ...\nI see that one again that was so fast [noise] oh knew what\nHis happening I promise I'll tell you but let me just keep going\nTo explain Paul ... studies faces the human face he's probably studied the face more than anyone\nUp until my work that was person certainly hey\nWe didn't really know how many questions that they could make and there was nothing like a musical notation for the face\nSo about Thirty years ago he began by examining his own face very closely to see how many muscles are in there and there are roughly fifty then he spent the next couple of decades trying to figure out how many ways those muscles can combine to form a facial expression\nI developed tropical official action courting system basically a muscular scoring system you can apply to photograph film realized PA right you just did a a one to for\nYour your numbering my facial\nExpression the one to the most common fingers were just raising your eyebrows are just weren't too far as just raising the upper arm it says in this country and we're\nAll in all the human face is capable of three thousand different expressions that's what he thinks it's\nSeven is concerned are all in all the human face is capable of three thousand different expressions that's what he thinks and as we sat in his publishers office in midtown Manhattan is about an hour before the airport incident run example yeah he demonstrated if you\nAre very few fabricate anger very unlikely you'll put in what we call the anger reliable muscle which most people can't voluntarily movie\nAnger reliable ... I Want to see her as\nYour ten senior I'm touching their red margin of our lives are we just looked you looked fierce when you do that instantly so if you're in someone's mad look at their lips

joins while that skin moose lightly down\nHard to to to buy visible you know what\nYou just didn't when you said that anyway the reason that we're talking about him here an hour on lying is because with all the attention\nThat's being paid these days to finding life by using fancy brain scanners X. men is kind of on a crusade to remind us that you don't have to do that you don't have to look in the brain because the brain is actually directly connected to the face in ways that we can't control\nAll of these muscles are activated involuntarily when an emotion and curves without your choice\nOr the things happening on my face on her face on any face but you know we don't even know I also amount of my garden for naked face [laughter]\nWhich brings me to my new favorite word leakage leakage leakage yes it is a word you will hear again and again when you talk to anyone in the field of like catching take for example burying mammoth area el McManus em CNN us longtime CIA interrogator\nPhysiological leakage could be anywhere from sweat gland activity when someone knows that they are misleading you and they break out in a sweat\nThat because of ... nervous system that you have no control over basically telling the truth is easy that is the crux of courting Steve Silverman a reporter for wired magazine the truth is kind of sitting there in your brain your brain knows it you say it no problem but your brain has to work harder to generate the line there is an effort\nAnd with that there is always leakage even in an instantaneous moments sometimes you even hear it were a person's breathing pattern will change or the size that people do and what particular time did they do a you're not trained to look at it most people ignore it but if you've been trained and you know what to look for ... minutes it it will strike you right in the face\nSpeaking faces really talking about a particular brand ... specializes in had to do with something that he called micro\nFacial expression or very fast ... expression about twenty fifth with a second\nOkay just to just as an example let's just let us imagine that you're smiling\nGames but on the inside of us to know you can attest maybe you got some rage a little little being all that but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is went for the tiny tiny moment a little bit of that in a rage slips out onto your face\nAnd then what happened\nWell I don't remember when it turns at some point she started to have a lot of problems small crises started to come up a whole series of things they were me problems insurance problems\nYou know I've got a situation where I Need to move out of place from currently living as it was because my roommates you know crazy\nHe's felt temp felt sort of pulling back yes yes until one evening he gets a call from her and she's totally panicked\nOr do you have to come over we have something we really need to talk about him at this point I have no idea what it is now at this time [noise] but ah\nShe said hey I'm pregnant [noise]\nI think I'm pregnant\nWell what did you do well he basically stood up and do the right thing\nThere really was a part of me that we're thinking well here's the test of a person\nWho is going to stand by her and support her through the pregnancy and he said okay let's go to the doctor together\nI Would say where when I Want to be there and she would say three o'clock at the doctor's office than I Would say okay and I would go be the early you know to forty five\nAnd uh she would not be there three Fifteen would roll around at three thirty would roll around there I Am sitting sort of alone in the perception is ... ... can I help you\nShe would say oh well that that one was at one o'clock where I Would notice on the sign in sheet that she had actually signed it and I could see the handwriting and we're talking dated was hopes and um she signed it two hours earlier\nYeah so yeah yeah and as this\nFolks and um she signed it two hours earlier\nYeah so yeah yeah and as discontinued I Would say repeat that for me three okay so three o'clock I mean these are moments in principle clarity of life you're not losing track of stuff\nThen he gets a call from a woman named Leslie\nI met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture she showed up with just all of her stuff in trash bags and then she disappeared\nLeaving the back behind so it was right around that point where it check bounced and I was like oh now and so through mutual friends she tracked down shoot I was kind of like OK well she has this boyfriend she called them called them and sort of wanted like is he in on this she had no idea what she's talking about no he didn't even know she had a roommate me flatly\nI mean who the hell was who are you know who were you you will mean money annoyed Joan and she you know it was all very confusing\nNot knowing what else to do Leslie decide to go into hopes room and start looking through her style I just thought you know I'm just going to go through this see what's in here and that's when I found those no books\nAre about a new book an inside literally pages upon pages of different names with different social next to them\nCredit card numbers mother's maiden name birthday page after page of that kind of information on what exactly was that these are like crib notes for con woman that's when I called Jude and I said get over here what did you do at this point well Jude knew he had to do something\nAnd I finally got up the courage\nTo confront hope and say\nThis was over\nMy own responsibilities you're not withstanding to be um\nYou know the pregnancy and what about Leslie at this point when she\nWell luckily wondered how many people in that notebook hoping that through Craig's list which is lovely but her so she went back to ... and started posting warning\nMany times a day think single white female statistic I mean the Gray Thursday meal they twenty something got close by to blue eyed blonde right away run away in fact when your hairdresser she's hosting morning after warning if you have any information about the person is simply want from that day please email at ... I Hope at Yahoo dot com\nAnd took them all down as in Craig's on Craig's list ... remark soldier frog so he thought that they were inappropriate they were unfairly the right thing that everyone has rights she would pose no drama and not even take down\nShe would pose a fact of the matter is that hope is out there somewhere he would take it down but within a few days in those moments where Craig within the bathroom away from his death [noise]\nPeople respond to stories and you get multiple reports and she wrote people off\nEvery different kind of person from all over the place yoga instructors landlords car mechanics fact flower shop owners boss\nVeterinarian car rental agency cashing place if the dollar\nNot functionally ten thousand dollars and everybody was the same story one\nFor among seems to be moving with tons of stuff on the part of the task to check out of a closed countenance boat when it comes over the\nCourse of several years there were posting on her and there were people who were trying to find stuff\nShe got kind of a celebrity\nFollowing by the way we used to get emails like every day for people who were just like is there any news today loves the nose put you tell us anything I'm like no she's in hiding sorry\nWho was this woman and can I get you to introduce\nYourself to save you are and what you do my name is Terri Larry on the special agent with the Louisiana department of justice\nLouisiana how do we get Louisiana well after a few years hope resurfaced in New Orleans\nHad a cold and complained to from a lady down in the New Orleans area to her credit card had been used\nHope pre surfaced in New Orleans\nWe had a call and complaints from a lady down in the New Orleans area or her credit card had been used someone had tried to purchase Dell computers and it just started from there every time we talked to one victim lead to one or two other bit of hope has a almost like a cult following you know hurry ammo was that\nShe knew she got to know him really well\nI talked a lot of victims and they just don't trust people anymore a lot of these people did some good human open heart things with her and said this to pour girl I've got to help her out\nAnd there were there really let down there just don't trust people anymore and let's say you know not only do you have to worry about cleaning up your credit than getting your money back from the your bags you know you've got to deal with with people in the surf now that you don't know you know who you're standing next to\nDavid had that feeling\nOne of the houses that help at Blount tree in San Francisco he had found something that was really upsetting\nI had come across a letter that she had written to my parents would never mailed just sings and very very terrible things\nBut ... says we're totally untrue\nIn this letter to his parents\nAt at one point during\nPregnancy she was having complications and the the main symptom was like severe ... bleeding and bad news is that she was on somebody's living room or at a minor hers in this terrible condition and that um that I had that I just left\nTotally abandoning the situation in my responsibility is just a graphic and ugly depiction of an awful scene [noise]\n\nJesus traumatize\nThe whole experience he compared to an earthquake [laughter]\nHave you back then that's great you know never well one of the things that happens is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and there for a little while after the earthquake you're not sure\nThat when you put your foot down the ground is still going to be in the same place so that was a minute ago there were days\nI can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say anything of any consequence there was just\nI have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires in September seventies and that was true\nBut it didn't say the Denver nineteenth or September fifteenth September Seventeen\nTo other people crying on the phone talking to me about this situation and they were victims six seven years ago people are embarrassed they're embarrassed and then they become mad\nYou know and that's when they become detect it\nAllowed me perhaps\nWhere are you know front of her mother's house in a bad\nNeighborhood in New Orleans of around midnight what's your name and her mom Marcia Valentine and why are you there exactly I kind of gotten a little obsessed with how you kind of stuff\nNo idea [laughter] I like the having technical\nThere was something about imagining\nHow she was doing this so it was like really fun to imagine but maybe also happens Leslie to it like once I started looking I was able to find a lot of victims a lot of information and I wanted to meet her [noise]\nMarcia Valentine\nAround for around here that are looking like they have what you mean every before where I'm at [noise] I'll come back there\nThey're not around here\n... ... ... ... [noise]\nI'll come back later okay next right we hold up but what did you know about hope at this point well I knew she had had a daughter\nReally know anybody\nYou know not choose the timing was all wrong\nAnd I had located the father well I'm standing outside of hooks mother's house stairs through clockwork track piled up against the ...\nI don't see anyone inside the house\nNext morning I went out to find a woman a ruby\nRuby moon I live in New Orleans Louisiana revealed the coffee shop I live down the street from hopes mother the one who came to New Orleans um her mother you know\nIntroduced us really has a kid who's about the same age hopes daughter and they go to Montessori together and when Rubio opened her shop a year ago\nHope to car pool today she would\nPick them up and when we got home about five thirty six o'clock we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes and quite frankly I enjoyed\nIt's ridiculous I mean her idea was that lives would be over represented at a temp agencies\nYou can probably imagine you know people who need to go to the temp agency are\nUsually people who cannot remain one job for very long period of time\nThat's not true of all people who work at a temp agencies most of them are just fine but some of them she figured keep ending up as a temp agency because they just have this\nProblem with their you know their lifestyle the truth ... are let's keep going I Want to hear how this comes out to make it\nSo yelling in her crew went to a couple of temp agencies in the LA area I interviewed a hundred and eight people that's them all kinds of questions not just about their employment history but about their past\nTheir childhood history about their families very personal information you checked their answers to those questions against their family and friends against their court records just to see if she could find people who story and you know inconsistencies big ones and then the hundred and eight books that she ... she found a pathological liar\nTwelve actually twelve twelve out of a hundred and they'd say abortion or they've pathological Arizona depends on how you define I Would hope that she found twelve people that you wanted to look at further she said to them\nWould you be willing to come on a purely voluntary basis into the lab\nAnd uh let me scan your brain [laughter]\nJust another day you're going to involve\nIs basically put people in the scanner and then we scan their bang\nChicken everyone's ... all one hundred and eight or participants the liar than the non liars no one knew which group there and ... and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just beyond therefore it\nCalled the prefrontal cortex and this is the part that the brand that part of the nation is where the real thinking up making decisions and more judgment for example\nYou know if you do me into that place just behind your forehead [noise]\nYou'll see two kinds of brain tissue you've got gray\nMatter and then you've got white men I've heard of gray matter yes well we think of the brands being gray but actually to to think gray and white the great stuff kind of things like the computer processor part they're these little clumps of neurons that process information\n[noise] computer [noise]\nThat's the great where's the white white matter it's like the the connection between all these cars on the computer the way met her in other words is what moves the thoughts around gray is where the\nHappened and why is when you move the thought from here\nTo there exactly yes\nThey transfer information from one end to the\nKids have got your grave white what y'all lean thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people who ... I\nFound out we would see a reduction\nSome piece of it not they're missing something physically she thought she would find less gray stuff less of the thinking so why would why would\nWhy because that's what she's seen in other um mental disorders are kind of like this and if you think about it in a really simplistic level the graves where you think your thoughts and it's also among other things where you crunch your moral calculations and liars she figured have trouble in this department some maybe they have ...\nThat was okay but when she got the pictures that what you saw was\nSuch a great increase in [noise]\nAnd not the great more white matter [noise]\nWhite stuff a lot more twenty five percent a quarter\nTo ... they have twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes\nBefore we get to what that means what were you thinking when you saw this\nI was really bubbling [laughter]\nI thought this was this was something something something\nSomething shoe here's your idea so far ready if she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role\nI think something should here's her idea so far ready if she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in a kind of in the moments storytelling that's essentially what lying is coming up with a story on the fly let me give you an example kept mhm you're leaving work you're ...\nAnd joining but nice co worker corners you hey Sallie corners you in the elevator\nHey asks you out on you know I Need to ask you maybe want to go out with me on friday\nSo there you are questions dangling in the air it's more so for most of us right at that moment inside her head and our brains were thinking [noise]\nHow shall I say you're busy saying and indeed one from my point when he was I think I think they would reach out into the void trying to form a connection with some ideas that can help you come up with some excuse I can say I'm like well shoot\nAnd really what you need to do at this moment is you take a bunch of disparate thoughts on different sides of your brain like 'em me tonight teeth dentist and connect them altogether\nOver flick that book okay we can all do it given enough time but for the pathological liar she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to begin with they get\nTheir factor at night and you do you think of wanting to start writing glide path and yoga I have to filter I thought he loves it the more connection very beekeeping that factored the speed of the processing skins jump from one idea to another and you can come up with more um random stories\nShe thinks the brains of most of us we have trouble making those connections we have would you have trouble as I said do you like do you want to come out with you know friday night would you not be able to come up with a ...\nI Would say um yeah I Am\nI have to ... straws to assert searching district county we always we have about three hundred and sixteenth stress over and uh I'm only I'm only doing ones with with um with little red circles on them so that's there's you know sorry\n[laughter] I don't know I did this happen there you go see you've got you've got extra white men are prone\nTo she's saying this is a cause of lying or an effective line like well she's\nNot sure and this is a big debate in which he can say is that children as they grow from eight to eight ten there is a big jump in the white\nMatter oh and that's actually the same age that they give up the skill to lie\nAmong the\nClothes ... given everything we've just talked about how do you square this\nInformation with being a new mom I mean is this your first good yes it's my first one a boy or girl a girl what's her name ... doesn't it make you wonder a little bit about Zoe and what's what's going on inside her head\nOh yes I Wonder about that all of the times it's still too early to scan her brain but eventually I Will do it are you serious yeah\nThis is a moral to this never if you were a little baby have a social psychologist as a mother who to the very very dangerous thing anyway if she does is maybe a little bit more about the nature nurture of liars but until then\nThis is radio
