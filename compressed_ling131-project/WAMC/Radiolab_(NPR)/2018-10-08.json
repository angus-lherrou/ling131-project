I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nThey're gonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before then said something\nHi [laughter] okay I think it's a good thing\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning you start getting what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nWhen that became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do is be killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire near right Jason Harris than double John become sort of a national story\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu ... each year\nHow knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire and they arrive Jason Harris than double John and will become sort of a national story\nI personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in the police\nDepartment it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented burned\nSo burst study had Florida is the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records laws and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... invent sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nI think three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any\nPaper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work how many police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that involve probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nAnd then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of Bush of that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many documents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages\nI have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall\nWe've got um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B bay county\nBook or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through\nThe alphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nCombination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent a eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer or officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nFor every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was chase [noise]\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer or officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will often link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national ... agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it\nYou know kind of surprised us well the\nBiggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers showed that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic\nLevel are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon so it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's\nConsidered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs that you see\nOnce or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between fake ... for their same demographics and his without they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far\nIt's up to lose somebody that cancer of lost a friend that cancer recently in fact\nThere's a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer\nHad never been charged ... so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right Senate if I'm\nTo get into cars to brown\nThan something happened in you know here in Florida\nIn the clubs and\nSo after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or you know I just wanted to know the ones and has been telling everyone about then\nThere's the energy to her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping ... right right we all just simply trying to find our way is a personal gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at certain point because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says the age comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to crystal [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu shut down\nYou know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to crystal [noise]\n\nMidsize one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nThere was some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing that I'm getting motel rooms again this is talk of the Clintons we start to stay over eight inches of houses\nWe see each other bad on the couch you know a air mattress it's it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the policy for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some are the shows with a with like therapy for\nVictims let me ask but there was this moment when it's spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add I'm Marlon problems to\nAnd it was when crystal let some of its over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlene was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through the patchy grad so we usually the video that\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables I says to the garden was here in\nIn that that I Am then cause a when a when you know when they took him away in released and sit down and say we came back here it's all you can now what's going on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association Michael went unpaid onions you get that smell like it just you get slapped mhm and your\nAny brings you right back here mhm\nYep in the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\nSometimes for sort of you to read some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\nThen you don't want me to a Texan my find the best what about appalling to me\nOf women handed me the phone\n\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu [noise]\nThen you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find a lot of what about let me\nA couple of women handed me the phone my\n\nIt was probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a\nThree to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing\nI Know yeah we haven't been I have\nIt was a very fine we saw that last week\nAnd I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\n\nLives at home I have to go there all the time of course\nYeah that was for how could you not\nThen I Know what you want to go take a chair\nAnd sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man we share everything like that like he literally I think he does he liked to have lunch every day\nI mean I Love the way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that always did not do\nYou take his chair I get home\nI never [noise]\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise] or you\nCan either repeal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one year ago\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ...\nAnd it was around this time of the few these women started to call themselves the mothers movement [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC\n[noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time\nThing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group had suddenly become\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu [noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThe thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group had suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them\nSo stay with us [noise]\nCause for a guy who's running around with a knife tried to stab people it was off his meds if he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly\nThey park neighborhood street and you can see down the street half a block away\nFrom this shirtless black guy and you show up there\nThat's the kind of talking on the cop were in the body can and this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand and he's walking towards the ... once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the cop when the body can pulled out the taste of the other officers out it was added a free is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching approaching approaching approaching\nMe get within like ten feet of the cops and then [noise]\nThe guy was a buddy empires dictator the guy holding the night he falls onto his back onto the cement driveway still got the knife in his hand hey\nHey you're going to\nEnd the cop who's got a gun out he hustles over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me do\nReal lucky you didn't just shut your best shot you want to die if you want to die [laughter] you can't guy\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nMe [laughter] you know kind of counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans unicorn judge that when I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away to use verbal commands first warn\nThem let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nIt's important because there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun so you know he's deployment\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThe deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... and it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife and at the end when there's no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name wasn't faceless and I got scared and I shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of or a poor that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finish watching the video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood if you want to miss it on the front steps waves of hatred what are you doing man ... does your stupid son of a bitch you and how close you tend to be in that wouldn't be back with us medication he wasn't doing drugs and he was as ... as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\n... primary election among the winner states ... has now ... county sheriff would was elected sheriff of\nLinn county [noise] friendly\nWhich the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition and police chiefs and it twenty six team ... put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out this principle two of the biggest pleasing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have I have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like
