dot com\nWho are backed by corporate pacts and special interest and therefore compromise they no longer prioritizing working families and they use the language of divisiveness and partisanship to distract us away from reality so what do we need\nI think we need some new voices I think we can stop with the career politicians in the lobby is I think it's important that we have folks who care about people who understand the value of opportunity you understand the value of a public education who have a diverse set of experiences and have not made a career\nOr exploiting fear and anxiety but actually care about progress for everybody\nNo matter what race or class your gender\nI can do that work I grew up here in Schenectady working class family went under Colgate earned a Rhodes Scholarship got my lord we met my wife who grew up in the stock just an hour away\nSpent time in the music space they must litigator in the commercial space diverse district experiences I've come across all folks of life and I'm excited to do that work now in D.C thank you\nInvest it\nWill good afternoon everyone I'm I'm Congressman John fast so and I ask for your support two weeks from tomorrow on election day I'm running on my record and my thirty four five years of service of living and working raising a family here in the nineteenth congressional district\nThese are partisan polarized times in America and what I've done since I took office or in January of two thousand Seventeen I've worked consciously to work across party lines to get things done\nIn fact I'm proud to say that I rank Eighteenth out of four hundred and thirty five members of Congress in terms of being most bipartisan\nAnd what does that mean it means that I was able to lead a legislative effort to combat one of the most important problems that we face not only here in upstate New York but across America the crisis of opioid addiction\nMy legislation to stop act is incorporated in a major piece of opioids and and uh legislation that will be signed into law this week by President Trump\nThat legislation I had two hundred and Seventy five Democrat and Republican co sponsors that legislation will stem the flow of illegal ... substances like fat no shift into our country through the u._s. mail from places like China\nI've also worked hard for a dairy farmers in this district we've achieved improvements in payments to dairy farmers who are suffering under a long sustained a economic pressure\nWe've also worked with the Trump Administration to change the ... story terrorists than discriminatory tariffs against our agricultural products\nSo there are many issues we can discuss\nAnd I'm proud of the fact that we are now growing the economy to over four percent we have more job openings in America than we have unemployed people and I'm going to continue lift honored with the opportunity to serve again I'm going to continue my bipartisan efforts to move our country and our district forward thank you so much\nEven Greenfield\nThanks very much uh my name is Steve Greenfield up from New policy New Yorker living there for almost Eighteen years um and I have previously served two terms on the new pulse school district a board of education I have been serving for almost Fifteen Years in the new policy volunteer fire department\nOr where else who represent them at the ... county volunteer fire association in a legislative action capacity\nAnd uh let me tell you a little bit about why I decided to run for this race even though it's not traditionally expected that somebody\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nIs the one I saw the platforms of the major party candidates that were running and the words war and peace and poverty did not appear anywhere on any of those platforms and still do not appear even right here on this podium today that we're talking about middle class people working people we have forty four million Americans in this country living below the poverty line\nAnother fifty million living just added and nobody is speaking to them or nobody is speaking to the question of wages which have not grown relative to inflation in the last forty years and contract into one third of the part of GDP that they were forty years ago [noise]\nUh I majored in economics in college I think we have enough corporate lawyers in Congress and an all the halls of government today and I think\nPeople claim to vote on their pocketbook issues and if that's really the case then maybe voted for someone who's training is in economics is the way to go for at least one seat in Congress or this year\nWe're not being serious about pretending we care about lowering taxes if we're not lowering the one point five trillion dollars we're spending a fighting wars we're not serious about lowering crime and drug abuse and improving education\nUnless we're lowering the rate of poverty because the cost of not lowering them as much more expensive than the course of course\nA cost of addressing them ah I also want to talk about climate change because both parties are science deniers when it comes to the timeline that we have available to act\nA and most importantly I'm kind of\nHard hard to believe that people come here to talk about people getting too much corporate money when they're here themselves about seven billion dollars of corporate money so let's be serious about these things\nDie and Neal thank you guys so much for inviting me I really appreciate it really um unlike Antonio and John and even even Steve I'm I'm not a polished politician I Am not a lobbyist I Am not a lawyer\nI was not created by committee in some a dark room in DC by power brokers\nReally all I Am as a resident of New York Nineteen\nI'm your friend I'm your neighbor and I wanted to run because I thought how desperately we needed an advocate\n\nThe big corporations the big parties the big money all of those people they have a lot of advocates in DC they a lot of people fighting for them\nWe we don't and a lot of people are suffering because of it and the thing about New York Nineteen is friendly unique we saw the fission resilient\nWere independent minded people even her biggest voting bloc they're unaffiliated voters because that's who we are we don't buy into all this divisive stuff we decide who's backed and that's who we vote for\nWe don't like a division I don't like any of it the hysteria it doesn't help anything and it doesn't help I\nAnd in his life of a wide variety of experiences I have learned that everyone believes what they do for a reason into them it is a very important\nBut when we're fighting among each other and ourselves we can never figure out without raising it to work on a solution but that's not a problem that we have we're OK speaking to each other lifting to each other talking to each other\nIf you live in New York state Fifteen to twenty percent of your property taxes right now is going to public employee health insurance on the private market and both of their plans would continue that and drive there continue to drive their costs up and challenge the two percent tax cap enforce the firing of teachers um\nIt would you if you're if you're a producer twenty percent of your product costs is made up by your health care costs for your employees\nAnd that's why our products are not competitive on the global market anymore the world has moved on we need to ensure everybody we need to ensure the minute affordable cost for businesses and our property tax payers alike and we need to get started on that right away no more delays single payer Medicare for all\nThe same question Daniel\nThanks for asking there are a lot of false things that go around when it comes to like single payer universal health care or you know Medicaid for all\nAnd there's one basic thing that you can say and it's really easy to say when you're not taking money for any of his company basically health care should not be a for profit industry in many ways it does not make sense and people that profit off of illness and that should not be involved in the decision making profits as to whether or not we have health care it doesn't make any sense\nI'm not a big fan of Medicare for all although it's more efficient than most private health care insurance has [noise]\nBut [noise] there's a way that we can do that then again this is going to take people that aren't pot there are paid for that can just tell the truth they can sell it in a truthful late to both sides\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\n... so small businesses right\nThey have so much trouble providing health care costs so much money they limit the amount of employees they have right they don't have to go over that threshold you make sure that we can provide that\nThey can expand their businesses people's hours are being held at a lower amount so they can't get those benefits they have more discretionary income or spending they can pump back into the community and we're spending all this money on it any way we subsidize everyone that works at Wal Mart's healthcare we sometimes almost everyone's health care we streamline that we take out the people that are profiting from us being ill\nIt's a system that feels to both conservative fiscally and an appeal to people on a more level where and when we both agree on it that's the only way we're going to get it done\nTime thank you Richard oh God Oh yes I like to point out how profoundly dishonest a congressman fives those\nUh characterization of my health care physician is and it's been pretty much laid bare by the fact that we have individuals on the stage you've made it clear\nSpeaks a lot about how one is not we'll just have a true debate on what I had been advocating now for for over a year and a half on a very consistent basis\nOr we don't have time for games here or we don't have time for misleading people people are dying and they want answers and they want answers now\nAnd I want you pass a public option now I Want to make sure that we are no longer the only developed country in the world without some form of universal healthcare a public option will do that it'll drive down premiums they don't drive down the ... it'll free up the cost for small business owners have to apply employer business employer based insurance and it'll also free up\nEmployees who often times people trapped\nOr where they work because of a fear that they might lose a kid that they want or there's currently receiving do other pieces to drive down costs I think it's absolutely critical was to make sure that Medicare has negotiating power with big pharma again keep in mind congressman ... never owners these words\nHe never said Medicare should have negotiating power with the farm and yet we all know that would go a long way\nAnd cutting down on these costs why not is it because he takes thousands and thousands of dollars a quarter pac money from big pharma I submit you\nYes we can't have the games here we can't mislead about our respective positions I've been clear my position for very long time let's just have a real debate on the facts\nRight now I'm going to address ... Greenfield with his third question your platform includes cutting one point five trillion dollars in military spending unquote avoiding international hostilities how would you practically accomplish either of these concepts elected\nOkay first of all I'm not proposing cutting one point five trillion I've explained that one point five trillion is the actual size of our current military budget and it's really important that we acknowledge that because of our discussion about military spending is drastically skewed by the seven hundred billion dollar figure that people toss out\nBut that figure is only the Pentagon budget and does not include that our nuclear arsenal was under the department of energy our international weapons transfers programs are in the department of states\nAre and that the legacy costs of operating a two hundred billion dollars a year and the Veterans Administration and that the entire homeland security party a a a homeland security department as part of the defense budget\nSo we have a budget of one point five trillion dollars okay the majority of that budget is is a capital budget and exist because of\nYou know the bases we have and about eighty countries and the active war operations that we have going on in the three major theaters in about a dozen more minor theaters so the first thing that I Would do to bring that under control is to just stop starting\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nOur military budget is more than the next eight largest military budgets combined and six of those countries are our closest allies\nMilitary spending is the most inflationary form of spending and a government can can can enact other than simply printing money and had to get out to people and that in turn a forces us to use a um inflationary suppressing interest rates and things like that so yeah we're going to stop start in wars and\nA question do you favor more or less military spending over our current defense budget\nFor the interesting thing about military spending as it can be done in in a bunch of different ways obviously we need to be the care we need to be safe but there are a lot of things in our military spending that don't make any sense either so we have hyper expensive\nExpensive obsolete equipment things that take tens of billions of dollars to make over so long by the time they're actually in production we don't need them anymore\nAnd then we're doing things that aren't important like a lot of our servicemen and women many of which I'm related to don't even have the equipment they need or or the kind of best protection and a half to death by themselves which is also ridiculous\nSo I'm One of the things are there lots of different ways we can pay for that the largest employer on planet earth on the entire planet earth is the U.S department of defense I think the biggest employer planet earth\nAnd so one of the things that I've been thinking about doing for a long time it's a version of selective service it's civil education and employment where kids are from like Nineteen twenty three they can give back\nTo their communities and they can do it in a bunch of different ways they can do AmeriCorps they can Peace Corps meals on wheels which is a program that was a visceral rated by Trump recently or they can go into the military the police force\nThem which is the amount of extra bodies ever going to have who get the chance and its opportunity to travel around things were going to have a lot more investments in war is because everyone's going to be connected to someone that is actually going to go over there fighting and I can tell you that someone has to deal with that it's terrifying Everytime you watch the news [noise]\nSo we get that money back that's another way we can get some of the money back from the budget without actually cutting our efficiency in any sort of way\nAnd then at the same question to Antonio Delgado on military spending cutting are increasing\nYeah I think we've certainly um be gone a trend in the wrong direction on this tours are emphasizing militarization at the expense of actually making sure we allocate our resources to prop up our state department and make sure we do things more from a diplomatic perspective I mean we're spending probably what less than one percent right now\nI'm actually making sure that our diplomats are properly uh supported and do the work in a very\nA toxic world that we're living in a study came out a couple of years ago Pentagon study\nThat showed that I'm a hundred and twenty five billion dollars that's how much a bureaucratic waste that is right now in the department of defense a hundred and twenty five billion or there was almost a quarter of the budget and so the fact that we have a waste of that magnitude that is more than how much money we spend the department of education\nThat that's how much waste we have right now so it isn't important be militarily ready no doubt about it it's a dangerous world we live in\nBut at the same time we should be a lot smarter about how we focus on our money and the way we spend that money our futures conflicts not pass oriented conflicts we're still putting money in outdated modes of defense or we have cyber security issues to be thoughtful about we have\nThe fact that we're being attacked by Russia a you know being hacked into our systems what are we doing to actually make sure that our protection is no defense systems are modernized for this purpose and ultimately our strength is in our values and we got to keep in mind is not in our military\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nThe military spending budget um has been under a sequester over the last eight years and that's the question has greatly hollowed out our readiness\nFact just last year we lost eighty three service members in training accidents that is on heard of we lost about twenty three\nIn military engagements the notion that our planes can fly forty percent of our planes cannot fly because of lack of spare parts that the after action report of the tragic naval accidents in the Pacific waters near Japan\nShowed that our sailors were not getting enough rest but that our ships were not important enough for repair and refunding and that we simply have hollowed out much many aspects of our military now there's no doubt\nThe solutions to the problems we face don't involve higher\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nThat would save three hundred and fifty to five hundred and fifty dollars per year for each homeowner in our district would say businesses enormous amount of money two hundred and twenty million dollars in our district alone he's against it he just doesn't understand what the problems are in upstate New York why people keep believing\nDo Greenfield same question do you believe Mr Dole got those rap lyrics are relevant to today's election\nNo I Do not and I really wish that this question we're more about whether both of their careers is corporate lawyers were relevant to this election because I think that's really what we need to be talking about because that's what the each of them would bring to the halls of Congress if they get elected\nI've been a musician all my life and I guess I'm considered non threatening enough as electoral forcing here that nobody's going back to examine\nMy recordings nor do I think there would be any purpose\nFor doing that but I invite everybody to go do that because it might actually help my career if that's what we're going to be bringing into the political arena um you know I I when I mentioned to my union officers I'm a junior officer myself when I mentioned to sort of higher ups in my union that one of my opponents worked for ah for akin Gump in New York they cast\nYou know they asked about the implications of that for for labor union people\nAnd I think that's the kind of question we need to be asking Antonio Delgado about I think we need to be asking Congress been ... about the corporations that he lobbied for during his lobbying career\nBut most of all what's troubling me is this mail I get every day that I Can't believe in mail my mailbox that shows blue eyed and blond women clutching their blonde children in dread fear of a black man who's come to their community [noise]\nScholar a Harvard lawyer and every day my mailbox is filled with things that my teenage daughters have to see about a scary black man who's a threat\nTo blond women and I am and since that my children had to be exposed to this and I actually asked congressman ... to renounce these advertisements right here and right now I [noise]\n\nCaution members of the audience a about this you\nGive us your word at the beginning that it would be at the beginning and the and\nThat's where it should stop please\nNielsen question I don't have any problem with like ... I mean the truth is everybody on the planet wants to be a musician here's Lee everybody everyone every actor wants to be a rock star who wants to be something and you work in the genre in which you are using that your medium that you're All right so if Antonio with the country singer\nThere'd be a lot of pickup trucks and broken heart that's the difference right so\nYou can't penalize them or that especially as other someone else that worked in the creative industry hum\nAnd anytime soon and ... as he was saying earlier to add to your experience as a human being I mean all of the things out of your qualifications to make it more well rounded person I think of all the things that people go after him before I'm On the board of these giant things I'm On the board of water keeper for many years and the board of the urban our partnership or fried education\nFor one point two million city school kids you all these different things that are paid Center for human rights\nThose are still more positive but they add to your experience as a human and I agree with the the other thing that is always very bothersome to me is that people think that you need to be a lawyer to be in Congress that somehow you can only legislative your actual or that's not true at all all you needed experience smart and you have to be literate because you need to read information you can make good decisions for the people\nAnd I'm really not okay with that more lobbyist lawyers being in Congress we have enough\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nBefore we go and I want to reward or both or Antonio ... and John fast so an extra thirty seconds in rebuttal to what's going on here as far\nWell let me listen I I I'm the only thing I Would add I'm blessed and said ah\nThere's nothing in my music and I want to be clear about this um was denigrating to women or nothing in my music was denigrating to law enforcement and I can promise you nothing in my music when the anti American\nUm and I think it's unfortunate that uh individual have decided to drip lyrics out of their proper context to feed into divisiveness and hate a clear a that is my view those are my lyrics in terms of uplift ... an empowerment um and I am always going to be standing on what I Believe in\nKilling testing well let me be clear as well are those are not my advertisements those are done independently I have no control legally or otherwise over those advertisements and let me also say this\nI Would reject the vote of any person who would vote for me because they don't like Mr Delgado is race or any other reason\nLess vote on the issues and that's really where I stand and uh I just think that at the end of the day or if we want to talk about just store it meant an ad that are distorting look at what Nancy Pelosi and Mr Delgado are putting up against me\nThis question goes to John fast so during the debate over Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination you felt that Dr Christine and Christine Blasey Ford head credibility but you also said the allegation she may uncorroborated\nAnd quote apps and country proved that they should be no doubt unquote the capital or should be confirmed Senate Democrats however who read the FBI report before the final vote that it was anything but a comprehensive investigation do you stand by your public support for now Supreme Court justice vet Kavanaugh and if so why\nI I Do stand by my support for now justice Kavanaugh and I think that Senate Democrats or did not have a clean hands in this process they had the anonymous letter that came from Dr Ford\nFor six or seven weeks before they did anything with it um and then they leaked it\nAnd news media sources showed up in her classroom and that's how her identity became known a that was reprehensible to me the fact of the matter in this regard is that these were allegations from thirty six years ago and any allegations like this should be taken seriously and they should be reviewed and looked at and that's exactly what was done\nAnd what the Democrats did\nWas they turned our concepts of justice on their head\nWe're not in this country guilty until proven innocent\nWe're not in this country in the business of a condemning someone in convicting someone without corroboration without real evidence\nAnd we're not in this country or abandoning all of our concepts of fairness and rule of law and that's exactly what they did they try to destroy the character and the reputation in a political assassination of justice cabinet and it was very apparent when you when you watched it\nA Senator Feinstein Senator Schumer should be the ones to take the heat on this issue not Dr Ford not justice Kavanaugh and not anyone else they manipulated the process they abuse and undermine the rule of law and unfortunately they undermine confidence in our courts and I think it was an outrage and it remains and outrage in my mind\nSame subject Steve Greenfield\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nAnd I have to bring fall to both of the major parties for what happens\nFirst of all it's important to remember that the allegations that Senator Feinstein had in her portfolio she had for many many months and she waited until the very last second to present them\nAnd the reason for that was that she wasn't simply trying to scuttle the Kavanaugh nomination she was trying to scuttle it at a time when there wouldn't be time for President Trump's denominator replacement while the Kurds said it was still sitting in an office and so she was not acting primarily out of concern for women\nBut in but primarily out of concern for blocking a nomination until after January and I think that was reprehensible because people are playing to their teams instead of playing to the interests of the American people not to the women that might have been victimized and will continue to be victimized because of what happened during these confirmation hearings but more importantly\nIt will always be very challenging to prove something that happens thirty six years ago especially when only the people in the room where the witnesses\nAre much more concerned that the vote went ahead and approve justice Kavanaugh when you've repeatedly lied under oath right now this month on television in the hearing room about things that he had written and and was directly lying about his past and his vocabulary\nUnder oath that should've been an immediate this qualifier and I believe for the first time in history we have a proven\nA perjure under oath now sitting and the highest court of the land I sure wish the more the conversation at focused on that\nThank you Diane nailed I had a lot more concerned than you know originally came out like his dad you know the FBI they do background checks and the vet people because the things that they look for like drug addiction and dad and gambling that and a fair things like that so people can be bought and paid for especially someone who is a lifetime appointment to the court\nSo you know my greatest concern before any of this came out was that you know for a couple of baseball tickets right he was going to go like yeah you want me to vote I mean that's an exaggeration but still [noise]\nAs far as the hearing\nI Am I was absolutely shamed by both parties and how they behave it was an absolute cost or you know poor Dr ... for for worst nightmare came to exactly what she protected was going to come through came true and at the same time and you know the and the Democrats just let it happen and the Republicans just\nInstead of letting things work out in a natural way it became just a display a science show it was a way for the increase faction led them to
