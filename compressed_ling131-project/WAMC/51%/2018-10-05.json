they've been told that those are not part of the political domain and that those are not strategic those won't help them I'm so often women\n[noise] um and that struck me as very interesting because traditionally what we\nWe see is that women downplay their feminine attributes because they've been told that those are not part of the political domain and that those are not strategic those won't help them\nI'm so often women are told that they should up play their stereotypically masculine attributes that they should act more like men do um and then that's how they're successful but I think because of the me too movement because of the the surgeon women running\nUm that there is more comfort around this idea that women can run as themselves a that they can acknowledge that they have both stereotypically masculine an stereotypically feminine trait\nThat all of those are important in politics um and then they can hopefully be sort of rewriting of this narrative that women should run as men that men can run however they want\nThere's a lot to be seen because\nI'm the data we have on this the research we have on this\nIs from previous years where there's not as many women candidates and and traditionally women have not always um\nHow much success depending on the kind of level of their race of course but there is a sort of cultural moment happening at the same time that seems to be empowering women candidates to embrace the fact that there are a woman\nOr that they may or may not be a mom that they may or may not be a have different sexual orientation\nI'm In and talk about that as being part of what makes them a viable for this position part of what makes them uniquely qualified to be in the political demand rather than downplaying that an acting more like a male candidate might and we're seeing a lot of ads that are kind of um\nYou know echoing the same themes that I'm a woman\nI'm complicated I'm not necessarily all the stereotypical than than in trades nor am I going to pretend like I'm the stairs which vote typical a male candidate I I Am in person\nHear all the things about me that make me qualified to run um I I'm just like your you know your neighbor and and I care about this community right um and so that's very different from where\nMaybe we've seen before either women go all the way towards where I'm a mom and I'm I'm you know there's a sort of Patty Murray I'm a mom in tennis shoes image or our candidates kind of shirk all the feminine qualities entirely an ass\nAct more like male candidates I think we're seeing more of a complicated image a emerge from from this moment and it's really interesting to watch but we don't know whether or not that will be successful yet uh I think it may\nKitty what about attack ads are we going to see a change in in those as well in terms of who's putting them out I mean it seems that maybe men have more of the attack ads than women women focus more on their accomplishments or what they'd like to accomplish I don't know that could be completely untrue I'm just asking you what the trends are or maybe\nTraditionally women have been more reticent to go negative because of this sort of fear that that will look I'm not feminine that that will not a comport with how voters like to see women candidates [noise]\nUm but given that we're sort of seeing a all of the sort of traditional those numbers about how women should run being challenged at this moment there is a I I Would say very real chance that we'll see more women go on the negative go on the attack\nAnd and and that's not a bad thing right I think as voters a hero candidates go on the attack as as being an overall a negative thing for us but what we know from the research is that negative ads actually help people learn better than positive ads and that negative ads\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThat we'll see more women go on the negative go on the attack\nAnd and and that's not a bad thing I think as voters a hero candidates go on the attack as as being an overall a negative thing for us but what we know from the research is that negative ads actually help people learn better than positive ads and that negative ads are more memorable\nSo certainly for a candidate a it it's better to have all of those sort of adds an all of those start strategies and your tool box and if you're a woman uh of course you should be able to use both negative and positive ads whatever will help your your base\nMore than most about you and in some cases that might be negative uh in particular if the other candidate is already going negative against you that needs to be in a way that you should feel comfortable responding I'm One of the things we still kind of slipped on its hadn't put he's sixteen is oftentimes\nAh that the kind of ... was that women avoid emotional ads because they don't want to see sort of playing to someone in traits but we actually saw Hillary have primarily emotional ads and twenty sixteen whereas\nA Trump did not have a as emotional adds even though we may think because we think of him as being sort of over the top and and be larger than life\nA surprisingly his ads were primarily policy are much more so policy based than hers um so we might see that in twenty Eighteen as well that a female candidate sort of embrace\nThe strategy of the emotional appeal whether it's a more positive emotions like enthusiasm hope or more negative emotions like anger if you're which also can be very effective\nThat with Kathleen ... assistant professor of political communication with a joint appointment in the political science department and
