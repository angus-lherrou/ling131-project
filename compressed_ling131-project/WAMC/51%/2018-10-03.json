shed light on the hidden rules that make life as a woman unnecessarily difficult and in ... she deconstruct these roles in a way described as bold provocative and hilarious I asked her why she wrote the book\nWell I've been talking about feminist issues using the lens of comedy for almost ten years now and I just started getting really frustrated with the books that I was reading on feminism 'cause I felt like they were very much coming from it\nReally you know academic place which I can appreciate but for someone like me who grow up in the south and it didn't really came to feminism very late life\nI wanted to write something that was a little more accessible for people who were you know ... on feminist propaganda all the time\nSo late in life it's subjective or what is good for you and and how did you come to it\nWell I had a friend who gave me a copy of students reviews backlash my second year of college and that kind of catch me over I always been a light feminist but I I did a lot of stuff in my life that I look back at it I think we're very\nMuch an expression of internalized sexism and I didn't really realize I was your things until I started reading backlash and seeing just a small ways that women are marginalized\nThat was the tipping point for me and then I just kind of got addicted to knowing more and now here I Am today but even that book it you know is given to me by a friend she was vouch for it she was saying to read it at your own reasons why\nSo if you don't have a friend like that and you don't have some sort of in trade a entrance to figuring out your are your marginalized\nI wanted to write a book that was easy easier for women to see these things without getting overwhelmed by house that they are and by the way I mean the issues\nWhen you are an intellectual urine feminism and you're trying to change things [noise] it is really really hard to take a step back and try to find the humor in it because it affects me personally it was very personal it's a personal attack on a lot of things\nThat we should have the rights to our body autonomy decisions money power all of these things\nSo I think a lot of people's reaction to things that are overwhelming is protect us not happening or get really angry about it and kind of get\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a

the people who are doing this to us so that we can actually take their power away and change things\nSo what is your hope that readers take from your book\nWell I Hope people will take away that they have the power to change things and it doesn't need to seem as overwhelming as the news or you know women and our family might make it out to be it is very sad and I think your power religion that but I don't think\nWhat about a disservice there's a there's a couple of actresses who call themselves humanist\nKind of dance around feminine them like we don't really need feminism I think that's really dangerous I think using the word humanist is get skirting the issue that we need to separate we need to use the word feminism because we just need it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nUse the term humanist we can be like I'm for all human but until then when

and just be just exist we have to delineate anything else you'd like to point out Aaron\nSo I Try really hard to make the intersection oh and I'm for those who may be unfamiliar with that\nThere was a problem that's country with white feminism where white women are very concerned about their issues but can't see the the myriad of ways that sexism hurts and harm um women of color and trans women and so I think it's important with this book\nBecause I didn't have time to like really talk about all the issues that I Want to talk about I tried every single chapter to parse out how these issues affect women of color differently\nAnd I think it's important that when we're looking at the things we need a change in this country that we as women think about that and think about how our experiences not her experience and her experience as an artist grant or have to take all those\nLessons and listen to everybody and try to fix this country and its laws so\nThat everyone when\nThat
