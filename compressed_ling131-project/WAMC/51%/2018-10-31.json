with a record number of female candidates running for office despite increasing representation in Congress however some research suggests women have lots of political clout now than in the Nineteen fifties from the ways and means podcast here's Carol Jackson\nIn Nineteen Seventy two when she was thirty one patch wrote her husband convinced her to run for a house seat in Colorado at the time women made up less than three percent of Congress there wasn't even a woman ... local school board\nEvery medium person would say to me how can you be congresswoman and a mother and I got through about forty in those questions and on the forty first I think I said I have a brain and I have a uterus and they both work\nRan on anti Vietnam War platform and she won she spent the next quarter

anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\n... they had a lot of political clout women voted and they were organized in a in in every congressional district so members of Congress are actually listening to what these women's groups were doing\nCautious research shows contrary to popular belief women in the Nineteen fifties were not tied by their apron strings to their shows during World War too many of them did go to work think Rosie the riveter after the war many women in America joined local and national groups and we're actively supporting causes they cared about\nThings like international relations poverty health juvenile justice all sorts of issues that you wouldn't normally think of as quote unquote women's issues\nBut as women became more independent and started working outside the home they had less time\nLarge groups like the league of women voters and the general federation of women's clubs and the American association of university women shed members and didn't turn political leverage without these groups backing them female politicians lost a certain degree of clout\nSo if you have you know a token woman in some position of power she's not necessarily gonna feel comfortable advocating for some of the perspectives are concerns that women as a group might share a she might actually be penalize for that\nSchroeder who left Washington in Nineteen Ninety seven says women are sorely needed in today's government she remembers being criticized in the late eighties for crying in his speech while she toyed with the idea of running for

upon the role of male privilege and entitlement Vassar College is Dr ... is an expert on sexual abuse in the Catholic Church I spoke with her about the correlation ... play during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThe result was SAT vocabulary the first in a series of interactive card games that challenged players with questions to get everyone talking laughing and learning\nA for a gaffe Laura why she decided to create word to users\nWell you know they say that that invention is a necessity is the ... the reason for everything and in this case it was a\nReason why I created the company my son was studying for SAT's but he was dyslexic and had a lot of trouble he could memorize anything he ... he had a lot of trouble understanding that word it in context so I figured they had to be a fun way to help them learn these words and as a mom\nDo whatever you can to try to help your child so I created a series of just fun car of they were actually a sentences on index cards that we would do at the dinner table and we'd ask each other questions and his dad would ask questions and his brother would ask questions that we started laughing and talking as along the way we\nDiscovered that he actually learned the words and their their meaning so that was how the company was born\nSo you know as a fifty year old woman you know why was starting a business like this particularly meaningful for you you had a long career in corporate you know educational publishing why it to the one did you decide to adjust it all in and start something entrepreneurial new\n[laughter] that's a great question actually when I was thirty nine years old I was diagnosed with breast cancer and as you can imagine that kind of rocked my world as well as like families rolled I um fortunately was I Am a survivor and survive\nA pretty grueling episode with that but I came to understand that there was a lot more in life that I wanted to do\nBeyond just working for a company and they really dreamed of having something that I could do my own boss come up with all my own creative ideas and\nPursue it the way I wanted to pursue it but still have time spent with my family so when I\nCame up with this idea for my son [noise] people would come over to our house and say well a great idea you really should publish that you should do something with it and the ... in the light bulb went on and thought oh this is it and that's how that's what prompted me to do it it also was a time in my life where my\nBoth went on and touch [laughter] this is it and that's how that's what prompted me to do it\nIt also it was a time in my life where my kids are growing up like was way off to college going say crispy cheese yeah there was filing red hunted so I often think of this is the new baby in the house [laughter] kept me motivated interested in just I'm engaged with the world\nYeah such about his way of giving back you know two and helping others who are well sure when your same situation you know now that the companies about ten years old I Know you have Fifteen different games now to expand and well beyond the SAT vocabulary game\nWhat's on the horizon for warranty there's and you know how people using the games that you're making\nWell on the horizon are always new games I'm fascinated by sort of quirky information so I'm always looking for something new that I Want to explore personally I think if you like what you're\nYou're writing about her having a writer's right about that it's you're going to embrace it it's going to be easier to sell and I think that people like these little sound bites nuggets of information so you you never know what's going to turn up next to Mike I'm another edition of America trivia or cruel and fascinating facts\nI think what really inspires me the most is the way my customers are the people that bought the games come back to me and tell me how much they like\nPlaying with it I got a letter from someone the other day um who took to it just amazes me took the time to write to me to tell me how she uses the game and\nApparently what she ... she's fought several of them and she ah has\nStarted doing things with her granddaughters to get them to understand how important is to volunteer and they live in upstate Vermont somewhere I won't get to where they\nTake a couple of my trivia games and visit nursing home and sit and talk to a lot of the residents that may not have people coming to visit them and they she said what's so fun is that gets\nThe residents who may not be too communicative to start talking and reminiscing and laughing and she said it's taught her ... her grandchildren not just a whole new um appreciation of\nThe elderly and I I thought wow isn't that a cool thing huh and so inspiring because that's what he how these games inspired somebody to use them I have I also have a a\nKindergarten teacher who wrote to me and said that she uses believe it or not the SAT edition with her kindergarten kids and she said you know kids can learn big words we just don't teach them so she has her being a word of the week and works all week on one were from the addition to get the kids to use it to understand it to be able to spell it\nAnd then they come home and they impressed your parents [laughter] which I find that just so creative and find and wish that wasn't my kids are good in the class like that\nSo how I Need to [laughter] me [laughter] and I feel like\nYou know there's the one of the the thing is it's so fantastic is that it's you know it's not an app it's not on their phones that they actually talked to one another that they have it you know that they have a car that they actually are sitting at the dinner table or you know I think we're all looking for ways\nWhere we can interact with our families face to face again and I just think you know were teachers\nI only lived that I well I agree you share and I think that that the art of conversation is something that we're losing and I think that we're all understanding that we're losing it and we have to figure out a way to bring that back to the different dinner table and put our phones that I've actually even had a couple um retailers suggest that I\nTreat some scientists say this is this is again that's a no phone zone and I think\nThat's really important that we no matter what age you are that we can
