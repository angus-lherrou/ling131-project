with fifty one percent Sarah legit and now writer Dr Jerry burn shares her point of view on a potential her\nI heard about something amazing cutting edge and a bit terrifying\nI Can't decide if it's a cool technological advancement or a digital Frankenstein monster so you be the judge you're probably familiar with the names Jacob and we'll him grim day or the famous German brothers who published over two hundred stories in Germany and the nineteenth century\nNow even if you don't know their names or their book you probably know some of their stories many of which are versions of now world famous tell\nStories like rumbled still skiing the frog print Cinderella little red riding hood who the grooms brothers called little red tap and so on\nWell the brothers grin have just published a

very much alive\nHere's the intriguing part the story was composed by artificial intelligence billed as the first bedtime story ever composed by a by an organization called button that developed an algorithm like the ones used in phones to compose predictive text\nThe entire body of grim stories would scan for ... phrases style sequences and words human riders and took that information and sculpted it into a rough story which they fed back into the computer program to test for ... absolutely intended\nGrim nests the process went back and forth until eventually story was written\nThis tell the princess and the Fox is the first bedtime story collectively composed by machine and humans it's supposed to be a calming tail but the composition of processed makes it a little too unsettling for my bedtime\nIt's not the collective story composition is an unprecedented thing in fact that's how the oral tradition works stories are reshaped by each tell her some words turns of phrase in storage sequences are recycled one after another to retail existing stories or craft new ones\nThere are building blocks that remain the same from one version to another but the interpretation is unique to each Taylor\nDeveloping good narrative is a process whether done through the oral tradition or at the keyboard by a solitary writer it isn't easy for humans to do that well\nI mean there are many components in the story well computers can predict words and phrases can their algorithms grasp the emotion the courses through a well taught story an aircraft narrative with meaning that audiences can understand what about writing original stories\nNeil Patel over at slate reports that a I can create original horror stories well they're sort of original prompts from humans are needed to help stories began and then the program takes it from there\nBut because the story types don't need to flesh out characters go on literary tangents or delve too deeply into any back story there not too challenging for a I to execute\nThe okay their stories\nBut are they good and compelling the ... of them well felt thin and balled and dare I say it the language sounded predictable but with one considers the stories to be good bad or\nMet the upshot is that a lot can write horror stories which is if you asked me a horror story itself\nBut as for other kinds of stories authored by algorithm were not there yet\nThat's because the technology is still built on language based prediction knocked\nMeaning in one trial and I was fed a bunch of science fiction screenplay from there on the air I concocted its own short screenplay that filmmakers turned into a video it's a short movie called son spring by the production company and cue\nThe human influence as

conception the Fox was created there are real human writers who took part in the process to help the new grants bedtime fairy tale makes sense\nBut it's a day should come when it's possible for artificial intelligence to make sense on his own doesn't make sense for us to want that\nTo my two cents don't get me wrong I'm no luddite\nI embrace change and innovation like everyone else with the smartphone for an appendage but in the servants of transparency I should also tell you that I'm a professional storyteller words and narrative are my life\nSo in that in mind I like artificial intelligence have predicted abilities and those combined with my understanding of meaning and symbols inspires some this toll being concerned about this idea\nCould a I recreate narratives from history just like the new grants tell to be presented as fact and used to rewrite the past could a storyteller substitute for an ultimately silence the power of human creativity\nSince stories on
