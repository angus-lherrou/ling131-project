Alison down and this is fifty one percent\nYou know no I don't know\nWhen we're talking about women in science we're talking about physics molecular biology or chemistry those kinds of Sciences but what about political science where are the female political scientist when it comes to media or academia\nKathleen Charles and fellow female political scientist got tired of wondering and took action

news poll coverage and the influence of emotional appeal in campaign ads\nWe uh are are merely made up of of men I'm particularly in the academic side so in faculty positions are still primarily men and political science\nAnd what we see is actually that as you go up there are fewer and fewer women so for almost that parity when you look at political science graduate program but there are fewer when you look at assistant professor of political scientists and then even fewer when you look at people that have tenure\nIn far fewer when you look at people that are what we call full professors which for the cop that you can achieve in terms of a faculty member that's part of the problem and the other thing that we see a lot and this is for news outlets in general is that oftentimes recorders will seek out male sources for politics\nAnd so I think part of the problem is not only are there fewer women\nAnd political science academia but also politics is often the whether we we realize that are not as a very male do mean and and so there might be as an infant and tendency to look towards men to speak about issues that we perceive as being more masculine\nSo how do you change that is what are you doing\nIt's very difficult to change 'em but there are some things that people are working on including the um women often stuff organization\nUh the thing that we are trying to do to help you know increase the number of women forces and the news\nI particularly around politics is that we created a website um that was crowd source so ah women experts in political science were

one um the people that you're talking to are primarily men they referred other men um and that's your network so we wanted to have a place where reporters that would like to increase the diversity of their sources\nCould go and easily just search for a key term or something that they're reporting on a story that came up with current events and then find a woman I'm expert that is that an expert in this area that can speak\nTo the issue or the news article that they're working on just make it a little bit easier because we know everybody's busy\nThe news cycle particularly right now just just nonstop um anything we can do to make it just a little bit more of a nudge towards\nI tried to increase the diversity of your sources as in my book or a positive and I think many reporters as also seen it as a real net benefit\nKitty what about attack ads are we going to see a change in in\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nInside maybe men have more of the attack ads than women women focus more on their accomplishments or what they'd like to accomplish I don't know that could be completely untrue I'm just asking you what the trends are or maybe\nTraditionally women have been more reticent to go negative because of this sort of fear that that will look I'm not feminine that that will not a comport with how voters like to see women candidates [noise]\nUm but given that we're sort of seeing all of these sort of traditional those numbers about how women should run being challenged at this moment there is a I I Would say a very real chance that we'll see more women go on the negative go on the attack\nAnd and and that's not a bad thing I think as voters a hero candidates go on the attack\nAs as being an overall a negative thing for us but what we know from the research is that negative ads actually help people learn better than positive ads and that negative ads are more memorable\nSo certainly for a candidate a it it's better to have all of those sort of adds an all of us are strategies near tool box and if you're a woman a of of course you should be able to use both negative and positive ads whatever will help your your base\nWord most about you and in some cases that might be negative or in particular if the other candidate is already going negative against youth that needs to be in a way that you should feel comfortable responding I'm One of the things we still kind of slipped on its hadn't put he's sixteen is\nOftentimes ah that the kind of trope was that women avoid emotional ads because they don't want to see sort of playing to someone in traits but we actually saw Hillary have primarily emotional ads and twenty sixteen whereas\nA Trump did not have a as emotional as even though we may think because we think of him as being sort of over the top and and be larger than life\nA surprisingly his ads were primarily policy are much more so policy based than hers um so we might see that in twenty Eighteen as well that a female candidate sort of embrace\nThe strategy of the emotional appeal whether it's a more positive emotions like enthusiasm ... or more negative emotions like anger and fear which also can be very effective\nThat was Kathleen ... assistant professor of political communication
