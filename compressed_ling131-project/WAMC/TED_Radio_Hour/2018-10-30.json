New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on\nWith me [noise] yeah because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because I mean\nDisability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like even someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bullet\nWe have been ... because like even someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in cans my father's ... what you can do it yet you can can

dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me I have we have [noise] my inner river was very strong and\n[laughter]\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion had been punched one too many times [noise]\nSo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk at five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back\nTo New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and thought like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his Dara [laughter]\nYou know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or their challenges their humor right in\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and then started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the

humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life\nSo we're just hearing from comedian again for sun and she had a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy\nAnd they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patience\n[laughter] yeah I\nI think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean it's a cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie\nCalled the Muslims are coming and not too long after he came out something happened back in New York a place where again usually felt welcomed and accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better fine but\nHad a one not macho own poster campaign right that does not think about Muslim So my fellow comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money weren't an ca for over five months that was approved in into we're supposed to go up\nA the NCAA decided to ban the poster citing political content once\nThey got a couple of those posters here is one that Muslim Muslims [noise] let's see what they have great for a recipe\nFor us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we\nHave to change our fighting bigotry would delightful to try to the fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying I have a couple of dirt comedian took on a major in New York City agency and the comedians want\nAgency and the comedians want\n[noise]\nVery feeling I was like as a blonde or feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we then hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nShe took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and a and it will like it was pretty successful yeah so I mean you know one of our stopped with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called made that religion\nWe're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all tests\nNew Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous pride is like an outdated calendar salivating already and we lose our salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which totally stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of Iran\nAs a pariah it is the\nMan [noise]\nPeople guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was the violence um came from the Koran Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no men has touched me\nAnd it'll be just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax have released not done them so why would we hold Islam to a temperate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh\nYou know a lot of difference with three of them do you never know [noise] and credible that I mean that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love and return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing ... performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found all the way I like to look at it as you\nYou get one person to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and those chuckled add up to some measure of of a popular um shift in perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these chuckle [noise]\nComedian again first uh she's the author of how to make white people laugh\nAnd also to talk of the nation you can find her full talk that dot com [noise]\nSure it's very painfully funny ideas about how humor can telescope with things that on their face\nAren't very funny\nOn the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can be a couple of things that on their face\nAren't very funny as this is this is Lisa\nThis is Kevin real as the guest said the writer and they stand up comedian\nLouis Missouri [noise]\nThat makes sense but\nShe's ... she's ready though [noise]\nOf houses of it was marvelous [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living\nBut being funny\nIs also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or\nA shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person\nWhen I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be the invitation into ideas and thoughts\nAnd stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable on heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time and in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Albany", "day": "30"}
