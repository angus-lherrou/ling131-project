these at my dog hunt S. dot com\nAnd it is [laughter] that says food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big field to hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our you know it was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now do you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Sawyer corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they were any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually\nMade this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\n... and ... like what you're saying earlier a lot of it\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nThink about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're going to be able to get a mango if you want it to NATO you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word or I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you eat everything but you you were a guy that a lot of people look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of my statement and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know of the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because that are broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n[noise]\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that class and I want to make this clear it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming of this point you eat more class you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals on junk food we don't need either of them for health votes have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand were not foreign craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories for our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nYou [noise]\nWriter Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ... dot com um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs right about that yeah great\nBread crumbs talking about the great in sardines great how can you not eat pasta why the hell you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which in paleo come home a housing pastas gonna kill ya\n\nOkay so am I saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate Seventy four percent whacked Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert ... he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so\nThere are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know I

doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI'm especially a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be able to make very very simple it can be a fishing trips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese almost taking people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um [noise] the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUh I Know one of the perfect meal when the fighting with up hot in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with doesn't resonate in then you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed your holiday less stressed Tripoli with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I Try and reach and then you try it and you are sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions which I'm from the province all rose a paradox so used to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill the guy for that so

the Soviets all laugh and not pay slightly basket while you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a boat or a case and bring it back to share with your friends and choke could taste you have in that you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed and your friends are like this is really cheap\nBirthday yeah as you say well how is it something about when the buttons were in the Arab play with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments in certain states would\nMind on all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile in a way to\nMiss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food\n[noise] in fact just Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nIn a good mood food tastes good if you're in a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll break has taught me everything else the thousands of single the smell of assaulting the at the wall of the song box all of that is play against their beer and\nOn

wow so it's like from from a neurological perspective do we fully understand what happening like why that's the case [noise]\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case\nIt's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with a young chef which is if you have here in London and he's been I'm sending our question as several weeks have to be living his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was a soup and people are convinced they can remember in ... when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they remember the experience but I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color and re school days justice all sing the preparation\nBut nothing else but he says their case so I'm In
