I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leaner muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know\nBut why would that be the ... version if it seems like that that technology is a promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a higher I kid you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nYou might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits do inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIf it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what you might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wonders\nShould we be giving that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and saying that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHow secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course but we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years that we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individual children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\n\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it ... embryos to install things like each of the immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher out you\nWere being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] a hamster and Barry is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the unsinkable power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com\n[noise]\nHot today show we're asking a very important question which is\nOkay by the way do you have the answer deem know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I I have a a a an area where we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\n[noise] so what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipped says with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack hair so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just fed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with us [laughter] okay I'll do my best\n[noise] [noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand and two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century [noise] and then that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nManhattan though nature from the historian or ... you got the man has no instinct and the anthropologist asked we want to give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nHochul a scientist Stephen J go without ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people have found congenial foremost and I guess were blind\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature at that time\nIf we were blank slate we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect and then with the of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly interesting and perhaps some of them like damage to selfishness prejudice and violent [noise]\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to go for the human mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child no fat can come into the world with certain
