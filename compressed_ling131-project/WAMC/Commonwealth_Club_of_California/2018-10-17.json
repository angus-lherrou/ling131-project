partisanship and his role in significant political moments like the Iran nuclear deal\nWe're so excited to have him with us here today to discuss these issues as well as the future of our democracy\nLadies and gentlemen please join me in a warm welcome to John Kerry\n[noise]\nSo I tell you sat down and wrote this book what stimulated you to become so reflective about the span of your life and your service\nWell first of all let me begin by by saying thank you too I'm Gloria\nSo the commonwealth club I I really I'm happy to be here this is a great organization I've had the privilege of being part of your conversations previously or even just making a speech a and it's really fun to be back in one of my favorites is in the world San Francisco so I'm happy to be here\nAnd thank you all for taking the time to come out and I hope the the the sort of part of your check list in terms of good citizenship because we have a lot to talk about right now [noise]\nAh\nWe really do is I mean the question of what our facts in life but how do we make our politics work there's so much to talk about I was the other day I noticed this really is true there was a report on info wars\nThat Hurricane Lane was bearing down on Hawaii had been split into by an energy being was fired from Antarctica by me [laughter]\nUm [noise]\nAnd and I thought well I I thought I thought to myself now we're really a ... this is terrible stuff how can they ... how did they missed the fact that I fired at from from the north pole\nBut seriously I very upset that they ever call David ... action for Florence coming out on the east coast but this is just we're dealing with a whole different world and for those of us who really do love our country and who consider ourselves patriots and who are on or the role of troops and\nThe sustaining of our democracy or this is a very\nPearl is an important moment so I look forward very very much to the conversation\nI think you know there'll be lots of questions from the audience but tell us again why did you sit around and reflect on your lawn out I live by that I think you actually you gave part of the answer\nNo no no I yeah I did get our news or\nI I did it because I think it's relevant to the moment that we're in I think Bob Woodward's book is a terrific summary an extraordinarily well reported as he does and every one of you in here knows that there is no way has publisher observing my publisher to and there is no way that she\nIs going to go to print without the lawyers being confident about sources and what he does yes\nAnd there is no way that he is going to go to print without the lawyers being confident about sources and what he does his hundreds of hours of tapes so people need to be careful what they wish for in terms of documentation here and yellow or you're going to hear denials here and denials there but\nI think everybody knows how it works my book is the sort of okay it's terrible\nWe now have the facts that document what is happening\nBut what do we do about it and what should America look like what should we be doing in terms of making our system work and bring ourselves back to ground zero [noise]\nDamn democratically little D\nAnd um I think my book in the tracing of the things I've been involved in from the beginning of my raising my right hand there's a chapter called raising our right hand where I talk about why we went in the service my my parents were greatest generation parents my mother\nI'm born in Paris or live the better part of our earlier not better by all of her early life in Europe because my grandfather was a was a\nBusinessman involved in a business in Europe at the time and live between England and France right up until World War two and a actually way back when he was involved with the surge in any in the founding of the bank of America\nAnd to my regret sold his stock too early [laughter] uh [noise] uh so my mother didn't come to America really into ... about twenty four years old [noise]\nBut she's American she comes from the Boston family and and she lived there and that introduced me to war at a very young stage I write in the book about how my earliest memories walking with my mother in France Nineteen forty seven I was four years old and holding her hand and she was crying\nAnd I didn't know why she was crying it upset me but\nI could feel that you could hear the glass crunching beneath my feet\nAs we walk through the ruins of what had been the family home and all that I remember seeing a chimney go up into the sky and the and a stairwell going up into the sky it was all of us left I remembered visiting the beaches Normandy four years after the war there was still the ... civil war on those beaches\nYou know blown out tanks and so forth Higgins boats\nAnd it became it it it it just didn't viewed me with a sense of service sense of duty sense of responsibility\nAnd a group of us at Yale uh my good friend Freddie Smith the founder of FedEx who\nFounded FedEx really in our dormitory when he got to see and is economics paper that that was fed ex\nUm and it's an a plus now ... a plush slash uh and and my room mate daddy by our bureau in into the Marines and and you know a bunch of us felt a sense of responsibility Nineteen sixty five Lyndon Johnson asked for troops and then we were part of that answer [noise]\nSo I write this because I think all of that journey without any arrogance without any sense of why outlook and me or something that's not what it's about I think it's an American story I think it's an American journey\nAnd I think it represents how you make America the best of what we know it can be because in Nineteen Seventy one made a president who broke the law\nThat it was adopted and what I argued in a very tense meeting couple of nights earlier when it almost fell apart as people were arguing to go back to the old formula about developed countries doing more and less developed countries which is a killer formula\nI pointed out that this was the single\nMost gala Terry and shared responsibility you could have lie because each country decided itself what it was going to do and no country decided to do anything that he couldn't do\nThat is why President Trump outright lied to Americans today pulled out\nBecause he stood up in front of the country and said this agreement pushed to greater burden on the United states and the answer is no it didn't\nIt only undertook to do what we knew we could do with us support of major fortune five hundred companies ranging from the Google and the apples and so forth all the way to Exxon Mobil\nAnd BP and others all of them said we need to do this so we cannot have parts of what was the significance of powers the significance of Paris is that we\nBasically put our faith and the private sector which I Believe I I've grown more and more private sector oriented over the years because as you watch the world changing as the dynamic changes we're witnessing industrial revolution sized changes and culture and society and workplace\nIn trade and in in globalization but it's happening\nCulture and society and workplace in trade and in in globalization but it's happening at digital pace is unprecedented\nAnd that's part of the anger that is filled American workers and the American people because they feel increasingly disenfranchised and shocked and shell shocked by it all uh and Dutch a lot of the voter that Donald Trump appeal to by the way it is also a voter the Bernie Sanders appeal to\nAnd it's out there it's also in the center you don't have to be on the right or left to feel that way government is not working in America folks and we know in some of the reasons why and what we have to do about it but the bottom line with respect to climate changes we were trying to send a message in Paris to the private sector\nOne hundred and Ninety six countries are all going to move in the same direction at the same time and that creates the largest market the world has ever seen\nThe energy market and why energy because energy is the solution to climate change there's nothing we can do to change the course were on that isn't subject to making better decisions about how we create electricity what we do with our buildings how we burn oil or gas or coal and other things and how we move to a renewable sustainable\nFuture the market that I knew in Massachusetts I represent Massachusetts twenty eight years we had a terrific tech base not quite Silicon Valley but\nIn the early years very very strong and still strong and we had a one trillion dollar market in the Nineteen nineties with with what a one billion users the energy market is today four to five billion user market and among type trillion dollar market\nAnd it's going to grow to nine billion users and the next Thirty years is the biggest market the world has ever seen and by Donald Trump pulling out of Paris he's pulled us out of the position of leadership and in that market\nSo but here's the rub this is why I said I'm going to be the skunk Paris goal was to keep the rise in the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade\nWe're probably right around one point three one point five already today we're right there but my friends in this century my grandchildren yours I'm going to live to experience\nA four degree rise in temperature for degrees is what we are on track to see now what you see barreling towards the coast the Carolinas today\nThe size of the storm intensity that repetitive with which it formed\nIs a direct consequence of the warming of the water and the increase of the moisture you have therefore in the air and therefore more rain\nHarvey Irma and Maria\nAll deposit at one storm Harvey alone deposit it as much water as flows over Niagara Falls and an entire year\nFive days of flooding and Irma was the first storm to have a recorded one hundred and eighty five miles an hour sustain for\nTwenty four hours together these storms caused those two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of the entire budget of the defense department and more money than the Commerce Department the Energy Department of education department the by the whole bunch of departments together this is insanity insanity\nAs secretary of state I went to Norfolk, Virginia and the largest navy base in the world and we talked with the military but what they're having to do because\nOf the preparations they debate because of climate change and the rise of sea level I went to Antarctica because when I went to the Arctic the scientist there said Mr Secretary you got to go in the Arctic go to really understand what's happening in terms of the changes so I went to Antarctica\nAnd lo and behold yeah I heard from scientists room Seventeen different countries about the repetitive with which the west Antarctic ice sheet which is three and a half miles deep ice is melting and and shows a Fisher\nLarson ice sheet broke off larger than the size of the state of Rhode Island and floated out to sea and they're afraid that the whole thing may melt ... way we're going to him\nShe broke off larger than the size of the state of Rhode Island and floated out to sea and they're afraid that the whole thing may melt rent wait we're going the Himalayan glaciers melting glaciers are disappearing\nAll over the world we're seeing the diminished ... of the cycle and now you have an open seat in in the northwest passage in the summertime\nAnd people trying to exploited I mean it's changed last year for the first time in history\nWe're recorded above freezing temperatures in the Arctic in February so you know I get angry when I when I think about this\nDonald Trump's decision to pull out of that agreement is going to cost lives it just is as good a cost billions of dollars of damage to property and you're going to witness some of it and the next ... hours next days but that's just the beginning\nWe've had an average of seven hurricanes here since Nineteen Seventy two in the Atlantic which is more than normal and now they're two other hurricanes behind warns that are sort of building out there so my friends what do you do about it\nWhat is the solution but I'd be doing well I'll tell you what the ... United States and if I were president today I Would have an emergency meeting of the G twenty\nI take the richest countries in the world and I said we're not leaving the room to we put together\nA climate action fund that helps less developed countries not have to build a coal fired power plant\nAnd we should stop every single coal fire power plant in the world from being ...\nThat's what we have to do why the dirtiest fuel in the world and it is the single biggest culprit with respect to global climate change and we're at a point now where we are locked in not just to preventing this from happening were locked into mitigation adaptation so we're going to have to do things like the Dutch do\nTo prevent see from coming into the country this below sea level but guess what a lot of other places have got to find that challenge already the mayor of Miami is pumping water out of Miami Beach\nAnd the mayor of Miami Beach at night is pumping water out in order to get sunny day high tide flooding out of the way\nSo we have water coming over the Boston I'm In in in Boston at the seawall you know that comes in at a high tides any day now so my friends long answer to you but I got to tell you something this is one of the most serious issues we face is existential it is solvable\nThere's no excuse for not moving more rapidly to alternative renewable energy solar is now completely competitive with cold it's cheaper than coal 'cause there's no there's no truth and accounting I don't know how many of your business\nBut you know there's no truth and accounting in in this business today people say oh Cole is a three or four cents a kilowatt hour and solar is going to be sex with solar isn't a solar is letting contracts in the world at two point nine cents per kilowatt hour and so forth but coal\nWhich it doesn't ever taken the cost\nOf coal sludge coal dust black lung moving it by train or trucks from wherever it comes from the burning the cost of emphysema the cost of of of you know the single biggest cost of children being hospitalized America during the summer is environmentally induced asthma\nWe spent fifty five billion dollars a year to deal with that and we can't find a hundred billion dollars to fund the ... and ...\nSo I'm just telling you folks were the greatest democracy in the world we're not making choices about the future we've got to start to reclaim our democracy and reclaim our future by making real choices it's that simple [noise]\nThis is the commonwealth of California radio program\nYou can learn more about the commonwealth fund its many programs and how to become part of it coming\nCommonwealth club Don more you can find thousands of our podcast sign I tend to Google Play today's program features John Kerry in conversation with me now back to our program [noise]\nAnd we're experiencing a lot of the impact here in California we had a couple of hundred thousand acres gone up in flames this last year the smoke the health consequences of the smoke\nUh we have a seawall issue here in San Francisco on time [noise]\nSo if in fact our ability to accomplish the things that the federal level is impaired at this point there's a certain amount of us thought that states are going to have to take the lead a and I think that's Jerry Brown's attitude a he's just a announced a\nAn objective of having a California run completely on clean fuels by the year twenty forty five so what do you think about this idea that the the unit of the political unit for focus is really states at this point\nNames from the past but it extended and and went further and both parties have made contributions to it\nAnd fights that took place in the Senate for one reason or another there are\nAnd and went further and both parties have made contributions to it and fights that took place in the Senate for one reason or another there are arguments about what happened to John Tower nominated circulated fence their arguments or what happened to Robert Bork blah blah blah\nBut really it took hold in the Nineteen nineties where the Gingrich revolution people that I saw this people band that come over to the Senate who are just more ready to say ideology first one way my way or the highway little less involvement\nAnd you have people have tried to block that a little bit Jeff Flake from Arizona\nAnd and Bob Corker a little bit from Tennessee\nA but it's been tough it's been tough but I Believe you asked me what can we do look folks I Hope don't let this sound naive because I think in my book as you ... you'll see the the continuum that\nPeople make the difference every one of the major movements that may change happen when it needed to in the late Nineteen sixties civil rights\nMartin Luther king kids some of my classmates we raise money for the freedom buses the freedom rides where people get on those buses and go down south to register people to vote in Mississippi and Alabama places\nThe Mississippi voter registration drive drove us motivated and run really in large measure by young people the environment ... young people the anti war movement Sam Brown David mixture bunch of people young people did that marched link are these ... they took time off from school they went and made a difference\nI Believe in that still we called them the peanut butter and jelly brigade they went up to New Hampshire\nThey they supported Gene McCarthy they send a message to the president nine states Lyndon Johnson\nYou shouldn't run again and it was after the march primary that Lyndon Johnson took himself out of it so look at what I said about Earth Day look at what I said about environmental legislation look at what happened in terms of accountability for Watergate and then the Watergate babies who went to Congress and what we were able to do\nSo yeah it moves slowly sometimes it's not as responsible as you'd like it'd be Winston Churchill said that democracy is the worst form of government except for everything else think about it we've tried everything in the world ladies and gentlemen\nWe've had dictatorships all over the place we had a monarch for a while here till we threw off the yoke of that we've had constitutional monarchy we've had parliamentary Marta ... we've had socialism we've got communism we've had\nYou name it we've we've we've seen it experimented with one place or another and I still believe very very deeply that if you work at it properly and and the public is able to hold people and things accountable and you go vote\nYou can make a difference and here's the magic number fifty four point to that is the percentage of eligible Americans who voted in twenty sixteen when block Obama was elected in two thousand and eight it was sixty two\nPoint three percent when he was reelected against Romney it was fifty eight point five I think they see the gap the story of the last election is not the people who did go out to vote for Donald Trump's people who didn't vote and nine percent of Iraq Obama's vote went\nTo Trump and seven percent did not come out and vote that's sixteen percent\nThat swing that's why I Believe as I said here today I'm not kidding you I'm not Pollyanna air ... I'm not being naive\nWe can make our democracy work but it is work it's hard work you have to go out and be part of the family you have to drive people to go vote you have to go vote yourself you've got to give money to campaign so it can compete you've got to take part in it and and ...\nYou have to drive people to go vote you have to go vote yourself you've got to give money to campaign so it can compete you've got to take part in it\nAnd and ... I I just ask you remember the words of Ben Franklin when he walked down the steps of constitution hall after they had finished their labor on the next generation of the constitution the United states and a woman shouted at him Dr Franklin tell us what do we have and he said back to her\nOh she said do we have a monarchy or republic and he said a republic if you can keep it if you can keep it that's the work of today I kid you not\nJohn McCain you've talked about other colleagues in the ... a Republican and I all cross or at times you had a long relationship he leaves your fellow Vietnam veteran what do you have to say about John McCain and how how you worked with him and and your relationship with him over the years\nWhile I miss him as as I think America with medicine because he was a a truth teller\nA he knew he had some deviations himself one was on climate change when he was running for president because of the orthodoxy of this party and he was up front about those kinds of things which is one of the things people appreciate that about him but he had a as I wrote in an op ed after he passed away he had a great capacity for forgiveness\nWhich is which is partly what you need and what we need in our politics a little bit in the country\nJohn and I didn't know each other well when we went to this and I got to the Senate before John to try not to let him to get any given day as about two years apart and he came to campaign against me Massachusetts though he never attack may never mention my name and just talk to the other guy I write in the book about how that so that was the way the game was played back then not any more than\nBut in the Senate we were one day\nWe're on a delegation flying to Kuwait after the Desert Storm and a ... Kuwait was just liberated and\nWe flew over to ah talk to the troops and thank them but also to talk to the mirror and the other folks and see where we were going John and I were seated opposite each other he was flying backwards I was lying forward sitting opposite him\nWhich were assigned by seniority that's why it was important and I got there before\nUh and we started you know we we were uncomfortable little bit because I was the war protester and he was a POW so we started to talk about the navy were both navy guys and we both love the navy I Love the navy didn't like war but love the navy\nAnd we talked about I I asked him about Annapolis and what it was like to have a grandfather and a father\nFor scar admirals the weight of that what did that affect them in the in the in the academy and blah blah blah\nSo we had an amazing conversation that night but out of it came a\nWillful determine commitment by the two of us which we made that night on that plane\nThat we were going to work together because we both agreed that the war we still tearing America part is Nineteen eighty this Nineteen Ninety Ninety One and so we decided we're going to work together to try to make peace peace with the non\nAnd peace with ourselves in America and it began with the\nSort of ability to look beyond how we felt about each other's positions on the war he was pro war he came back as a upset at the people who are protesting the war because his war stopped the day was shot down Nineteen sixty seven and you have to hang on everything he had and believe for all those years in prison camp\nMy war was Nineteen sixty eight and sixty nine\nAnd when I came back I got to go around the country and argue against the war so we came from very different places\nBut my friends we we found the most amazing common ground we worked together for ten years to try to change that and um we all believe did we first with George Herbert Walker Bush we lifted the embargo with President Clinton we normalized ah we're we we mostly ... answer the questions for ...\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've ... in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nWith the system to be able to know what happened to somebody in a last scene last known alive report and there was a mythology remember in the early Nineteen nineties a cover of Newsweek had are they still alive prisoners in Vietnam and tiger cages and there was a mythology Rambo food films\nThat we'd forgotten people over there\nSo we have to undo that first and we went to amazing lengths to do it we went back to Vietnam I went back with John McCain\nWe we ... we had helicopters flying into hamlet sway the sound of the helicopter would bring back horrible memories of the war we we had a history houses we'd go in and talk to the people we actually interviewed general job and we interviewed the jailers of John McCain and his and the fellow prisoners\nSo we had this most exhaustive effort and in the end ladies and gentlemen I'm so proud that that that not only be get the answers and that's ongoing today today is we're sitting here in this theater we got American Soldiers on the ground and yet I'm trying to get remains back for families\nAnd and John McCain and I visited the cell he was in together we stood together and and I realized then that we had found this special common ground\nAnd if a POW at a protest or can do that about Vietnam in Hanoi we can do that anywhere in this country and make things better it's a it's a great story about what people can\nDo [noise] um [noise]\nTurning to another Asian country with which we have a ... relationship if you are a secretary of state what would you be doing about North Korea today\nWe did you know there's not a great I mean there's a ... style and in the process but an objective and based approach\nWe we wanted to try to sit down with North Korea we we tried very hard to get the north Koreans to come to the table but we were tougher in wanting certain definitions defined before we did so mind you\nKim Jong un's father and grandfather both wanted\nA meeting with the president United States and they never got it why did they never get it because we were never able to get satisfaction with respect to what they were willing to define or not to fine I think that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "city": "Albany", "day": "17"}
