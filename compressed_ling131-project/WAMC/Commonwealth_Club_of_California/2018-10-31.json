important topics of the day when Donald Trump was a candidate for president he said he\nTo get a chance [noise] asking them what they had to lose however since the beginning of the Trump Administration racial bias country and racist organization than ideology we invited Fox one willing to come to the\nStation about what has happened to civil rights in America\nHe was in conversation with Dr James Taylor of the University of San Francisco\nNow let's join one Williams and James Taylor conversation\n\nThank you all for being here this evening were really excited to have this time to talk to Mr Juan Williams a welcome to the commonwealth club [noise] [noise]\n[noise] you can find the commonwealth club on line as a commonwealth club dot org on Facebook and Twitter and on the clubs YouTube channel I'm James Taylor professor politics at the University of San Francisco former president of the national conference of black political scientist and you're moderator for the program and it's my pleasure to introduce today's distinguished guest Juan\nWilliams political analyst and coast of the five on Fox and also the new book what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil

rights missile Williams joined Fox News or the contributed in Nineteen Ninety seven project that he served as a senior national correspondent new download at NPR for more than a decade and before that he spent twenty three years at the Washington Post\nDuring the course of his career Mr we also received widespread critical acclaim for his theory of documentaries including politics the new black power and forty six books including the nonfiction bestseller eyes on the prize America civil rights Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen sixty five and his new book Mr Williams argued\nThat while President Trump considers himself a protectorate for African American communities around the nation his words and actions demonstrate otherwise to discuss the state of civil rights and the country in general please welcome Mr Juan Williams\n[noise]\nSo how we have a diplomat you know you've been thinking about your questions that you can sum it up here to ask Mr Williams and I'll just sort of get us started but I really wanted to just give him an opportunity to sort of just give us a\nA synopsis of the book from the outset in his own words as to what sort of motivated him and and what I'm all went into play when he thought about this book the writing of it um and just sort of the whole engagement with this this tax as compared to maybe other books that you've written\nA professor Taylor it's a pleasure to have you with me and the pleasure to be here at the commonwealth club thanks to all of you for coming out\nThis afternoon this is a a tricky subject because racist so waited in our society for so many centuries not just in the current uh look\nBut the reality is that we are at a critical moment so normally for me\nTo answer to an answer to your question professor I have been a tremendously interested in the history of civil rights in the United states and the\nThe figure is the people who have been central to promoting social change on the most difficult issue of race so I've written\nA biography of Justice Marshall ... off you look back at eyes on the prize you can see that I'm very interested in people who were change agents\nIn this society so I'm Talking about\nPeople like you know Chaney Goodman and Schwerner going down south in Freedom Summer Nineteen sixty four who are these people who would put themselves at risk for the greater good and in that case become martyrs to the cause but in this moment\nI don't think there's much question that if you look at where we are as Americans with regard to race you'd say you know in the words of Charles Dickens that was the best of times and it was the worst of times\nIn the sense that it's the best of times you know in my lifetime just ten years ago we saw the election of a black president a black man is president of United States in my lifetime\nWe've seen the first black billionaire we've seen people emerge or in terms of the coach from you in a way that unimaginable people from Michael Jackson to Kendrick Lamar\nAh we've seen people from Denzel Washington to Jennifer Hudson would Academy Awards\nOr you know we've seen the first chair of the joint chiefs of staff the first secretary of state African Americans it's I can keep going in this way it's really been an incredible period a tremendous gains\nAnd most of all maybe the gain in terms of the black middle class in this country and again in terms of black political power right now we have a record number of black people serving in the U.S Congress record number of women serving in the\nStreaming support for WAMC come from ... Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills in support for a long term success with we've got struck me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nRight now people say that worse race relations are worse than they've ever been right now half of the American people forty nine percent say the president is a racist including eleven percent of Republicans\nSo you've come to think what what has happened how could it be that we have such tremendous progress such tremendous growth in terms of the black middle class black political voice black political opportunity record numbers of graduates from high school and college\nAnd yet people think race relations are going down the two I think you and I both know the answer\nHas to do with the rise of Donald Trump Trump who comes on the political scene with the birther movement saying that the first black president wasn't even an American that he's an illegitimate president\nSome kind of Machiavellian candidate Donald Trump who then comes down the golden escalator at Trump Tower and begins calling Mexicans rapists and criminals Donald Trump who goes on in terms of the kind of rhetoric that he uses to\nTalk about a black woman as a dog\nTo talk about NFL players who Neal in protest of police brutality during the anthem as s obese who should be fired\nA Donald Trump who says at one point that are an American born judge a Mexican parents cannot be fair to him can't do his job causing the speaker of the house Republican Paul Ryan to say that was the epitome of a racist statement\nThis is Donald Trump\nAnd he has successfully appealed\nTo white anger and fear in this society\nEven as the society is becoming more diverse and especially if we've seen an increase in the number of immigrants so he has become a force of the vision racial division ... division in terms of class in terms of so many\nAh points of division in this society he has been willing to exploit for political advantage so I'll stop there but at\nThe same time you you ground his own orientation in the anti seeding party\nOf of the Republican Party itself and that you kind of outline the ways in which there he's not the first one and he sort of not an outlier maybe in terms of his lack of decorum but in terms of the substance of his ideas you put him along the continuum of\nThere is a continuing to be but what you have to understand is that since the sixties since the passage of the sixty four civil rights act since the passage of the sixty five voting rights act as you know at that point President Johnson says we've lost the south now for a generation right\nThe south went from being mostly democratic to mostly Republican in the aftermath of those\nMoves and we know that President Nixon played to a southern strategy with just that in mind we know that someone like President Reagan opened his campaign by going down to Mississippi gr\nEr and going to the show the county fair or the county where Goodman Chaney Goodman is one or were killed a and people had lots of questions and we know\nBe put to use for black political outcomes in the way you'd like to see I I'm not quite in other words they'll be racist and he did more for blacks than any other president American\nHis I don't I Can't Donald Trump I think I think when you have to say on this yeah because I think LBJ came from Texas came out of that Dixiecrat\nWhole attitude and tradition\nA but he is someone who would work I think he was a schoolteacher in fact right with\nA Mexican children down in border communities he had a sense of that and I think he had a sense\nOf feeling as if he could be larger than life he could be a liberator and that in the winter and Asian Barry Goldwater was that way too while he beat go water and member and he he\nPilloried go water for his racial attitudes around the civil rights so that's why I resist the parental care of your question OK I'm OK\nOkay um so this question is do you find it difficult to talk about race relations while Trump is in office while you're working on Fox News [laughter] [noise]\nI can tell you I I I think if there was a a different kind of audience I rip off my shirt his show show your car and you know because it's so difficult to have meaningful conversations about race especially with my\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com they're\nThe number one cable channel in America and it's an opportunity I think the parents the bubble in to say hey there's a different perspective and a different experience of life and here it is to to me I'm In the arena on a daily basis and\nAnd so the attitudes and the questions that I have to cope with and the kind of on a lot because I'm the exception not part of the mainstream or it can be heavy\nBut it's just a different reaction when you're in Studio there is one phenomena that happens to you but when you go out the door\nThere's a whole nother reality in terms of how people perceive video logically I think it was saying um that he was saying that sort of when you're out of the studio that oh you mean representative of a sort of liberal perspective in in in in Studio if I'm not mistaken\nWell no I I mean obviously if I'm Talking to Sean Hannity or not I'm not that kind of he inserted right right so you must be the liberal concedes that comes out but it's like that I just give you that as an extreme example but I mean what you ... ... you know in my life\nThink people have often tried to pitch in home you are you left you write right now where do you fit in there and that was my question to an end in so many areas you know it just becomes a question because I say you know what\nI think their policies that have not been productive I think we need to for example I wrote a book called enough ... which was about the failures of black leadership in this time you know black leadership not going after\nCritical issues like why do we have a community is the devil by drug dealers want we aren't there protesting the drug dealers\nOr why aren't we going after\nThe problem of poor quality schools why don't we more aggressive and thing need schools are not serving our commend his best interest as opposed to seeing them as simply providing jobs again often times in the black community but failing the black children and I think that's that's short term mhm a short sighted thinking\nOh you know so on so many levels I'm willing\nTo question the leadership and then people say well that means you must be conservative no I'm just trying to tell you\nI think we have to hold political leaders to account black white Asian Latino if they're not serving the community call 'em out but again that's more outside the studio but at the studio where I work for Fox right\nAm position then and posturing there as the lesson\nButton on this other questions related says I Love you owned the five but how do you prepare for the antics put downs and nonsensical tons of Jesse waters\nAnd I've I and I fast forward through most of what he says it see 'em a raw or is he playing a role or is he just and immature resentful person\n[laughter] well I Hope that I have a chance to come speak to this audience and they're very interesting\nNo I I think again Jesse represents a point of view and finds that for him there are people who are big supporters and people who find his uh his kind of presentation entertaining and it becomes entertainment but I think it's entertainment that sometimes is at a cost and\nA two perceptions of common destiny in common interest and common commonality as American\nRelated question Mr Williams how do you maintain your civility working with your colleagues at Fox News who consistently support an echo actions in words of such despicable and illegitimate of of of of a despicable and the legitimate president [laughter]\nWell again I have to cope\nThe idea that so many of my colleagues are in fact on the Trump bandwagon\nPresident [laughter] well again I have to cope\nWith the idea that so many of my colleagues are in fact on the Trump bandwagon a and I'm willing to challenge it and to speak out against it and again if my hat's\nOff to the idea that I'm there and the audience for the most part likes me so that's the you know that that's a a shock in some ways\nMhm mhm [noise]\nLet's question do you foresee fleas are free [noise]\nUm do you think African Americans should join with Latinos or Hispanics et cetera to be a bigger voting bloc and how do you get participation significantly higher\nWell I think that what you have to do is make it seem urgent\nMhm uh and if people have to see that it's directly impacts their lives now we're coming up on these midterm elections and historically minority communities educating people and Democrats do not turn out in high numbers mhm\nBut I think that because this has become something of a referendum on Trump and because of Trump's behavior including a lot of his racist behavior\nI think there is a sense of urgency and I think you're going to see a larger turnout in terms of the consequences\nSo this is all about your life my life\nOur communities our family\nAnd when people feel that politics makes a difference I think you see them\nBecome activated too often they felt you know what it doesn't make a difference that you know the Democrats might take you for granted a and the Republicans might ignore you but what we have now is a situation where people feel that they are being demonized and belittle mhm\nUh and hopefully that does create a common set of issues that drive them to the polls\nYou write with a sense sense of urgency and that was the question was going to ask you this book is written with a sense of urgency and I you know I've been around you know the last thirty forty years listening to people talk about this concept of race war\nAnd nobody takes has ever taking it seriously when you see Bannon out in Italy I'm Steve Miller in the in the White House um\nDo you take the concept of race war seriously at all I don't know what what you mean the idea that there was this project and I think it was coast that we'll see I see that are written a book called the coming race ... this whole idea that race war is coming and with the president sort of you know flat fanning the flames that you're things he's of fanning\nDo you take that concept that ... we're going to Balkan eyes as a society with these racial divisions in terms of violence\nOr no I don't think that's coming I think that you have episodes where there's racial violence in the country and people act out or it can be somebody\nUh you know in terms of we see it with all too frequent a ... regular without too much regularity of you know the police shooting somebody and saying why did you shoot et cetera and fear of black men and all the rest coming to the forefront but no I think that the nation is on a different track professor which is that we're becoming more diverse and\nA and in my lifetime or\nYou know I like in the book I say you know Trump is Seventy two hundred sixty four ... ...\nYou know eight years different but we lived through this tremendous change in America but he seems to have missed what I saw happening right right and the growth in the black middle class for example to me\nIs the most important thing that happened in my lifetime right right right I mean to compare my life and my father as I say in the back that if\nYou know my father you know lived in in his life was defined by his race in terms of where he lived his neighborhood in terms of his jobs right but for me or you know if he saw me living in an integrated neighborhood if he said you know what\nYou work and have contracts with major American media white owned media you're right\n... if he said you know what you work and have contracts with major American media white owned media you write books for white publishers\nA you know if he saw that his granddaughter my daughter was a graduate of Georgetown University law school who didn't accept black people until the late sixties\nHe said that's a different world and if he saw me at the White House having lunch\nAnd then saw that the other guy sitting there was a black man and realize that he's President Obama say oh my God that's a different universe where I Can't imagine that my dad would say right right so you stop and think about these things that have happened\nIn our lifetime but also in Trump's lifetime ... what an amazing thing forty percent of black America earning between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars in additional twelve percent earning between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nThat means more than half of black America is either on the edge of being\nMiddle class or solidly in it and beyond it mhm but he doesn't plug into that notion of people have sacrificed people have been in the vineyards working hard to allow this to occur instead he focuses I think quite intentionally on the dysfunction that chaos and poor black communities\nAnd uses that disturbed fear and division in the white community\nMeant that there are certain politicians white segregation so we're feeding them the bread of hate mhm that that was what they could say to themselves that they're better than those\nPin ... next question\nIt is increasingly difficult for you this is again a number of Fox questions so there's a bunch here um it is increasingly difficult for you to justify your\nContinued association with Fox given how the network program being has evolved against somebody wants you to comment on that oh well there's another question please explain how Fox News your affiliations supports or denies the plea for racial harmony you original thoughts about\nSolutions so I guess people want to know about you and and your relationship to Fox ... here in many different forms\nWell as I said earlier to me I think that Fox as such a major platform in American media the number one cable news station in the country\nOr is unimportant venue to have somebody come in and ... burst the bubble I have someone come in and offer\nA different set of perspectives in fact mhm so I find myself challenging so many of their top personalities and I'm I'm there every day mhm uh and no one is telling me what to say so to me this is an opportunity it comes at a tremendous cost 'cause I feel a beat up much of the time and I say like oh my God you're not hearing\nBut it's not the case that I Am not in fact thing what I Want to say and trying to reach and it's very interesting to pick up on a point I mean I'm ... I mentioned in passing earlier than\nThat there's so much oftentimes positive response from people that people will say to me at a ball game and the airport and the trains whatever they will say to me you know\nI don't agree with your politics but I like you and I like the fact that you're there you know when I go to the water fountain and I run into people it's not that I haven't heard the other side of the argument and so I'm performing a function there as a foil but I think also as a\nA source of a different perspective\n... I'm this is a kind of a funny one that says you used to be six for you take such a pounding every night or five [laughter] um let's see ah there's a what would you have again that was the repeated when\nDo you think former President Obama was a pot was a net positive or or for race relations he famously believes he was ten to Twenty years too early Obama well you'd think Obama was a ... positive for race relations\nOh I Do uh I think you know looking back on the Obama presidency boy you know I see people in tee shirts and simply say the miss me now\nAnd I think that that's very rare what a contrast in terms of uh you know class that lack of scandal you know all the rest I mean I Can't imagine if President Obama had been involved with a porn star\nHas been you know paying off people lying if his first national security advisor or had pled guilty\nHis campaign manager I think I think he would be long be gone you know I think it will not eat he\nHe's normally have the scandal that we see with ... why I say I just don't think there's any point of comparison with this question is related to this obviously political pressure and negative media attention don't change Trump's mind or behavior so what we'll do you think he will win a second term what will change Trump and will he went again\nI think they're two separate issues one is I don't think there's any changing the Seventy two year old man and a who tells people he's a stable genius\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nI think that definitely applies to Trump [noise] um [noise] as to whether he might win re election well his numbers are just terrible even now um and they creep up at times and there was some good news for the Republicans this week in terms of\nApproval of the party was I think at forty seven just like slightly above Democrats at forty six in one Gallup poll but if you look at for example\nA generic party preference when it comes to this election Democrats haven't\nBeen able to pull away but they still maintain a strong a margin advantage end when it comes to engagement in energy among the voting base Democrats really have a strong advantage going into these midterms so when it comes to the twenty twenty race\nI think it'll have to do with who the Democrats are able to nominate and exactly how\nYou engage Trump because I think that's very difficult as we saw in the Republican primaries if you try to say hey this guy knows very little this guy you know as someone who says outrageous things called people names like cetera uh it's not not necessarily effective with his base\nSo his base is likely to nominate him again I don't know if John Case sake or whoever on the Republican side might hold out and challenged him and I think that's possible\nBut I don't see that person prevailing yeah but once it comes to a general election I think if the Democrats have someone who is able to not only take on front but to contrast\nOffer contrast in terms of political stability mhm\nAnd political experience to Trump and uh I think I think Trump's in big trouble\nYeah wow that's that's I think that's news\nUm what is your perspective on rising he says uh smoke a little bit about it but what is your perspective on rising socio economic inequality increase housing education health care costs and its impact on the future of minority middle class groups your opinion and also they want to know how related to that how you feel about Bernie Bernie Sanders\nWell I think that let's deal with the first part in the rising income inequality and how it impacts minorities in the country remember as I was saying to you earlier you have for the first time in American society a sizable black middle class\nThis to me is a tremendous achieve and I think the two major achievements of the civil rights movement one is that economic stability but\nSecondly would be political voice [noise] um and we touched on that with my with Obama but also a record number of blacks and congressman uh like black mayors are right now you have the possibility of a black governor or in Florida in\nGeorgia to Maine Maryland right you know these are amazing yeah it is so I mean this is again part of the growth and I think you know I don't see how you hold back that wave of change that sleeping America\nIt's almost like Trump is happening up here but there's something else going on with women and with minorities electorally are across the country\nWell let's see I wouldn't I wouldn't exclude whites I think everybody catered whites I think people you know and it and after the failure of the Trump tax cuts yeah I think there are people who are working class whites who say you know I don't I don't see it I don't know what's going to again that plays into what's going on in the midterms but you asked about\nHow this impacts then the black middle class and well I think they didn't if you look at it the question is how I think the question that would come from the black community to any president is what are you doing to help that black middle class grow and in particular\nI think the question that would come from the black community to any president is what are you doing to help that black middle class grow and in particular\nIn particular to overcome the wealth gap so that even as you have a stronger black middle class than ever before they remains a tremendous differential in terms of the wealth in terms of people buying houses stock\nDividends property investments that attends a\nAttaches to the white community and its apps and in the black community so it's more the kind of paycheck to paycheck and people coming along slowly that is the big difference in what I didn't to reiterate Trump is taking away some of those government support ... that were put in place to encourage entrepreneurship to encourage\nOr the growth of that black middle class one other point on this this one from comes in and says he's going to drain the swamp he starts cutting government remember\nBush comes in Obama comes in and they are repositioning reforming government but at the same time you see small increments and government\nFor minorities\nDisproportionate share of minorities working for government state local but also federal government I think it's like thirty three percent more of a likelihood for minority in because a biased in the private sector difficulties\nIn private sector employment mhm so when he's whacking at this when he's freezing payments for government workers\nWhen he's taking away tax base from local and state government\nHe is impacting that black and Latino middle class in a very real way\nMhm mhm [noise] um this is another question during the Clarence Thomas\nI forgot one thing was about Bernie Sanders yeah how do you feel about Bernie thinking and again I think Sanders it's so interesting there's a real commonality if you look at the numbers between so many Trump voters and Sanders voters they're populous yeah and they want somewhat of a disruption in terms of American\nPolitics um but again the difference is that\nFor the Sanders voters base the government as having a role and they do not believe that simply by giving more to the rich\nThat you are going to solve these problems like Elizabeth Warren and the consumer financial protection born you know Trump comes in and he wants to do away with that in the argument that he would make is that since overregulation burdensome on business\nWarren and Sanders make the case no what we see is big business in fact exploiting mhm taking advantage of people who are hard working Americans of all colors um and I think that's where the divide comes between the Sanders\nAnd the Trump a voting base and but make no mistake about it there's populist energy that I think is rebelling against the idea of the establishment and especially the upper income establishment as looking out for themselves and their children's at the expense of the rest of the country", "show_name": "Commonwealth Club of California", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "31"}
