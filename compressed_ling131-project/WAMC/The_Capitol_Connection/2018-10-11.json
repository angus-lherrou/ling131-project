Y. S. U. T. dot org [noise]\nIt's the capital connection Hi I'm Alan jar talk joining us this week is New York state's Republican attorney general candidate came through for\nCurrently on leave of absence from the law firm ropes and gray and New York city he referred to is the managing partner of the firm's three hundred lawyer New York office focusing on bankruptcy and predators writes thrived and joining robes and gray\n... Ruben was a senior securitization analyst in the structured finance group at Moody's Corporation welcome keys who for\nWell thank you very much it's great to hear from you why would anybody in the world give up when you're giving up in order to run\nWell look it's really important for the state we're at a point where we really have to look at sharing some of our own problems internally and you know but the fact of the matter is you're not going to get that done if you have an insider trying to cure all because what we have is corruption\nThat's being driven by career politicians and you you need someone from the outside to come in and try to clean that up\nAnd look I I Do I get really because in this life I've I've had a very very lucky lucky sequence of events happen to be in this state and I really want to give something back I I grew up in Buffalo working class on the east side of town which is not a particularly nice part of buffalo\nAnd you know my dad worked at the plant at the Chevy flat and he worked very hard we were working class just trying to get ahead as a family and\nAs a result of my parents' hard work and doing little things that like taking me to the library on weekends and during the week we had a great public library downtown I was able to get a great education and so was my brother and I was able to go to Harvard on scholarship\nAnd that I was able to go to Harvard law school and come out and become a big time lawyer in New York City and I was able to realize my dreams because of the environment I had in my parents' hard work and some hard work on my own\nBut that's changed a lot and working class people have difficulties and and reaching those same aspirations and so having had that benefit in New York state where\nYou know we had a private sector that created jobs back in the seventies and eighties and you had a public sector that was not perfect but was much more of a sudden it is today you know I see those things having disappeared and I want to try to put it back the right way and so that's why I'm running the other thing is you you also need someone\nWho you know doesn't need the job you know part of the problem is why you know people in politics who are looking at running for another office\nHas to get along with the people around them have to make compromises and that's not consistent at all what what the people need which they need someone to get to the bottom of what's going on with their money\nAnd get to the bottom of what's going on with this corruption because the cost a bit of killing off and so look you know I I'm doing it because you know I'm someone who can do it in a way that that isn't compromised by needed to get along with the politicians\nNot compromised by the need to look the other way\nOkay and teach them when they call you that I Know that I was somewhat critical of your opponent to James in this race because she was the person that Cuomo frankly wanted to when she did perhaps that's why of all the Democrats and Republicans who are running\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nWho are fourteen points up behind in the last poll is you and it's because I think people have grave doubts about having somebody who is in the chicken coop if you're following me\nYeah love go oh that's what I've been hearing all over the state you know the same story over and over we've we've done this three times right we we've had three attorney general candidates who all claim that they were going to clean up corruption and\nEach of them has failed and doing it and one of the reasons I Believe they failed and one of the reasons a lot of voters believe they've been in sales is because you keep putting in career politicians or as I said have to get along with the other people\nTo not want your government to steal from you if not Democrat or Republican to one public services to be delivered honestly and effectively and so not withstanding you know some of the other things that are potentially going on out there\nWhat we're hearing around the state is that we're going to be in a position to win because we're the only viable alternative provides what the voters shaped\nOkay so you got Michael ... than running as the Green Party candidate\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd so I got to ask you this and I drew apologize in advance you're going to vote for Trump in twenty dream\nYou know I don't know what I'm going to do it twenty twenty we'll see we'll see what the record looks like you know we've had this phenomena out\nAnd many many presidential terms whether it was Obama whether even was Reagan where presidents and their first term do things and they're extraordinarily unpopular times during his first tour of him and then on the voters get to look back and\nSee the full entirety of the records you know they they take a step back and and they decide what they really want to do and in many cases you know that's a reelection and educationally and it's not you know and Bush one's case it was not so I'm gonna look back just like all the other voters in America and make a decision when we see the complete record\nNow what about the current attorney general's investigation into President Trump and\nThe Trump family you continue\nSo let's let's talk about this tax thing that came out I mean I I Know this is not a very ... politician thing to do to actually answer your question directly I'm going to do it I\nJust actually came out from the New York times last week you know the magnitude of it is huge um you know it goes back a lot of years um goes bad I think they said the one that the president was three long before I was born and\nYou know I don't know what if there's anything these accused of doing that and but obviously it goes on for decades as a a massive number of dollars that are implicated by it including state tax dollars and so you know look I I don't know whether it's true or false you know the New York times did they're digging but but it obviously marriage the full investigation\nAnd I would continue to investigate that are in fact I don't know if it's started yet I I hear were rumors state tax department they may be looking at things\nBut that's something of a magnitude that yeah you have to investigate it may you know my my view of all this stuff is that\n... the office was not supposed to be partisan you're supposed to apply the law\nAnd you're supposed to apply to everyone equally and fairly and you you know that that's something that I can place to do frankly that that my opponent can't credibly say\nYou know I I really they feel we need to follow the facts whether it leads to Donald Trump or Governor Cuomo Republicans Democrats you know critics local politicians what have you\nUm that's what you have to deal with the office because we have to restore the credibility of the state government and we have to restore the credibility of this office and we you know the way you do it is you stopped running this thing as a as a partisan vendetta machine um and you run it as something that works for the people and unbiased way\nSo we would let me ask you this you are of course African American and the greater Cheever you've done credible work in your life you're going to already you've done all of these things but there are those people who would say that Donald Trump you know had given signals of racism or his constituency how would you parse that for\nA look you know my feeling is that as an African American you develop particularly if you you try to achieve success and have some some success at achieving success that you've got to develop a pretty thick skin\nAnd so you know I I'm not a person who has a hair trigger and responding to real or perceived slight because if you if you let that stuff's distract you\nYou're not going to get very far in life because there's always stuff that's going to be distractions and there's always going to be stuff that you can attribute to racism um sometimes it is racism many times it's not and so you you you've got uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThe actual impact of it on you and what you're trying to accomplish versus you know than sort of the the psychological slight which made it very real but but it's not important too and in fact it's counterproductive to you're trying to get things done I mean I like I you know talked to a charge like I say to my kids look\nThere and I know a daughter was fourteen and the sun was eleven when they hear about a lot of this in the schools right about racism and identity politics and stuff I mean it's all over the schools and I said oh look you've got to focus on what you've gotta do\nTo accomplish the goals and not on what other people are thinking or saying we're doing and if someone's got some view that as counterproductive\nThat's not enough to stand on your way if you do the right things and so that's the way I've always live my life that's the way my parents told me to approach life\nAnd you know you know that's the way I look at you know a lot of the things that are that are said you know either privately or publicly that that I may or may not have an issue with I just look at you know down the road one of the things you have to do to move forward and I don't get distracted by you know a lot of the rhetoric\nAnd let's go to the environment and\nObviously than a run for attorney general of New York obviously New York like every other state in the country has to face the problems of the troubled environment where do you think\nI think we got to focus on our water at our water supply but there are there are a lot of issues that you know fly under the flag of environmental issues or air water endangered species endangered in sex you know I'm you know development issues wetlands issues a\nClimate change issues it it you know literally is almost everything on earth that falls under the rubric of the environment\nBut what I Want to prioritize as attorney general because I I I Do think it's something that's immediate and critical\nIs we've got to prioritize dealing with our water supply particularly our drinking water supply or where you have a great natural resource on the northern border the great lakes which twenty percent of the world's fresh water supply or at least that's not caught up in polar ice caps are and we have\nVery very fragile a article for is water supply downstate in Long Island and we have a history of\nBoth bad luck and and pollution and deliver it some of the accidental everywhere in between and so as attorney general one of the things I Would focus on is trying to deal with our water supply issues because obviously the the long term and short term public health damage that will be colossal\nMarijuana what do you think about that well I I think that medical marijuana has been shown at least initially to be something that's very beneficial you know under the supervision of doctors\nYou know you you've had instances where it's been a real palliative and helped to cancer patients who are undergoing incredible suffering and so I you know medical marijuana should be and should continue to be legal or in and we should\nI I think nationally naturally institutionalize that uh because that that avenue needs to be available to cancer patients and doctors ah with with tight supervision\nWhat about recreational what they're supposed to make recreational\nMarijuana I I'm not there yet because there are obviously there are a bunch of people who are pushing to try to legalize them to the extent that we're trying to deal with enforcing issues around communities of color I think we need to deal with those enforcement issues and make sure we're not ruining people's lives over low level offenses and putting them on a pastor\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nBut with the legalization of recreational marijuana there as a whole Pandora's box the problems that hasn't been discussed yet and we need to discuss those problems and deal with them before we make a decision\nOn it wouldn't matter example you're ... hold on where we we as DWI driving while you know high we don't even know how to detect it uh we have the\nLong term health care issues of marijuana used we don't really know what they are even though we have a Medicaid system that covers a huge percentage of New York's population so\nTo the extent we legalize recreational marijuana and there's a long term health impacts\nNot only is there going to be that human impact which is negative but we're also going to have to pay for that you know we also have to talk about drug testing we have a\nMultibillion dollar work than compensation issue do we want people not only driving while high but operating cranes of heavy equipment and you know drive you know potentially driving trucks\nYou know and all the workman's comp costs are going to come from that I mean one of my worries as if we legalize recreational marijuana because of our crazy litigation system in New York and the you know over zealous plaintiff lawyers were going to end up having employers feeling that they asked the mandatory drug test every part\nBecause they're not going to be able to credibly say that they didn't take steps not to have someone on the job was high at a critical moment\nAnd so when you look at all the costs you know turning back the clock\nOn you know intoxicated driving workers' compensation cost potential civil liberties infringements through\nYou know mandatory drug testing and you know the long term health care cost of doing this you know there's a lot of potential problems of legalizing marijuana that hasn't been studied and so I I'm just not there on a recreational basis\nOkay so here's my problem peaceful for now you have to promise as they come back and talk to us again I'm at a time I guess is the New York state Republican attorney general candidate ... thanks so much for joining us you are
