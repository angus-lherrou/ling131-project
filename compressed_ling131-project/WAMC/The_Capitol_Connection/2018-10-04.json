Y. S. U. T. dot org [noise]\nIt's the capital connection Hi I'm Ellen charge are joining us this week is somebody who I think the world of assembly member Deborah click a Democrat who represents New York sixty six assembly district in New York City\nA lifelong resident of the city she's lived in Greenwich Village for over forty years or ... to the city University of New York's queens college she received a masters of business administration degree from Fordham University welcome my friend Debra click\nThank you so much Alan it's great to have you with us to talk to you about this because you're name keeps coming up in the news [laughter] very interesting thing we've had since Nixon\nFor example who ran against Andrew Cuomo in the primary on this program many times in the past and then the working families party nominated her no we're not talking too much about this I can tell you\nThat there was some real division within the working families party\nThere were some of the ... the major labor leaders who had made whatever deals they made with Andrew Cuomo now not always but now they like them and they want to replace Cynthia Nixon on the working families party valid with Andrew Cuomo of course who I'm sure would rather not have anybody deciphering votes off from his total\nSo they've come up with what we could only call him a ... it's a New York city word a mature going to deal in which they're going to replace her with Cuomo on the working families Balad and the technique here is so interesting that I wouldn't even cry to get it right myself so you'll tell me right\nThere is a cork in the ... election law you cannot remove somebody from a ballot or after a certain period a\nUnless they die move out of the state\nUh or or a convicted of a crime and there is one other option and that is to place them on another line on the ballot in a different office and that is what\nA I Believe they are in the process of doing and Cynthia Nixon is might constituent which is very smart\nShe's lovely but I don't believe she actually wants to serve in the assembly this is a maneuver and yet it will result in my having a general election against Cynthia Nixon which was not what we had planned for this\nPeriod of time I was hoping to spend more of my time dealing with I'm getting a democratic state Senate or helping people running for Congress to flip\nThe house blue and a instead I'm going to have to focus at least some of my energy on ensuring that I'm reelected Cynthia did very well in my district\nOn the gubernatorial line and\nThere may be people who don't understand this maneuver and we just want to make certain that they understand that she is on the ballot but all the ... not an active and interested candidate and we are going to be trying to reach out to her campaign to get her help in making that clear to my constituents\nSo I have a question will Cynthia Nixon now go public and say hey\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOf and I don't want to be in the assembly will she said\nWell early in the year when they'll play soldier was placed on the ballot who they have now put up for a judgeship so it's sort of a double change which they do with the pitchers in baseball more will\nGo on the west side of Manhattan a double triple thick up right\nSo early on this became an issue locally and she said at that time in the papers that she's very supportive of me and she certainly wants to see me reelected working families party has written a letter to a local paper which they may or may not print\nAsserting their strong support for me and you know I'm I'm leaving nothing to chance so I'll be you know doing my own campaigning sending out mailers and a standing on street corners by the subway\nYou know my mom used to say to me so I used to say to me there's a good example of France giving away England colonies some [laughter]\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nStill exists a more so to the east and the west but you know escalating real estate\nAh prices have made it more challenging for small businesses we have a lot of empty storefronts and it's not just the rent it's\nThe way in which people shop now I'm online shopping is a challenge for small local shops they try to find a nice ... but it is hard and the escalating rents make that even more challenging\nBecause everyone is going to ask you about this just passed over something which is one of my great teams and that's the concept of the empty store\nNo that exist on the west side of this and the religion Broadway name id is not all about price point in other words greedy landlords who want to get more and more money out of those doors and so we've been big until they get what they want worse it's what you just mentioned that there are other considerations\nWell I think it's I think it's both and it's split certainly escalating rents are are a real problem and it's a problem in residential as well as commercial\nUh that is for certain but it's also the fact that a lot of young people have enormous\nA student loan debt or because of escalating tuition prices and that means you know we have a consumer economy and\nWhen people don't have disposable income these kids have a mortgage on their\nEducation they're not going to be able to get a mortgage on an apartment or house so it's changing what their choices are\nAnd it's also different uh in terms of what kind of jobs people have\nUm you know half of the young people are looking for jobs in tech or an advertising that's\nFocused more on a younger demographic and as a result they don't all have to buy suits and they don't all have to wear a dress up close and so the shops\nAre and stores that are selling that department stores are struggling just as much because people aren't necessarily driven to buy the same kinds of things and it's their idea of consumerism is a experiences so they want to go\nOut to eat and hang with their friends but they're not going to go to the mid range or higher priced restaurant uh so it's ... there's a lot of disruption in the economy\nAnd I'm sure this was true in another generation\nAh that face to different shift in the economic interests of people but it's it's very tough and empty storefronts create a sense of depression it's and it creates an unsafe streets escape\nOr let alone and an appealing visually a street scape\nA and that uh\nHas other consequences for uh so you know it's it we are in a very tough time and you know the attempt to say well let's just keep cutting\nTaxes well the result is our subway system is a is a mess or the streets need re paving and there isn't the same level of support schools are have higher numbers of students in classes then they should so the endless let's cut taxes\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNewsletters I'm about how what the taxes were\nThe fifties in the seventies the eighties and now and there is a trajectory a sharp trajectory down and yet we have these infrastructure problems we have these other\nUh overcrowded classrooms they are the result of people are thinking that you can do government on the cheap from ...\nI should say chairperson click because you reference just a few seconds ago you're the chair of the higher education committee we only have five minutes here but um but the city University of New York\nHas been having some problems some ethical problems and other things and you're in charge of oversight I'm a graduate of Hunter College ... to queens college we know with those universities are meant to us\nIs there a political elements these universities my my sense is that Governor Cuomo has put his paw mostly Sunni and Cooney operations and it's not going well\nWell I Would say that any government governor has always had an outsized influence on a Sunni they appoint everybody to the board or certainly um George Pataki appointed one of my colleagues Bob king\nAh who wasn't really an educator or a scientist or anything else\nAh so there's always been that the city university was a little less controlled by the governor in past years and this governors certainly has\nUm put people on the board including in my humble opinion inappropriately his budget director I don't think appointees by either a governor mayor should be people who work for them directly or I think that's a a conflict so um\nThat in some ways I think both of the systems because of rising a cost to pry the tuition have actually seen\nA major influx of students a long before there were a specialized scholarship program sure but we have gotten an incredible uh chancellor at SUNY or is this\nPast year or Christina Johnson is a um an electrical engineer with a distinguished background frankly I'm shocked that we're able to attract her\nFor this year was a no did you have the guts to say no to a movie as for something unreasonable\nI think she is smart enough to chart a course and convinced the governor or of the wisdom of that I'm OK that course\nOkay so you know the choices you put it couldn't come down to\nUh you can pay over sixty thousand dollars a year for NYU my where my PHD sixty thousand dollars a year teaching comprehensible and it's not the only one they're all up there now or how much does the city university Costa without the special programs\nI was I think the the I think now that the tuition is either sixty five hundred are sixty seven hundred or something in that range\nSo if you want to go to school when I went to under was free of course but if you want to go to school is a good deal\nIt's an excellent deal I'm even though it is a struggle but you know we have a great tuition assistance program for a poor and working poor students that helps dramatically a and many of those students are eligible for federal Pell Grants\nOr so I forget\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and

the friend the Shelley silver going to jail and we see corruption can you offer any insights into how that happens to somebody\nI Know it is mind boggling have some people who were seemingly very smart run into these kinds of trouble for one thing I Will say is electing more women there are seem to be a better chance of people understanding basic ethics\nI loved that so we are at a time our
