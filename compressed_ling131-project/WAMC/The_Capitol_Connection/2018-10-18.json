Y. S. U. T. dot org [noise]\nIt's the capital connection Hi I'm Alan charge talk joining us this week is Larry sharp libertarian candidate for governor\nVery sharp described himself as a businessman who started a trucking business and sold a successful distribution company\nA strategic consultant for thought leaders in government finance law technology media and healthcare a teacher and guest instructor who taught English management and business at universities such as Yale Columbia and John Jay college and a native New Yorker\nMarine Corps veteran husband to Georgia and father of two daughters Barbara and Josephine welcome Larry shop\nHow're you doing I'm Glad to be here\nOkay so Larry let me ask you first of all your the libertarian candidate running for governor so I Need to know true yes I got to be in the in political science I thought of John J. to love it but I'm not exactly sure what a libertarian is so maybe you can tell\nLibertarian as someone who believes that you should be as conservative or as liberal as you want to be as long as you are not trying to force yourself on others we understand that law is a very serious thing\nThat at the end of almost every laws that guy or gal with a gun who's going to put you in a cage if you don't want to go in a cage\nThat person is going to shoot you and that means you should be using all all what it really matters things like loss of life or freedom or property or health a threat to any of those things but we shouldn't be using all off or things like I don't like what you're doing or how you're acting or things of that sort\nSo give us the example ... gives examples of that of you know forcing yourself on somebody with specific examples of what we're doing wrong in this society\nThere's so many of them may be one that affects New York state directly the way we regulate hemp and candidates\nWe should be regulating ... and the candidates like onions why if we do it like onions we will help us small farmers in this state our small farmers would love to have another cash crop to sell and to grow and to create craft grows we're not doing that we're deciding that had been cannabis as bad because you don't like people doing it\nThat is exactly the wrong reason it hurts our small farmers not just that it hurts small businesses not just that it does what they used to come back to the shake do cool things of that crap grows and and had creek hemp plastic and ... closet heavy rope not just that it hurts the average the Yorker\nWho asked chronic pain who now is getting stuck with added opioid or not even that\nAnd now they have to either a you know take some of that and they get addicted to or\nHave their family and friends go off and try to buy it and maybe go to jail why in the world but we let someone use of cannabis product and have a better life we didn't do that for those people who have chronic pain but not just that those people who are addicted there are people who are addicted to heart horrible drugs\nThat could use a cannabis product to get them off of those drugs that can be done so that's a good example that affects the Yorker's right now\nCould use a cannabis product to get them off of those drugs that can be done so that's a good example that affects New Yorkers right now\nGovernor Cuomo's for that nobody not okay go ahead\nNo Governor Cuomo is about let's make sure that we heavily regulate heavily tax medical marijuana only so that his cronies can survive and do well so big business wins and small business small farmers lose\nI said like onions with one exception obviously you to be Eighteen years old at the purchase it I Want the small farm it to be able to grow it\nI don't have to wait for years to get a license and a hope that his majesty king Andrew what happens to be nice enough to give him a license and they have to pay two hundred thousand dollars to get that license no if you want to grow grow I Want to help small but it's the small farmers not the big business\nWho the cronies you just referencing do you think I Know all of his cronies well no but give us a sort of ... ...\nEvery single person who has a bit license right now every single person who has a hemp a license to grow hemp right now every person in a kind of a school right now those histories\nWhat about the guys who were being arrested you know who have been convicted the people around him and his closest aides or you know those cronies\nOf course that's what they into all the boards at all the authorities are for ... one of the other problems which is different from what you mentioned earlier\nBut the idea of corruption there are several ways to repair and make corruption a whole lot less in the state you can't get rid of corruption nobody can but you absolutely can make it less and you absolutely kept earlier here's a when they do get rid of all these unaccountable boards authorities corporations like\nLet's see do any of those things that worries instead go to a trade school to be a trade school become a plumber a technician eight track guy mechanic whatever you want to do all good\nTwo years of that depending on what you do need a license at Eighteen or are you ready for the partnership whatever the case may be go off and do that and be happy you don't like that great go get a job\nGo work go get a job\nGo work if the work ethic burned out when your boss show up at eight you show up at eight not at nine thirty resident actually mean seven forty five get that work ethic\nI don't know how many people tell me all the time Larry I Would hire anybody with a work ethic why start a business they might say wait a minute they're sixteen are you kidding me no I'm dead serious we have a whole situation right now where if you ask twenty year olds if they feel like adults over half will tell you know\nThat's bad I Can't change parenting but I could change the environment I Want us to be making those mistakes at sixteen not twenty six now they are a lot of twenty six year olds coming back home to mom and dad they can mistakes let's make those mistakes at sixteen\nLearn lessons get better by the time what twenty six we can rock and roll the next question I get it how do you pay for their words I was ... when I got a Marine Corps I got the GI Bill GI Bill gave me the money and there's so many years to spend with the same thing with a six year old they get twenty thousand dollars\nThey can use it and we'll we'll set it off to school they want they have seven years to use twenty thousand dollars seven years when that happens here is where I promise you never want there'll be a bunch of prep schools that will pop up I guess how much their costs for two years twenty thousand dollars there'll be a bunch of a trade school for the pop up and they'll cost twenty thousand dollars how do I know that\nBecause it's guaranteed money from the government and banks love that they will give loans this will pop up this will happen everywhere Chanel what am I saying I'm saying for those tend to lead the greatest now instead of paying twenty two thousand dollars per year were paying ten thousand dollars per year we're saving twelve thousand dollars per kid but not just that\nIt's about four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders do the math that's over four billion dollars which means we said we we make up\nThat federal funds right away still have no strings attached a lot of teachers that teach get rid of a bunch of administrators have better results for kids happier kids happier parents happier teachers\nNow on a new way way what is your question are you are there are those people who think that our educational system is still after all these years segregated a you know the black kids get less than anyone can do what do you do about that\nYeah absolutely hundred percent the first thing is if you notice my whole plan and the ... the twelfth grade\nYou can go to school you want to go to so kids will pick schools so you'll find that kids will begin to integrate naturally that will tend to happen if you can pick the school you want to go to now will that be perfect but of course not we're not going to have the fifty that's not happening\nBut we'll integrate better yes you will have better integration if the parents can pick any school the kids can pick any school and it's based upon dollars that everybody gets so you will have naturally more integration ... eleventh and twelfth grade that part is built in\nNow before this was quick yeah this is a big deal most of this goes to reward schools now because the charter schools that sort I would've changed how we actually even pay for the schools\nFirst things first right now as I said we're paying about twenty two thousand dollars per kid I'd have to pay a whole lot less I think we can go to the idea is I talked about I Would like to state ... state has to pay by a constitution\nFor grades one through twelve that's required and I get that will do that but I don't want to be paid at all by local communities I don't want\nAny school tax at the local level now that sounds crazy I Know but if you start to do that everything's comes it's ...\nBut I don't want to be paid at all by local communities I don't want any school tax at the local level now that sounds crazy I Know but if you start to do that everything's ... state the state will play pay a flat fee to all school districts a flat fee to all school districts you have X. amount of kids\nMultiply that by a number I'm not sure what that number it's exactly yet my gut tells me about Fifteen K but I'm not sure yet here's your back good luck\nNo more grant writing no more begging money from the state they're more Becky money from the federal government here is your money good luck the number of ... that you\nGot it but what if the administrators in that district or you know for one of a better word or you know jerks and decide okay this one group we when we favor one group we don't favor because on them if they rule group and you say well it's been in any way you want\nAbsolutely here's the issue the only thing that requires transparency that is my only issue you must be transparent any bad behavior whether that is racial or gender or sexual orientation or religious any of that whatever that might happen I Will shine a light on I Will that everyone know what is happening\nOkay you're young and it's not like they're not like that but what have you gotten so and it's like to your show and you know you got a group of people who get themselves elected and they want the or religious kids to be treated in different ways and didn't want to hold the same standard that's okay\nI didn't say it was okay when I literally said was any bad behavior I Will shine a light\nOkay so there is a lightning so there is like being shined on those guys I read about it all the time but it hasn't changed their bad behavior\nKnow that there isn't a shine for there's a shine a light shining or from the government from the governor that's number one and that that's the first day and they still are able to do whatever they want\nBecause the average person doesn't know the local people now but the local people aren't enough the whole state you know someone's going to shine a light on that behavior so it was going to come on TV like I Will and say look at what's happening in this community you start shining a light on that and you will see action being taken\nYeah because they want but but but Larry and they want to what they want the boats Andrew Cuomo wants to vote so you don't hear too much from Andrew Cuomo about it a lot of them and I don't care about\nThose votes yes you're correct he does that's not me I asked you have balls and ethics I care about that that's I'm not him okay I Will turn on and I'm telling you right now on radio I'm telling you I Will shine a light on all of\nThe game okay Larry we've got three minutes left I got to ask you real quickly in the real lightning round health care\nThe health care and health insurance or not the same thing this is our biggest problem we've confused them and we worry about fixing health care\nInsurance when we should be worried about fixing health care we have to fix health care first the biggest piece is transparency is making it no longer a cartel system make it no longer so hard to put people in the actual feel itself we fix health care first then we can fix health care shorts\nOK the MTA MTA's an absolute disaster the Paris summit\nSixteen billion dollars of that about six billion comes straight from New York state goes right to them because they're bad have to fix it three ways sway number one we have to start using on infrastructure raising money through that through marketing at least gotten any rights they writes the bridges and tunnels that were raised billions of dollars to help support\nThe actor empty a second you have to use it that the lines right now at night that aren't being used the rail lines in the city had freight line to use those freight lines to raise money both for marketing purposes and for bringing Frank to the city less wear and tear on the city less wearing short infrastructure more money coming in\nNext the empty as a board has to completely change because no one is accountable the boy has to go away with people and put people on who are accountable to the local people in addition\nYou have to copy all of the good ways that people are doing this and other laws\nWho are accountable to the local people in addition you have to copy all of the good ways that people are doing this and other\nLarge cities in the world those pictures like Berlin and London and copy the ideas are working because the empty chair so an efficient to fix one mile of track they are four times more expensive than other cities in this world that both have unions and have safety copy that global save money and raise money ways other than more taxes will make it more efficient\nOkay tax reform biggest thing a tax reform as getting rid of unfunded mandate unfunded mandate to the county level crushing local counties or you can talk about that if you start getting rave unfunded mandate you will find counties lot less desire to raise property taxes uh\nProperty taxes we have a problem with that you property taxes right now we're not voted on by the actual people in the town there voted on by the legislators which we then go behind closed doors and race\nPocket tax okay well I Would hold on hold on because we're running out of time to really seriously um what examples can usually have a tax reform yes I'm ... I'm Sorry\nOkay fed up would you examples can you give us unfunded mandate that you would you do with\nI Would do it but none of them I Would I Do it I Would not do away with them what I Would say is they're not required let the county's decide what they want to deal with I Would let county start their budget at zero that's what I Would do I don't have to know all these things that's the point my entire campaign is about decentralization here's what I Know from business from family from life\nIf you ask personal freedom plots accountability plus transparency you will have innovation right now are saying is it a death spiral over a hundred thousand people living every year and a rise of suicides drop all different parts of our state so that has to change which means many innovation I'm going to foster innovation that's what I'm trying to achieve\nIt's always great to have somebody who speaks a little bit of a different language than others and Larry sharp as a libertarian gubernatorial candidate against Andrew Cuomo and the millions of other people Larry we wish you well and we hope that new come back and talk to us in the future\nThank you for having ... Larry shop dot com and as far short with an e and the essential for electable\nOr enough I like that you great to talk to you Larry thanks so am I have a goal but [noise]\n\nThe capital connection is distributed with the cooperation of the public radio stations of New York's thing David ... is the producer of the capital connection a production of WAMC Northeast Public radio in Albany support for the capital connection comes from New York state United teachers representing professionals in education and healthcare\nOnline and then why ask UT dot org\n[noise]\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Capitol Connection", "city": "Albany", "day": "18"}
