I think the reality is it's rampant there have been fifty state officials have been forced to resign urban indicted uh since uh two thousand\nPretty much the entire leadership of the state assembly in the Senate probably want it to his actions or had been convicted in ... and reaching Europe and the guys are like that but not on the\nBasis of all the chicanery you're talking about in other words these guys Shelley silver and the skill as they were convicted for other things\nVery convicted of political corruption yes that ... taken different type of you know kick back yet you know a lot of things that we would have found a legal or outrageous prior to Watergate are now in shrine in the law\nAnd an old friend of mine are Louis used to run around and say what is a campaign contribution and he would spell out you know bribery just become a legal form a bribery and I think the controller you know needs to be mindful of that when he's at you know doing the audits why shouldn't said what is a pre approval\nOf these contractors the ass additional questions when you see the some of these make campaign contribution\nThat we're talking to mark suddenly the Green Party candidate for New York state controller okay so mark you or a guy who has always been very concerned you and your wonderful wife due to think who was a a great friend of the stations have talked a lot about the environment so what can the controller actually do to help us with the environment\nWell as I said I mean the one thing we've been pushing for as you get the state to divest from fossil fuels which we've talked about an interesting thing I recently met\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no choke ... dog harness invented to make it easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand sex\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nAnd the construction of the offshore wind industry I said well that's very interesting because we love to see New York state do that literally the aerial off of a Long Island in New York City is considered the Saudi Arabia of of war Sherwin ... let me get a district the\nParty or you are for the construction of these offshore\nWind mills yes very strongly in favor I'm\nActually one of our party ... met a couple of years ago with Governor Cuomo and explain to him because he was concerned at that point that wind turbines might be too close to the land and it would be scenic stuff and she said no no no we're building them now ten twelve miles out and he turned debates let's say goes who's in the room and said\nIt's a Green Party right we build a number that far out in their right you know maybe we should do more of them then they're going to be that far out\nSo you know we are trying for a hundred percent by twenty thirty based on this report Mark Jacobson did on vision clean energy but twenty thirty\nAnd in that report forty percent of the energy in the state would confirm or sure when I think ten percent from onshore wind and then about thirty seven percent from solar I Do think one of the problems we have a new state right now is almost impossible to cite utility scale renewables and I think one of the ways that\nIt's okay look on out there on fire island right place I Love and drove us\nI'm looking out into the ocean I don't see those windmills doing All right we haven't had the offshore wind fight yeah because you haven't done any we're just about ... onshore wind right okay theoretically I'm looking at in the ocean offshore I Would not see them\nCorrect okay well you might see a little blimp if you had to binoculars uh-huh but if they're you know three hundred feet high but the ... ten miles out your eyesight might be better than a mind you might catch 'em out here but but ... is going to be hardly noticeable\nI'm One of the things we have said is why not have the state you know we're a bunch of echo socialist one out of the state do public ownership of some of these are things we have fifty\nSeven fifty eight public utilities right now in your state including green island and just say to these towns and cities you\nIf you want the economic development from renewable\nEnergy we will bring it to your community you have to do is you have to cite it\nSo you decide where you want it and then invite us and we'll constructed because what happens is the developers run around and they look for the nice flat piece of land\nThat they can easily develop which is usually really good farmland and then that leads to people object to it but if this town was involved with the village and said we want to build a couple of winter vans or wind farm in town where do people want it then they can find that out locally\nFigure out what's the best place and then have somebody come in and finance\nOkay no more kindly Green Party candidate a for a controller what are your platform things is to do a state carbon tax what's that\nWell as the carbon tax you know we propose actually we have legislation I drafted three years ago it was in the number Kevin K hill has been the lead sponsor you should be chair of the assembly energy committee so uh it starts off at about I think forty dollars a time maybe thirty five dollars a ton and increase his Fifteen dollars a year\nOr the idea is that those were emitting greenhouse gases carbon emissions and to contribute to climate change should have to pay for the damage that they are causing and then the debate tends to be over ... what do you do with the revenues we rebate sixty percent of ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no choke ... dog harness invented to make it easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand sex\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nAnd renewable energy mass transit and other things that contribute to climate change surprisingly well a majority of Americans support a carbon task surprisingly a majority of Republicans in previous suppose I think is now forty nine percent among Republicans they supported if the revenue is used to pay for renewable energy\nUm they have less support if the revenue is a hundred percent rebate it does actually surprising to me that the Republican support a carbon tax if the money goes towards\nA renewable energy but the idea behind a carbon tax is that if you actually made\nThose who burned fossil fuels reflect the cost to society and the price that will make renewable energy cheaper comparatively and celebrate the transition I mean already renewable energies becoming cheaper\nThan in fossil fuels even natural gas but you know you increase that price difference to market takes over and and drives the a transition to renewable energy\nOkay no marked on me oh ... minutes left and I got a lot of questions I Want to ask you so keep him short OK okay let's talk about the N word marijuana or the legalization of marijuana in New York where do you think\nWe've I advocated for the legalization for decades or actually when I was a ... a because we're having students arrested in Syracuse N.Y Kurd has to war to decriminalize the small possession of marijuana forty years ago and yet somehow New York state particularly New York city is a marijuana arrests capital of the world\nOr I don't know how we allow the police to violate the law we passed forty years ago and we should you know tax it regulate it like we do alcohol and use the revenues and support education or you know we don't want kids using it you don't want people use when they're\nDriving or operating equipment or things that have stopped at\nA I don't know if you do stop it obviously you criminalize it when they do to that uh but I think education and you know\nI grew up with the idea that for instance that you would drink and drive it just something that always terrified me the idea but I Would get behind the car and cause an accident that would harm something just not something I'll even go close to", "show_name": "The Capitol Connection", "year":
