movement\nApply for almost everything these are the real heroes to people were helping me do this\nOn come on now you mean to say you can't give me one mentally hero one person like you know in the body and the Libertarian Party ramble\nAnd yeah I Love OK Rand Paul's libertarian Rand Paul's Republican to just be clear on that lots of Republicans call themselves which areas\nBut the Republicans he's Republican not libertarian you want me to give you a hero yeah Gary Johnson the man who stood up twice to try to stand up for this party and lost both times but it's still going strong that's my hero a good man a man who cares about people and they had those who do have the right thing that's my hero\nAnd remind us who use again did you just say that you know I said you know there are a lot of people out there are no idea who represent twenty six to eight yeah and actually it and you'd\nThink if we took a poll more than ten percent with no ...\nDid you ask me for someone famous or did you ask me for a hero\nOr heroine no no no you said you really said that I was explaining to you why I say because I Want yeah you're a hero to be introduced everybody's than they would know who he was\nI Love it please Google Gary Johnson that'd be amazing\nOkay that sounds a little condescending but that's okay you can do that if you like so now your website U.S policy issues listed one of them I Do one of them and first on the list that I saw was education telling some young when you're libertarian approach to education would be\nYes uh this is that right what a total re boot of education is just the right now we're dropping twenty two thousand dollars per person per year per kid I should say per year and the state\nTen thousand more than the average and we're at best rank thirty seven and be in the entire nation we also have massive teacher burn out and then we have trouble even finding of teachers we have a lot of problems that are sitting in a situation right now is low graduation rates nothing but bad so here's the answer number one is the larger answer but I'll give you the whole thing\nThe first thing is and standardized testing until high school satellites testing before high school just makes is unfair where reading teachers as an unfair way of rewarding schools it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid if they can't test well it makes a second class of students\nIn elementary school it's a terrible idea let's do it in the case of the success that age that should go away\nIf that goes away several things will happen number one will lose Common Core good don't care if it goes away that teachers decide if it makes sense or not\nThat's not my choice that should be a teacher's choice to use that tool or not second will lose federal funding will lose about four billion dollars out of the budget it's about sixty billion dollars total an education budget\nAnd about four billion of that comes to the federal government we will lose that keep that number and your head place because I Would say I would do without the second\nThere's something else that we lose that will get is that for a million dollars you lose all those strings attached which is amazing which means we can start getting rid of some administrators the average teacher in New York state makes about eighty thousand dollars is an average the average administration makes over a hundred thousand\nIf we can get rid of two or three administrators at any given district we can easily get these raises or hire more teachers or get well computers or whatever so quieter in that district it would provide a surplus in that\nDistrict just getting getting rid of administrators in addition if you ask most teachers why they leave it at men it's that's the regulation that's why they leave they get burned out we actually have school districts now that have more administrators and teachers in them that shame but we should not have that but I'm Still not done not just uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nNot the right answer the last ... aren't doing well how do we know that because if you go to the first year of college for too many college students\nIt has to become thirteenth grade why 'cause they're not ready for college now of course but also happens now it takes them at least six years to graduate college that's the norm now at least six years if not more if they even graduate history low college graduation rates also so I got twenty four year old kid\nWho never had a job and he has the work ethic and we wonder why or worse at twenty four year old kid who's a hundred thousand dollars in debt\nHas a degree that does not have any real value and obviously working Starbucks\nLose lose lose now do you also have a lot we ... we do have ... the problem with that is the image is horrible people say things like you're better than ... or ... for the dumb kids are posted his for the bad kids\nTerrible that we say that it's completely wrong and we should be supporting schools like like the ... programs and they don't ... raids would eat we desperately straight we need tradesmen in this state the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty\nThat's bad I let my ... year old I'm fifty but we need more people to be in the trades need the average to be thirty thirty five now a rock and roll it we should change that I Would change that wants to get a sixteen he or she takes the test they pass the test to get a high school diploma\nThan they have five options option number one you think colleges right interview\nAwesome go to a prep school go to prep schools are you ready for that college with a history or biology or liberal arts or whatever it is go off do that\nWhen you didn't have to that college you are ready to rock and roll maybe graduate in three years take advantage of ... to take advantage of internships you get a good college experience a fast ... red rock and roll but let's say you're not that good your so super smart that you'd be bored in that you'd be totally bored no worries take your expertise now\nGetting associates degree you're not smart kid there'll be bored go do it\nAwesome do you mean scientists anyway good luck [noise]\nLet's see do any of those things that worries instead go to a trade school to be a trade school become a plumber a technician eight track guy mechanic whatever you want to do all good\nTwo years of that depending on what you do you either have a license to Eighteen or you're ready for the partnership whatever the case may be go off and do that and be happy you don't like that great go get a job go work go get a job\nGo work if the work ethic burned out when your boss show up at eight you show up at eight not at nine thirty resident actually mean seven forty five get that work ethic\nI don't know how many people tell me all the time Larry I Would hire anybody with a work ethic why start a business they might say wait a minute they're sixteen are you kidding me no I'm dead serious we have a whole situation right now where if you ask twenty year olds if they feel like adults over half will tell you know\nThat's bad I Can't change parenting but I can change your arm it I Want us to be making those mistakes at sixteen not twenty six now they are a lot of twenty six year olds coming back home to mom and dad making mistakes let's make those mistakes at sixteen\nLearn lessons get better by the time with twenty six we can rock and roll the next question I get it how do you pay for their words I was ... when I got a Marine Corps I got the GI Bill GI Bill gave me some amount of money and there's so many years to spend it with the same thing with a six year old\nThey get twenty thousand dollars they can use it and we'll we'll set it off to school they won't have seven years to use twenty thousand dollars Seventy years when that happens here is where I promise you number one there'll be a bunch of prep schools that will pop up I guess how much their costs for two years twenty thousand dollars there'll be a bunch of a trade school for the pop up\nAnd they'll cost twenty thousand dollars how do I know that because this guy\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nHere we're saving twelve thousand dollars per kid but not just that it's about four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders do the math that's over four billion dollars which means we said we we make up\nThat federal funds right away still have no strings attached allow teachers to teach get rid of a bunch of administrators have better results for kids happier kids happier parents happier teachers\nKnow want to do more in a way I Want to ask you a question are you are but there are those people who think that our educational system is still after all these years segregated a you know the black kids get less than minimum wage can do what do you do about that\nYeah absolutely a hundred percent the first thing is if you notice my whole plan ... and the er the twelfth grade\nYou can go to school you want to go to so kids will pick schools\nSo you'll find that kids will begin to integrate naturally that would tend to happen if you can pick the school you want to go to now whether it be perfect but of course we're never gonna have to be fifty just that's not fat but we'll integrate better\nYes you will have better integration if the parents can pick any school the kids can pick any school that is based upon dollars that everybody gets so you will have naturally more integration eleventh and twelfth grade that part is built in\nNow before all of this was quick yeah this is a big deal most of this goes to how we reward schools and I'll be great charter schools there that sort I Want to change how we actually even pay for the schools\nFirst things first right now as I said we're paying about twenty two thousand dollars per kid I'd have to pay a whole lot less I think we can go to the ideas I talked about I Would like to state ... state has to pay by a constitution\nFor grades one through twelve that's required and I get that will do that but I don't want to be paid at all by local communities I don't want\nAny school tax at the local level now that sounds crazy I Know but if we start to do that everything's comes in the state the state will play pay a flat fee to all school districts a flat fee to all school districts you have X amount of kids\nMultiply that by a number I'm not sure what that number is exactly yet my gut tells me about Fifteen K but I'm not sure yet here's your back good luck\nNo more grant writing no more begging money from the state no more Becky money from the federal government here is your money could lock the number of kill ya that you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Capitol Connection", "city": "Albany", "day": "20"}
