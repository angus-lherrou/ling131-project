the law school and he's been a long time executive director of hunger Action Network of New York state\nMark has also written a book Madame president the unauthorized biography of the first Green Party president welcome mug done me well thank you Alan glad to be on WAMC okay so I guess the first question which I'm going to ask do\nAnd you're not going to tell me the truth about but I'm going to ask him can you in\nProbably not this is not a race designed to well depends how you define when I Do find when as if I can convince Tom to Napoli the present state controller\nWho's twenty five points ahead in the poll or something to divest the state pension fund from fossil fuels uh I've been coordinate in that campaign for the last five years or three fifty dot org managed to get earlier this year in New York City degree to divest\nA managed to get one thousand institutions worldwide was seven point two trillion dollars to divest from fossil fuels\nBut have not been able to manage to convince time to Napoli who actually has become a national spokesperson for the fossil fuel industry or with respect to his opposition to the vestments so I thought this would be a good opportunity um but I also haven't worked for many years but who the fiscal policy Institute\nAnd with the state budget or also very concerned about some of the fiscal transparency and accountability issues\nMugged on me and that's an interesting point I've asked Tom the Napoli about this many times\nHis response has always been my job is controller is to bring the best return on our investments as I possibly can\nAnd it is not to make political statements like that but I think frankly I got to be honest with you I think you're being a little unfair to say he's a national spokesman for the fossil fuel industry well\nThey they profile them these days in their annual report as being responsible boys but I Am very concerned about the fiscal question besides I think it's morally wrong for the state to continue to invest in an industry which is ... you know contributing to the destruction of planet\nTom ... who you may remember it was the act in state controller between when she was forced to resign and eat legislature pointed to Napoli there's\nBeen quite outspoken about the need to divest wildly fossil fuels still has some value he points out for the last four or five years\nOr these fossil fuels have been the worst performing sector of the stock market and in fact a new report out a couple of weeks ago a by an investment firm showed that if New York state had vested ten years ago the

advocacy we have a fifty year history of that never really been effective and since I been involved in a campaign I've discovered\nThat not only are the shareholder resolutions only advisory they cannot actually deal with the core part of the business so you can pass a resolution to increase the number of women on the board of directors which is good but you cannot even introduce a resolution shady keep eighty percent of the fossil fuels in the ground\nMark I wanted to ask you about this New York state finances New York is deeply in debt potentially Seventeen point nine billion dollars now it is true that I've had reservations about the gubernatorial actions of of a president governor\nIn New York actually I live in Massachusetts but of Andrew Cuomo and it seems to me he's very good and now seeing huge projects and they're going to cost a lot of money but I think it's fair to say he won't be around when we have to pay off the bills\nNo need to pull no need to Todd walk your dog with love thousands every means at my dog current S. dot com\nBubble I'm One of the things we have said is why not have the state you know we're a bunch of echo socialists one out of the state do public ownership of some of these are things we have fifty\nSeven fifty eight public utilities right now in your state including green island and just say to these towns and cities you\nIf you want the economic development\nFrom renewable energy we will bring it to your community you have to do is you have to cite it\nSo you decide where you want it and then invite us and we'll constructed because what happens is the developers run around and they looked at the nice flat piece of land\nThat they can easily develop which is usually really good farmland and that leads to people object to it but if this town was involved with the village and said we want to build a couple of winter vans or wind farm in town where do people want it then they can fight that out locally\nFigure out what's the best place and then have somebody come in and finance\nOkay no more deadly Green Party candidate a for a controller what are your platform things is to do a state carbon tax what's that\nWell a snake carbon taxes you know we propose actually we have legislation I drafted three years ago it was in the number Kevin K hill has been the lead sponsor you should be chair of the assembly energy committee so it starts off at about I think forty dollars a time maybe thirty five dollars a ton and increase just Fifteen dollars a year\nOr the idea is that those were emitting greenhouse gases carbon emissions at a contributor to climate change\nShould have to pay for the damage that they are causing and then the debate tends to be over what do you do with the revenues we rebate sixty percent of the revenues to low and moderate income people to try to hold them harmless because energy ... tend to be regrets of the ... people and then the last forty percent\nWe or invest in renewable energy mass transit and other things that contribute to climate change surprisingly well\nA majority of Americans supported carbon cast surprisingly a majority of Republicans in previous both I think it's now forty nine percent among Republicans they supported if the revenue is used to pay for renewable energy\nUm they have less support if the revenue is a hundred percent rebate it does actually surprising to me that the Republican support a carbon tax if the money goes towards a renewable energy but the idea behind a carbon tax is that if you actually made\nWho burned fossil fuels reflect the cost to society and the price that will make renewable energy cheaper comparatively and celebrate the transition I mean already renewable energies becoming cheaper\nThan in fossil fuels even natural gas but you know increased that price difference the market takes over and and drives the a transition to renewable energy\nOkay no marked on me only seven minutes left and I got a lot of questions asking so keep him short OK okay let's talk about the N word marijuana or the legalization of marijuana in New York what do you think\nWe've advocated for the legalization for decades or actually when I was a ... a because we're having students arrested in Syracuse N.Y Kurd past the war to decriminalize the small possession of marijuana\nForty years ago and yet somehow new ...

I'm sure that commercial banks are all for this idea\nWell that's why we you know we don't have it um because we're basically trying to take their profits away but for instance who would help um local governments because they could then save the school district with a local government that they have to go borrow money they could borrow from the bank and probably have a couple of interest one job believe\nIt or not I'm actually fiscally conservative when it comes to high taxes I'm probably the only former elected official who can say that every year I was in government\nOr I managed to cut taxes I don't know anybody else who says that and speaking of corruption\nOr one of the things I did was I put the town insurance contract out forbid in that town was hosting kill suddenly everybody's screaming long story the a county democratic cheer went to federal prison for two years for being an unnamed co insure on our town insurance contracting and also on the rents are counting insurance contract\nInteresting okay so of course being a green and being a progressive you on a single payer health care law is a way to do that in just New York\nYes um I actually cofounded single pair of New York and I personally take credit for revitalizing the single parent movement or in your state when I was with hunger Action Network a\nConvince a Dick are afraid to charity somebody health committee has been an advocate for decades that in fact it was a base of support and you should try again and we now passed it three or four years in a row would it be better than it would have said that ... and the assembly yes not in not in the Senate though almost a majority of the senators had been a co sponsored the bill of never been able to get a vote\nAnd but if this year the Senate goes democratic and think that there's a chance that you'll see you're you're a bill finally or or the other guys in the assembly who have always said they were forward to the usual thing take tail and run\nI share some of your cynicism 'cause we saw that in California every year when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nBubble has said he supports single payer healthcare though we referred at the national level you know I don't think we're getting hit with Trump is president take one minute on immigration\nI'm we support uh you know the right of immigrants we support a\nA you know the dream act you know there should be a pathway to citizenship we support Albany being a sanctuary city you know I Lived in New York City for the last ... years\nAnd it is an immigrant city in at your co workers at the people who you're me to businesses ... you know New York state in particular is an immigrant state revenue sharing oh\nI used to port restoring section fifty for the state finance law which requires ... percent of a state revenues to go to local governments I've worked with that when I was on my down board right now is zero point four years and I would repeal detach gap which is a\nBumper sticker which has done nothing is just go on those two percent tax cuts right which the controllers responsible for monitoring compliance with so I think\nThe Knicks controller just stand up and say this is not working\nRevenue sharing would if you want to tie it into we increase revenue sharing you have to decrease your local property taxes by a certain percentage or that's fine\nRockefeller started the revenue sharing because you realize that communities have only the property taxes she'll stash to raise revenue that impact upon lower and moderate income people the state has a bigger way to raise revenues we are at a time it's unfortunate\nBecause mark done me has a lot to say he's the Green Party candidate for New York state controller more thanks so much for joining us well thank you\n\n\n\nThe capital connection is distributed with the cooperation of the public radio stations of New York state David ... who's the producer of the capital connection a production of WAMC Northeast Public radio in Albany support for the capital connection comes from New York state United teachers represented professional dumb education and health care\nLaw did NY S.
