{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "Um it's not all the level of his accomplishments for which uh I think he outlined very clearly but rather the way\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHave a beer with him obviously we've learned that beer is more dangerous than I ever knew [laughter] um so you know the likeability of somebody a becomes an issue when in fact the competence and\nAh their capacity for doing the job probably should be the first marker of whether one support someone or not\nI Will just say that it was interesting to me that in my district or there was Seventy six registered working families party people\nAre five of whom showed up for the working families party primary [noise] so that's kind of a bitter pill a or a bitter coda to the whole nother story that they count on obviously Democrats\nOr an independence or not on their own registered voters\nJust so everybody understands this is you just mentioned that they\nNeed fifty thousand votes to stay on the ballot basically in the next time and they have to win in the gubernatorial election so certainly in democratic who qualify for the Republicans will qualify and I think would Cynthia Nixon there that would be their best bet to qualifying for those fifty thousand votes don't you\nI Believe that a democratic voters will be smart a and there are you know obviously a I'm a self interested party in this matter\nSo obviously it would be easier in my life is the she stayed on the working families party line I don't think it would affect the outcome of the old gubernatorial election uh and I think that\nThe working families party would see that a reasonable vote that would keep them in\nBusiness so to speak on the other hand you know there are people who say let's leave nothing to chance and I think they\nCould have Andrew Cuomo turnaround have the line and then they don't vote for me on the working families party line\nYou know he doesn't like the very much because he's always been an adversary using the bully\nI think he has\nAn aggressive style that um is single minded towards his whatever he sees as the uh end result\nAnd a clearly there are times when I'm that comes across as I'm tough guy and I think he likes that persona ... you know when you know these are the the muscle car guy\nAnd I have to say when there's an emergency that persona where there's a natural disaster or whatever that persona is actually a positive thing\nOr it's not necessarily as positive when there are delicate negotiations\nOkay so ... tell us a little bit about your stumping around ... the place that historically first had the boss is like ... ... from a liberal into a less liberal um person\nAnd what is the tenor of the politics of of ah Greenwich Village now\nWell let me be clear I represent the village from east to west\nSo it includes ah East Village as well as central and West Village all of which have separate identity as well as no whoa so try Becca and civic center so it's and Battery Park north I don't want to insult my uh\nConstituents in Battery Park city north um I think that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nPeople's identities are very much tied to the twenty square blocks in which they circulate so the ... of the East Village is very different from that of the west village but I think that the politics are I'm liberal too progressive\nWe have a lot of uh old time residents longtime residents I'm One of those\nWe have a lot of new people people are attracted to the culture the creativity we have a lot of a small theater is it's you know mid town as the Broadway theater we have a lot of off Broadway and off off Broadway\nWe have a lot of small museums a cultural events\nOf those things are wide attract people there's we're losing our ... our Aaron light by having more vertical development but\nIn comparison to other parts of Manhattan we are low rise mixed use a and people like that sense of walking damned tree lined streets\nAnd seeing quirky edgy things that is being lost by over development and ... which started under Mike Bloomberg but has accelerated with the Blasio administration\n... he just said that uh moves no I used to take a\nWhen I was a young man I used to think friends girls out to um Greenwich Village to have a cup of coffee which goes than five dollars and I'm Wondering whether that whole lumber mills has gone\nIt exists in smaller pieces the East Village is still um\nAnd we have a lot of schools I mean I chair higher education and this is in many ways the epicenter of education NYU the new school Cooper Union Pace University um boroughs Manhattan community college\nOr it's not a physically large area a and yet we have these major major institutions and so we have a lot of young people who are here on a regular basis and many of whom live and want to continue to live here\nAre so that still exists or more so to the east and the west but you know escalating real estate ah prices have made it more challenging for small businesses we have a lot of empty storefronts and it's not just the rent\nIt's the way in which people shop now I'm online shopping is a challenge for small local shops they try to find a nice ... but it is hard and the escalating rents make that even more challenging\nEverywhere I was going to ask you about this you just passed over something which is one of my great teams and that's the concept of the empty store\nNow that exist on the west side of this and the religion Broadway name id is not all about price point in other words greedy landlords who want to get more and more money out of those stores and so they leave him big until they get what they want words it would you just mentioned that there are other considerations\nWell I think it's I think it's both and it's split certainly escalating rents are are a real problem and it's a problem in residential as well as commercial uh that is for certain but it's also just\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nStudent loan debt or because of escalating tuition prices and that means you know we have a consumer economy and\nWhen people don't have disposable income these kids have a mortgage on their\nEducation they're not going to be able to get a mortgage on an apartment or house so it's changing what their choices are\nAnd it's also different uh in terms of what kind of jobs people have\nUm you know half of the young people are looking for jobs in tech or an advertising that's\nFocused more on a younger demographic and as a result they don't all have to buy suits and they don't have to wear a dress up close\nAnd so the shops are and stores that are selling that department stores are struggling just as much because people aren't necessarily driven to buy the same kinds of things and it's their idea of consumerism is\nA experiences so they want to go\nOut to eat and hang with their friends but they're not going to go to the mid range or higher priced\nRestaurant or so it's ... there's a lot of disruption in the economy\nAnd I'm sure this was true and another generation ah that face the different shift and the economic interests of people but it's it's very tough and empty storefronts create a sense of depression it said it creates an unsafe streets skate\nA let alone and on appealing visually a street scape a and that uh\nHas other consequences for uh so you know it's we are in a very tough time and you know the attempt to say well let's just keep cutting\nTaxes well the result is our subway system is a is a mess\nOr the streets need re paving and there isn't the same level of support schools uh have higher numbers of students in classes and they should\nSo the endless let's cut taxes mantra a you know I did a little thing in my newsletter I should send you my newsletters I'm about how what the taxes were", "show_name": "The Capitol Connection", "year":
