with love thousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nAnd just because they believe in Andrew Cuomo's philosophy a good government or the other officials philosophy of good government or you can believe that I Do that some of them putting the money and to get something out from the taxpayers on the other end so the point of the initial investigation is the answer\nWhich is it and in which case is is it that people are putting things in to get things out I mean we we should have found the buffalo billion thing before it happened right you know the convicted developer on one side and buffalo some analysis that got three quarters of a billion dollar contract to get\nA contributor to Andrew Cuomo you know you you have this instance what these I heard about these ...\nTwins I you know we hear about contributions from them and then there is talk of them getting a license one of the few bitcoin licenses you know you have the core development issue with the bribery with for cocoa\nRight they're replacing the biggest power plant in the state Indian point with gas power plants and lo and behold a gas plant developer comes in and bribes the governor's secretary so\nYou know you have the stuff over and over it's not the contributions to solve the problem you know it's free country people can treat contribute and participate in democracy is when people put things into the government\nAnd expect to get things out from the government at the expense of taxpayers you gotta look so that would be a first major area we would look at the other hand you've got to look at the revolving door\nRight you know you have the MTA people sweat in on the platform but does it take some of you know billions of dollars in hundreds of years seemingly to build anything right people are sweating on the platform because they can't get projects done\nOne of the continual issues with the MTA is this revolving door people going in and out of the industry agency between the agency and the big contractors on the other side of the government\nSo we got to look at that and say okay well why are these people going into these ... these companies what are they getting from those people is there some unfair improper advantage that they're getting\nAgainst the taxpayers by hiring the people who used to be on the taxpayers payroll so you know these are the things you have to work at the third thing at look at it as the contracts even before you get two indictments\nBefore you get to putting people in orange jumpsuits you have to look at the contracts for signing\nAnd one of the provisions of those and can those be improved\nWe have a lot of contracts that are in no bid contracts are single bitter contracts\nYou know when the government is in that position where there's only one person on the other side of the table we've got to be extra careful about what we do in those circumstances to make sure the contract doesn't go from a thousand dollars to a hundred thousand dollars to a million dollars to a billion dollars because we have a long history of cost overruns and\nYou know so so there are a number of things you can do on the contract side but it'd be nice to have someone who's actually spent you know blast twenty plus years looking at multibillion dollar contracts\nRight you know this is not something given the level of ... that you want there to be on the job training having someone with private sector contract experiencing knows the games people play\nWho knows the tricks people for who knows every trick in the book is something that the taxpayers would really benefit from\nSo we we have a number of things we can do civil way or we have a number of things we can do you know before we sign contracts and frankly we have another things to do in order to identify red flags in trouble spots in terms of getting our arms around corruption but the biggest thing you need someone with the independence unwillingness to actually do all of that and the expertise to do it well\nWere kids who rooted to ... going to be a democratic here I Believe a blue wave in a New York state\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com I no ... no

of the taxpayers pockets so you know when we talk about what's at stake\nWhich is the future of our state and whether we grow or whether we shrink whether our kids getting adequate education or whether we dumped whether people can get to work or whether they could not you know when you talk about the everyday steaks and the cost of this to people you know that\nOut ways for most dogs and certainly most people I've talked to\nThese issues coming out of Washington or the other thing though is that with respect to the president or anything else you know have an independent person and you know I\nConnect I contributed to block Obama\nWhen he first ran I've been for the other Democrats in the past politically\nAh so you know I was the person and I looked at the situation and I've always been\nYou know an outsider and extremely independent and you know the voters know not only that there are important state issues and critical state issues we have to deal with but they also are going to look at the person and not just say you know oh this is just to go some political consultant says the words mini me you know they're not going to be fooled by that\nThey've seen the parade a horrible we hadn't listened pretty general's office two of the last three you know probably should've been convicted of crimes right so the voters that enough of that\nAnd that's kind of transcend partisanship they just had enough and they know the importance in the states the state uh and so that's what I'm hearing all over the state I mean you know it's not a Democrat or Republican\nTo not want your government to steal from it if not Democrat or Republican to one public services to be delivered honestly effectively and so not withstanding you know some of the other things that are potentially going on out there\nWhat we're hearing around the state is that we're going to be in a position to win because we're the only viable alternative that provides what the voters shaped\nOkay so you got Michael ... have been running as the Green Party candidate you Christopher Garvey running as a libertarian but you're running as a Republican so I got to ask you this and I grew apologize in advance you're going to vote for Trump in twenty drain\nYou know I don't know what I'm going to do it twenty twenty we'll see we'll see what the record looks like\nYou know we've had this phenomena out in many many presidential terms whether it was Obama whether even was Reagan where presidents in their first term do things and the store in the early unpopular times during his first tour of him and then on the voters get to look back and\nSee the full entirety of the records you know they they take a step back and and they decide what they really want to do and in many cases you know that's a reelection and educationally and it's not you know and Bush one's case it was not so I'm gonna look back just like all the other voters in America and make a decision when we see the complete record\nNow what about the current attorney general's investigation into President Trump and the Trump family would you continue\nSo let's let's talk about this tax thing that came out I mean I I Know this is not a very ... politician thing to do to actually answer your question directly 'cause I'm going to do it I\nJust actually came out from the New York times last week you know the magnitude of it is huge um you know it goes back a lot of years um goes back I think they said the one that the president was three long before I was born and yeah I don't know what if there's anything these accused of doing that and but obviously it goes on for decades as a a mess\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hurt is dot com I no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nAnd I would continue to investigate that are in fact I I don't know if it's started yet I I hear were rumors state tax department get maybe looking at things but that's something of a magnitude that yeah you have to investigate it may you know my my view of all this stuff is that\nIn the office was not supposed to be part of some you're supposed to apply the law\nAnd you're supposed to apply to everyone equally and fairly and you you know that that's something that I can play to do frankly that that my opponent can't credibly say you know I I really\nNeed to we need to follow the facts whether it leads to Donald Trump or Governor Cuomo Republicans Democrats you know critics local politicians what have you\nUm that's what you have to deal with the office because we have to restore the credibility of the state's government and we have to restore the credibility of this office and we you know the way you do it is you stopped\nRunning this thing as a as a partisan vendetta machine um and you run it as something that works for the people and unbiased way\nSo people will let me ask you this you are of course African American and the greater Cheever you've done credible work and your life you go into our you've done all of these things like there are those people who would say that Donald Trump you know has given signals of racism OK his constituency how would you parse that for\nBullock you know my feeling is that as an African American you develop particularly if you you try to achieve success and have some\nSome success at achieving success that you've got to develop a pretty thick skin\nAnd so you know I I'm not a person who has a hair trigger\nAnd responding to real or perceived slight because if you if you let that stuff's distract you you're not going to get very far in life because there's always stuff that's going to be distractions and there's always going to be stuff that you can attribute to racism um sometimes it is racism many times it's not\nAnd so you you you've
