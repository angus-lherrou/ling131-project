Desmond used a peanut butter controversy to change our food regulation [noise]\nA lot of what the FDA does now and what it was doing back in the time of these peanut butter wars was trying to figure out how many peanuts should there be an peanut butter and should it be a hundred percent peanuts or if not then where should the line be drawn and and that quickly become the next the central question even if you think it's a really simple question beginning [noise]\nBefore we dive into peanut butter checking with reporters sheeley visited the bus station Tel Aviv to get great Filipino [noise]\nI'm good how are you\nGood um what started in Tel Aviv on a Saturday afternoon Sabbath there is a very large buck station two and a half million square feet there ... ... what started the story there\n[noise] okay so I'm Saturdays and Tel Aviv are pretty slow days most people including foreign workers have a day off today of rest public transportation shuts down a lot of the shops are closed people go to the beach and the bus station it's pretty much shut down\nExcept for the fourth floor which transforms into sort of a little manila\nThere is a food market and it comes alive with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Filipino workers at stepped in line and started talking to some of the women there\nOn Saturday how many minutes are coming here you know the\nHave a meeting guy friends some day I think some of the he got these they are setting here\nSo women Filipino caregivers who have their day off basically they got off work they go home and they'll either start cooking friday night or early Saturday morning and they show up at the bus station\nAround noon they'll bring these like huge plastic Tupperware it's filled with warm noodles and stir Fry's vegetable dishes little plastic containers full of\nDesserts um and they set up these tables in the hallway of the bus station there's also produce markets so they sell produce that normally you don't get in Israel so 'cause solve our route lemon grass\nDifferent bitter chords that you don't normally see in an Israeli grocery store and we'll all be like stocked up in the bus station and they can not only to eat and to have this and all your foods\nBut they also come to hang out with friends and see relatives and people who they knew from the Philippines to see how their work is going in to chat about working like Israel and life away from their families in the Philippines\nFor us federal dino Zaitz how people like happiness for\nTo give us relief you know from one week\nJob that they are all people\nSo ... how did you come across a story in the first place how did you find a force for the ...\n[noise] so I was reporting based in Jerusalem and I spent a lot of time going\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com a no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nAnd more time there and what's so amazing to me is that these\nWomen they live in a foreign country and they have a place that they can come together and taste something that's familiar\nThey a lot of them haven't been home in years and years they're separated from their families are separated from their kids and all week long they have to eat Israeli food which is so different from the food that they grow up with and this is the one day that they can come and\nFeel home and speak in their own language and eat the food that they grew up with\nEverything all most of the really being a food I Love what have you eaten today [noise]\nI eat ... and I double\nAll right well I Will certainly try that said thank you so much for your insight and yeah we'll see what happens to come thank you Bye bye\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher ... if you have a cooking failure a complete or if you just want to try to ... give us a call\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to Todd walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nWelcome to milk street who's calling\nMy name is Ryan I live and Logan, Ohio\nHi Ryan what is your question today\nWell my question is about ... and next to ... a week or some of our own field corn last year wow yeah it was a fun so we were trying to make at home and we did not have I guess it's\nHeckling Lyme so we're trying to use what ashes and we weren't really able to find a lot of good information so I was wondering if\nYou guys out and answers\nI go to Amazon and get the right stuff you get it to your door tomorrow that's what I Would do I've heard about what actually being used the question is what kind of ... I mean what do they do within that yeah I Would go get the right stuff\nBut by the way I Do have a question I assume it's a very specific type of corn growing for this right it's a field corn or like the kinds of field corn I mean who's to say\nRight that was another thing that came up we grew and Italian variety\nI Can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but I did notice the colonel's look a little bit more like popcorn but it's marketed as a Flint core and like something you know what you are or pull into we've made cornbread with it and things like that so that was another thought that I wondered if that\nWould make it more difficult to make most of what the the colonel's we're a little bit smaller points here kind of help popcorn is\nYou know you can buy muscles [laughter] I mean you're you're ... let me just to understand that you're doing this because it's in either perfectly agree with you this is just a cool thing to want to try to do right\nRight yeah I think it was an episode of fear is that they're talking about corn tortillas and how the flavor was better if you made it at home fresh compared to like using Moscow her you know like the stuff at the store that's dried\nNo I I don't think we were saying grow your own field corn boy you know by mixture pouring off getting rid of the ... boil it for four hours I think we just meant that if you made your own mixture at home instead of buying the pre made\nHere's a thought there's some wonderful our kids no uh companies that make rats and ... corn finance and mills is it it's an ... I wouldn't be surprised if you call it the ban some milk and asked them what is the proportion that they wouldn't tell you\nAnd then a lot of good call one of the companies that just order the mosque\n[laughter] and I think this is how I mean do you want to do one that would be my best suggestion even though both of us for hippies back in the day we we weren't trying to they're on tour with Ryan making so much yeah great question Naga event for the call you hope you find the answer\n[noise]\nNew listening to mistreat radio roses [noise]\nComing up next my conversation with horn I'll be chatting with her about the secret history of peanut butter after the\nSupport comes from Cary Institute of ecosystem studies ...

favorite foods peanut butter and then I teen fifties many companies were doctoring their recipes with untested additives\nRoof does men do Washington area homemaker decided to fight back and she changed the way food is regulated here in America reporter Krissy Clark produced a three part series on the peanut butter wars for marketplace and she's here today to tell us the story of the peanut butter\nGrandma Chrissy area I'm great thank you\nSo this all starts the late fifties people are manufactured peanut butter that's not all ...\nYeah often in significant amount not peanuts uh at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out these rumors started popping up that ah\nThere were in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is it the ... percenters is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of ingredients were perfectly healthy wonderful things does it really matter\n[noise] well I think that is a big question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was ah\nChris go there was actually in the factory formula [laughter]\nAt the just plant it was up to twenty percent Crisco and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks described it as if it wasn't a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream jobs are\nReally doesn't hydrogenated vegetable oil doesn't sound like a great concept so the\nConsumer reaction was fairly substantial 'cause you just tell us about it and how that happened and why did that happen and and how upset where people\nYeah well it all kind of\nComes down to this um one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of homemakers here's we've Desmond daughter Janet swap her\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and uh it's children that are eating these peanut butter sandwiches mostly in here it's just peanut flavored cream\nDesmond was a homemaker herself a very spirited very determined woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom bio mass words to warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nAmerican history where food was really transforming that was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant\nA and so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice\nThat mentioned that they were proposing a standardized definition for peanut butter and uh when she discovered that what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nA lot of the hydrogenated vegetable oil into the jar of peanut butter that she was by and she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers\nAnd a flood of consumer comments started coming in to the FDA hundreds literally hundreds of letters here it's Janet again\nHe said I Will tell everything I Will get all the facts and I will laugh it to everybody because everyone needs to be an informed so she called herself and the ... and that's what she got and that's what was in our news letter you know telling people all the\nHearing and what was going on and the bills in Congress she put it in her newsletter and [noise]\nSo uh one of the things you pointed out is that from the FDA point of view this was a labeling issue in other words if you just honest about what's in it it's okay and roof I think at a different point of view she didn't want\nStuff other than you know to peanut butter so is the FDA still dealing with regulation in terms of truth in advertising in the label more so than what's actually in the\nBottle well one of the big things that the FDA was tasked by Congress was doing was promoting honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers when it came to food\nAnd so that covers a lot of things but one of those is that labels should be truthful and and missile labeling something as a crime\nUm\n... you're listening to ... radio coming

on what kind of like a lot ... than sort of how the California style that caught our eye out and then when I looked at it than it is like cocoa hotter but\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nAnd I read up and I it's I guess that's how it has and then they get killed and I think something\nThat's right yeah Cal powders just coal pressed cocoa beans that are not roasted as opposed to Coco which is roasted beans that are turned to pattern records the fattest removed as well\nI've looked it up actually once someone said you have to use more Dutch process cocoa than ... powder is kept powder maybe stronger taste thing but I don't I've never tested it I Would try one to one but I Would think the press is going to be stronger flavor\nYeah I Would imagine that a good thing yeah and I I think Alex oh and please get back to us and we'd like to follow up\nOkay well I have had my path so make something that\nWe like that but uh so yeah I well I ... I ... I\nWelcome to the street who do we have on the line I my friend and they can hide ... how can we help you today\nI got some green coffee beans from a friend of mine and I just have to do I try to roast 'cause that's where I needed to do with it really know what to do it either\nSo I tried to ... pair for a while and uh they kind of started letting off these real paper ... skin is worth it yeah it is to go from green color to burn it yeah\nThat's what they do crates you've done is now about ten years ago I went through this whole process because I Love coffee and er I bought a number of different roasters sort of the the popcorn popper where the their air rated and they they go up in the air and swirl around\nI did the rotating drum roaster the more expensive one and here the problems first of all a lot of smoke so you have to do it underneath the hood of some ... to New York city apartment secondly I found that every batch of beans had different roasting time and temperature\nAnd it's very complicated to get a roast right 'cause otherwise some of the burn and some of them are green and he has this problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than actually was worse than beans I could just buy at the local louder may play for like a so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right\nTo get the roasting the flavor right\nYou know and the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time\nI never had much luck these things are expensive and it's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go to who gave I finally well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not ground beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way to go well\nLet's bring any kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nUp on that kinda stuff I've only got a couple of pounds of these green beans I don't think it's worth it that's great oh maybe do it just sort of like in a pan or something easy\nOn ... on three or four hundred dollars and get around [laughter] and I gave up after a while and we found\nIs second hand you know a popcorn popper you know to thrift store it might be worth it\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place is like ten different kinds of beans and you can get really good teams and make or break off of the other\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom bio mass woods to warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nWith these things is also a little tricky trucking so anyway there you go ... thank you so much okay Brandon thanks for calling nice recalling already took her\nThis is mostly radio I'm your host Christopher Kimball please give us a ring the number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eighty five five four to six Ninety four three or send us an email questions and milk street radio\nDot com welcome to the street who's calling Hi this is Han Casey how can we help you today okay\nSo um you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook my one weakness I think is with desert\nThe one problem that I have let this happen to deal with the frosting and the icing the decoration presentation all of that\nI Try a lot of recipes at home for my own crossing and I think but they never seem to work for the icing I Try that out or sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out ... ... and then I tried to cream cheese one in the mix or oh so it doesn't work\nWhat happens to the cream cheese when\nIt never really become credible like I always even though I keep it room temperature I always feel like it clumps and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there though how can I make really good ... and I think at home\nI agree with you that the powdered sugar I ... yeah I really you can add like orange juice to understand but I I don't orange that idea they never turn out now and I don't like him a chocolate crossing always works nicely because of the chocolate cools it sets up\nI like an Italian ... er it's with spring which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup\nLike at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much and then you drizzle it on the egg whites as beating them and the mixer for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so it's not that hard to do but you have another\nNo I was just going to say the ... which is sort of similar involved egg white friend out what just sugar water egg whites ... but the thing about the Italian so you add the sugar served the egg whites there's also the sweats where you heat up the sugar in egg whites and look at too about one sixty\nThose are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for crossing I assume\nI mean that's what I Would prefer to start that way I can kind of build at my confidence to start working with something a little bit more advanced\nI think the cream cheese frosting though that's going to give you a good texture and that's going to hold really well too\nAnd I wonder if maybe that's more technique issue with me and not maybe really knowing how to work with my mixture\nYou have a hand mixer or stand mixer\nA stand mixer\nAnd what happened you said it was just the texture with two stiffer\nIt's like the cream cheese still state kind of clunky oh\nHow long did you leave the cream cheese room temperature before you made the frosting\nMaybe an hour to an hour and a half\nThe only thing I can suggest is to take the cream cheese out kind of into pieces not what it's OK and left that's in a room temperature for an hour and a half okay I think it just feels so it sounds to me like the cream cheese would still too cold 'cause that's what would happen if it was too cold or wouldn't get smooth and it wouldn't beat up properly\nBut I always say that's your Goto frosting 'cause that's easy you know hold you know the switch them in Italian ranks don't hold the next day very well uh and they are tricky to me are tricky powdered sugar thing it's just I don't know just awful tastes pretty awful I mean with you\nStreaming support for WAMC come from birch are Center for
