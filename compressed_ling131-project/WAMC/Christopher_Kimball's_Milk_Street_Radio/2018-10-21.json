exploring everything from Chile bond to a dozen different types of local beings\nRodney how are you\nI'm well Chris how are you I'm good I'm supposed to talk about ... what is it an amalgam of a million different kinds of things if you were to describe it is there a way to describe it to make sense or is just too diverse\n[noise] um the way to describe it makes sense says to accept that it's complicated and a moving target somewhat um and and that you can shape parameters around it but those parameters some time shift also ah the territory that I looked at\nEnded at West Virginia and it goes down and shoot the northern edge of South Carolina I'm In the mountains of north Georgia and Alabama and of course ah Kentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina\nAnd if I left anybody out please don't hurt me [laughter] um and so so even the geographic definition a can stretch and come together\nDo you you drove a van regular right you're driving I have a van it's a Chevy astro are [laughter] so how many miles how long you set out to do this trip the pilgrimage um what were you looking for and how long were you doing\n[noise] honestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles and then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that so it was quite it was it was very literally in Germany you know the subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipes\nAnd that was important to me because a lot\nOf what is written and has been written about um the people in the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nWell a lot of comments from one person's perspective and their family but there are their experiences in Appalachia and I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we are right this monoculture hum\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated\nUm [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks Rob scotch Irish [laughter] um so they're they're actually the last census\nThere are more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American men are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point in my interest is that if you look at the food way\nYou can start to pick apart the complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge um some of the sanctions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about ... Appalachia\nA perfect poised to talk about food so you are you say chili been carried out from the ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog heartless invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nBack yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain\nA chili Brian is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy\nChili mixture hamburger mix here that it was packed into a hotdog bond with onion and with mustard and the texture it's extremely important that it's not like a sloppy Joe if it's not kind of slurping around the area it's in there being I'm\nFrom and the best way to think about those as this this this is a dish that was to my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat\nYou don't want something what Chile on your hands right yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food you know this really through\nThe ... sweet and savory banana pudding it had powder jolt of the custard okay I can forgive you though but has red meat so red ... no no wait a minute now that's that's a that's a ... thing but you're from red meat so into a savory banana put in what's going on\nAnd well we are being first of all true to the Appalachian palate one of my mother's favorite terms\nAbout taking a food food that went from pretty good too oh yeah yeah buddy ... she would say it had a wind to it and I and I think joined me Chris I'm campaigning to make that an official coronary term ... what is weighing mean\nWell I think that the best way to describe it is it is kind of those\n... accent a sour and salty and maybe a little bit of sweet that just elevates whatever you're eating up to another level doesn't dominate you know it comes in underneath and it sort of raisins it up\nIt's like a good bluegrass ... singer\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto general\nJim how are you I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is a and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well kids are base was better than ours but you went to Italy you have to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nYou know one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong [noise]\nFirst of all our ratios ingredients for way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough ... they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist with that\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course produces a thicker more luxurious sauce we think we have to finish beforehand that doesn't work\nI also learned that we get the order wrong and the order in which you add the ingredients are either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the nasal for example into soon you're gonna over process that are over ... and that's going to give you the wrong finished consistent\nSo your goal here is to get a pass to this pretty dry it's not the green sauce right it's dry\nIt's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before it touches the pasta but really if it's that lose then you've added to much olive\nOil and in general pessimism custard done I feel it's been added to pasta with some of the pasta water then it's considered pass or not is considered a complete but that's why I say we are way too much all of them are we supposed to be dinner at an earlier state so\nWhat's the order of the ingredients okay the order is very important again 'cause you don't want to over process the ingredients you start out with the garlic to find out to salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find face that he's usually distributed through the faster\nThan we had our cheeses you want them finally ground add those in and again you add those to the high end up in the garlic you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the chiefs now the biggest will goes it but what are the things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the biggest ally and like they do in Italy reason is they use smaller more tender base and there\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com a no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com ... but\nThe solution is pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on a cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of pulses and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general we use food processors just as probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had an journal\nWrote it lacks the romance of ... with a mortar and tough so but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the war that we're getting really close and I got to say it is delicious so\nJim ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as
