in our family settled in Texas before Texas was part of the u._s. um that using the local ingredients and more kind of\nMexican influenced cooking styles and dishes and food that\nIs Mexican but it's also Texan and it's really fundamentally a regional cuisine of\nTexas so there are a few ingredients that really a defined Tex Mex ... versus let's say traditional Mexican cooking what what would be some of those ingredients\nSo interestingly one of those ingredients is human in San Antonio there's actually\nA small but significant population people who came from the Canary Islands and the thought is that there's so much human in Chile and therefore started moving forward a lot of Tex Mex cooking because of the influences that specific cuisine of the Canary Islands\nAnd the chili pit

lot of people have written the Taco Bell et cetera had an adverse effect on Tex Mex\nBecause branded Tex Mex is being fast food or cheap food so Tex Mex whether one direction at least for a while and

currently a columnist of the Daily Beast and just launched a new special series with the sport full pod cast\nMe how are you I'm very well very well I I don't want to rehash too many things everyone knows but ah in December Seventy five you became to food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the New York times is that correct\nOr not quite the woman who wouldn't hire may was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire may name where Charlotte Kurdish the woman who did hire me was Joan Whitman and of course hired by the editor of the paper Abe Rosenthal\nYou still remember both of those names [laughter] well ... fortunately for all votes you became a critic uh first of all it's a very artificial way of eating 'cause you go with the crowd everybody wonders different foods you get to taste you can't just enjoy one thing or two things you have to try to eat everything obviously has critic [laughter]\nIs that something you eventually get used to and and get to like or is it always a a burden that as you would prefer not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested to know

not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested\nTo know what I Would find out and I think when you do it that way you kind of know how to separate flavor is in your mind it was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could eat the same thing tonight and have a ship experience\n[laughter] yeah well it sounds like me [laughter]\nSo we did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or in the end where people often do go with crowds uh\nWas never more than four people and usually just my husband and myself on the first try to see what's going to be worth reviewing before we filed a lot of people and expense into it\nI Know that other critics after you at the times got a lot of ... about dressing up in disguises but you were the I think the first one to really do that I I Love this quote a ... you said even before the Internet and I was recognized a few times\nThey are very few things more embarrassing to show up in a way glasses and have the owners say quote good evening Mr\n[laughter] exactly I I Would say [laughter]\nYou didn't know what should I flip off they'll do eggs should I you know play its ... third and I had glasses and wigs I didn't I didn't wear strange outfits though\nNow let's talk about one of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop you lie cetera you're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices and I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers which really like Yelp and so on are\nSo right I I actually agree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right\nWell first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but even more I have never seen and I'm willing to be wrong on this I have never seen any such service require proof that the person has been a good point\nI have gotten in the past not for a long time justice on a mailing list for example many years ago\nThe question asked from the gap saying asking me to be a response to do with all the things to fail and\nAnd I thought how do they know if I'd been there I've even asked Tim's that gap that and he said we have a way to which I say baloney because you could just a ... if it's a friend who owns the restaurant a relative\nOr if you just want to sound often use you repeat that kind of rating from your local credit just to have a voice in there so\nI don't really care what those people say\nYeah that that's true I mean social media you see all sorts of strange comments and their access to the ground all over\nSo let's talk about casual dining I think you and I come out of the same place you walk into a restaurant in the first

of help on the floor\nI might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and I'm moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty\nI might notice the overall age of the people I might notice if there are serving stations around the room I'll tell you a funny story about that there is a super\nGreek Dinah in Chicago known as little Mitchell's and it's right near the Merck until exchange in the stock exchange and it opens four or five in the morning because the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just larger than life at the breakfast and I went one morning alone because I was writing about Chicago restaurants I went around eight thirty and I have to stand on line a little and does he does the owner or his manager gives out little boxes of\nI'm a\n... a candy what do they call it any way to to women\nStanding on the line and finally after about Fifteen minutes I became the head of the line and the manager came over to me and said where is your place\nAnd I said what place and he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\nThat I really didn't for [laughter] it's like Campbell or in a casino like [laughter] you know look around and milk\nThat is what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line\nAnd you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast Scott cooked prone in a slice of orange and a little cup of yogurt no matter what you would if I imagine it's still the same but it was wonderfully observant of this man to notice my eyes working\nThe room mark I I'm ... you'd like Joel rubber Shaw or in his cooking when you talk about his famous potatoes with a pound a butter and a pound of cooked puree potatoes but he had a great quote I'm a ...\nAnd will always be one could you just explain what that means and why you thought that was so wonderful\nSo I don't know how they're used to do it in Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen would we do\nSo critically really took the wind out of the equation in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation\nAnd so we have really hit pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of these really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pat her and we put that in a pot with some aromatic and no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to ... comes from the meat itself\nThere's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavor so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice\nAnd you're not such a thing that made before you put it in just you cook the ... a little bit then put the meat and when you're not doing anything else to leave before because\nNot we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of ... to me\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC

just you cook the ... a little bit then put the meat and when you're not doing anything else will be before because there\nWere not that we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of saw tend to me without actually having to do the work which you know we love around here\nSo instead of cooking at the whole time covered we take the cover off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning underneath there that you would have gotten if you were taught to hate it at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the one to the ones not in the ones waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the right to be at the end I Hope\nIt does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning really diluted not only the flavor of the sauce economy the meat tastes a little weird as well\nSo we waited until the very end to add that so we take the meat out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strange meat chooses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich sauce\nSo this recipe the trucks can be from peppered through almost no prep work cook a little use tomato paste the beat in three hours of the up and take it a reduced some warning through that in and you're done\nIt's amazing and it takes quite a taste so good when

I really appreciate all of that you and Chris expose this too and provide thank you I like to cook and I really um I read something new and I want to try you know these new global type recipes\nMy question for you is what some pantry staples that would bring in a more global fair that I could use regularly and like\nOh boy yeah we're going to have to pick and choose you asked us to limit it and that's hard it's like well you want to start with spice blends first and then move on those are I mean I think\nThe spices the most people don't have the sitar which is based on while time but it's got lots of stuff in it I think is the most versatile youthful spice blend in the world outside sesame seeds and for Mac\nYeah ensue Mac would be another thing it's a very used to be used almost in place of lemon it's our but it's also lemony great on tomatoes you can use it on almost anything\nCoriander seed not ground coriander is something most people do have around I think is also really useful\nI'm going to put in a bed for a pet ... ... that's really great also because for vegetarians you know when you can add bacon or smoked salmon or some sort of port product you can add smoked ... had to give it a little bit it's nothing you can\nBuy India they have these little tens which have smaller tens in them for spices ... and you can buy one of those tell them it's all and you can keep in that ten sort of the old purpose spices and spice blends so for example\nAt breakfast I'll take the ten out and put some sitar and some pepper or something on it and you can dress up eggs you can dress up anything\nNext is pantry items I think teeny is literally a must yeah and me so\nDanny by the way it goes gray with chocolate hurry to yes absolutely mix it with Greek yogurt for ... for example or as the sandwich spread me so it was a great soup base white meat so for chicken or ed and isolate the fish when you're young yet\nAnd then my last generation would be pomegranate molasses which you can find almost everywhere it's our and it's sweet you can use it and I use it in a salad dressings just a little bit any kind of dressing or you can drizzle it over meet after its cook\nOr ice cream or ice cream anywhere you use a good quality ... can you see a pomegranate molasses I also want to throw in a vote for ... ... can they provided smoking is Anna wonderful heat\nTo other simple things if you buy whole human seed if you get a pepper Grider putting coarse salt and then putting human seat\nSo instead of salt and pepper your rights seller in human yeah and that is just for a general purpose way to improve your cooking you really can't beat that\nAnd then the last thing is have really big Critz seat Salter Florida seller molten salt\nJust to finish food or would that crunch and you get a lot of mileage off that that's a good start yeah okay that is a great start at one life thing if you want to be a little exotic bite or if a pepper you are FA you have to bite on line it's a soft damp pepper in sort of flakes\nAnd chocolate ... and rich not too hot you know it goes on a lot of dishes just a few little tricks like that can\nMake your cooking so much better so

might get range recently went out and needs replacing I got it bad for how much it would cost ... kitchen which is going to be about a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nSo I'd like to know your opinion I never cooked on a gaffe strange but I Know it generally preferred by professionals that knowing that extra cost I Would encourage half is luxury is it worth it\nWell when we built out the ... street kitchens a couple of years ago for a variety of reasons we couldn't use all gas cook tops we had to use ... for many of them\nAnd I was not a fan of that but we did in Seoul induction it turns out induction\nWorks very well it heats up fast uh it's not any slower than gas I prefer dial you know and I like to see the gas but once you get used to the controls than it does a terrific job it's also safer because you're not going to buy yourself so I Know anyone ...\nChristmas you know an induction is yet and that it ...\nAnd the point is that it heats up the pan through magnetism through the metal\nIn the pan so that only the pan heat's not really the burner and it really hates it efficiently and you can get it high and get it low very quickly and here's the thing about induction you'll save money in the long run because\nIt's the most energy efficient of all forms of heat and cooking 'cause the heat only goes into the pan gap is the least efficient cars the flames go out on the side that he goes out on the side it's not contained and electric it's better than gas but induction hands down the best so you'll probably save money and otherwise\nIt's just the one thing I Would look out for is the controls 'cause I've used a bunch of these some of the control you know used to be like in my day like in a car you'd have a radio which has station control in volume yeah and I could figure it out with industrial controls I mean it's like you have to hit the button three different buttons and it can be complicated", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Christopher
