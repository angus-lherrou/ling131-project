I'm Talking to Steven Hamburg about his place\nOn the side of bald mountain in West camp to New Hampshire\nSo that month that I had terrified months of what it was about some of that time was spent on the side of bald mountain west camped and looking at sites in trying to understand what the landscape looked like explaining what I saw in ways that it made no sense to me\nSo I ... that's when I said I fell in love with the forest I fell in love with the forest so I ended up studying it and then I really needed a whole\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nAnd so I wanted that place and I said what better place than where I fell in love with the natural world so I was able to buy a a nice piece of forest on the side of bald mountain\nAnd so I spent the last uh thirty three years they're building a cabin in my own hands\nAnd while at the same time studying the forest and watching a change over forty years it's where I've observed climate change first hand in ways I Would never see anywhere else because I have seen the things I predicted forty years I published Thirty years ago predictions\nThat I've seen come true in my lifetime and I would have never predicted that would happen\nThis is not good news this is not good news but what it but are you in your intellectual Gore but this is terrible it's\nTerrible but at the same time what one of the things that I also know about it because I study land use history as well\nIs that one of the hardest things for we as for humans to do is to recognize the role of change and so one of the things is I realized my own limitations when I envision that change forty years ago\nSo whether it's good or bad I'm not quite as shore now because I just didn't have the powers to see this as a dynamic landscape in the way\nThat is both affected by climate change but also affected by\nAll of this history all those people who live there before and this is a place that never had Native Americans so it's had a relatively short history of human occupation says I'm populated by human beings for all of human history until ... well relative in history is seven Seventeen eighties\nWas the first Seventeen seventies were first time anyone spend any significant time they're probably some Native Americans wandered through but it's a harsh environment up in the White Mountains but no one ever there's no no evidence of human occupation so one of the things that it's\nHer Borman really impressed me told a story of his his great inspiration is big scientific finding was that development of what's called a small watershed technique we're thinking about how nutrients flowed across the landscape and it happened while he was walking up mount ... when he was a dark that\nHaving an argument with his post doc\nWill I Believe a lot of scientific inspiration comes that way so when I'm walking through the woods I don't I'm not going out for a scientific walk but I'm observing and I'm thinking and I recognized in I think that's gonna be a a level of insight I wouldn't have if I just go out there when I'm working\nRight that makes perfect sense I mean when the association between walking and fought is it's ancient that when they want to show someone thinking they showed them pacing back and forth and and and go you go take a walk and you get ideas um but do you think it matters that you're walking in those words\nYeah because it's the same woods ones that I've studied the ones that I Know more about than anyone else ... a level of knowledge of those woods maybe he's not more than anyone else but they are very few people have that level of knowledge so I have I've been following those plots literally for forty years we've been re sampling watching the change quantitatively as well as qualitatively\nSo have quantitative data in a qualitative data how was this change and seeing it on science I understand what quantitative data is what it's called ... it's not measuring it it's observing it okay\nSo I'm observing it I'm not measuring it and so\nSo for example when it rains looking at the patterns of rainfall which have changed over those forty years and how it's expressed in the forest [noise] if I hadn't been in a Hurricane Irene in the woods trying to make my road not a a overflowing the culverts work I saw ...\nSupport for streaming on WAMC comes from the Davis financial group providing the based financial planning and wealth management services to individuals families and business owners in the pioneer valley and beyond Davis financial G.
