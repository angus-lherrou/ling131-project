I mean we're you know or depending what ... ... they've got Mavis Staples I agree what are we are yeah I Know not much not that I don't love your yeah but a ... but it it it seems very meager kind of at least we'll church or ...\nYeah I Will not want to leave their feet to defend it will because I I think that's true but but but I think it lives I think it really ... I think\nThe ... the feeling and that's all that lives in a in this a great American songs\nOn that if that's what we mean by Jewish music and I think we should yeah because then we ... we don't have to take any credit for anybody\nDo early yeah [noise]\nYeah I'm the soul of it is definitely in there for sure yeah and the melodies\nIt is I don't think so what is it is yeah music right yeah absolutely\nI mean we weren't so or have have from my perspective have just as much of a claim to be regarded as Jewish music as any clubs were brave\nYeah I I mean I think I think Judaism is such a um an amorphous thing is in in American culture it's not everyone defines it for for themselves what is what it means to be a Jewish American and um\nAnd so I think in just searching for a sound that felt authentic to myself when I arrived at with some amalgam of um\nYou know Eastern European stuff American stuff and\nGreat American song book sounding music\nJust Jewish or ... yeah I think are the best possible way are we planning another number ... ... take a moment and we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com I Know choke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nRider about his place a synagogue in Azerbaijan where he and his group performed during a State Department tour\nBefore we left I was talking to my friends about it and someone mentioned to me that there was a community of Jewish people in the country that are sort of a distinctive ethnic group known as the mountain Jews they fled uh Persia\nI think thousands of years ago and have lived in the caucus mountains ever since they have their own language and culture that's distinctive um and so I was really excited when I found out that one of the towns we were going to be performing in with this town ... which is Q. U. P. A.\nM. and that is where one of the communities of the Jewish people are and so when we got to the town I said to the embassy ... that we were working with you know look I'm Jewish and I would love to go visit these people after our show is finished and so\nWe played this giant show or like that an apathy it or they were probably like five thousand people there um and afterwards our tour bus followed the local government officials through these windy streets basically across the tracks to\nThis old dilapidated synagogue um\nAnd we pulled up in the parking lot or got out of the bus and it's all there are these two old men standing and having some sort of\nConversation or argument in in the parking lot and ah we walked up to them I had a a translator on my right and the embassy that's essay on my left\nAnd I turned to the translator and I said could you please tell these men that I'm Jewish\nAnd I'm from ah Brooklyn and I would love to see inside the synagogue and one of the old guys looks at me and goes though what you're Jewish my son he lives in Brooklyn\n[noise]\nSo you're happy with you all guys the arguing and ... those are the Jews\nI'm as anyway there we did we did we we actually brought our instruments inside we played a little bit it turned out it was really interesting it turned out the synagogue had actually been converted into a factory for about a hundred years I think during the Soviet\nEra I'm a but before that had been a synagogue so anyways it was a very interesting place I picked it mostly just because they like telling that story or ... or ... ... since then I found out that the guy that cut my hair in crown heights isn't a very Jew\nBut on the mountain Jews or which I keep complaining with mountain gorillas I don't know I just wishful thinking on my part I'm a ... they don't speak Hebrew right um I have many a Muslim costumes like they take their shoes off\nAs I understand that when they enter the synagogue it's that people who are of a similar edited and what what's essentially a Muslim culture for a long\nTime mhm it sounds like you know more about it than I Do\nUh I remember that that's pretty much everything I Know I just shot it right there but I'm\nA I guess what I was getting out and it has to do with what we're talking about about the music too is that what did we me and my Jewish and this sense yeah cause you saw something\nThat said hey I'm a Jew\nRight right and we try and you know what and when we when I did\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com I no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nAnd I tried I played ... which is the prayer from a here we go there goes my Jewish knowledge out the window Yom Kippur poor yet\n[noise] [noise] Oh thank you Matt\n[laughter] um okay so I never do the show without a rabbi in the house now now you're the guest\nMy ... [laughter] sort of vacuum at uh [laughter] but did you did they respond to that no\nI don't know why not I think\nMaybe the way that I the way that I Know the melody might not have been the way that they knew the morality because that is one thing about a lot of Jewish songs and mail it it's just that they're very different depending on what synagogue you go to or what are you what your background is um and I don't know I don't know about that particular song that one to me it sounds so quintessentially Jewish\nBut by Jewish I think in this do you mean Eastern European yeah\nBut these are not this isn't even the Arctic is it it's it's something something else or [laughter] or getting the thumbs up from ... back there right so\nI guess what I'm asking you to in what sense you're ... you're in price them and you identify with and when you reach out to say I I Am of your tribe right right but what does that mean here\nI don't know it's something that I think about all the time living in crown heights because there's so many hostage and orthodox people around me that I don't think necessarily would even I I could be wrong but I don't seem like they would necessarily include me in there\nYou know conception of what the Jewish community is in in the neighborhood um and I don't particularly identify with them either um so once again like I was saying before I feel like everybody sort of comes up with their own um definition of what it means to you know to be of Jewish descent\nOne bit of folk wisdom that always struck me as completely fall to the idea that music is a universal language not at all is it your breathing a particular kind of music to people who maybe are unfamiliar\nYeah I've been thinking a lot about that actually I I um\n[noise] I think it's true I I I think that um\nMusic is not a universal language\nHowever I Do think that um\nIt's it's sort of like a an invitation of some sort to some sort of um interaction\nAnd all kinds of things can happen without language you can learn a lot about a person even when you can't speak with them um and you can um and and there's something really profound that happens when you\nPerform for people\nUm there's something about music that actually gets beyond language because I think it it touches on emotion and it touches on the soul in a way that I'm oftentimes words cannot um [noise] and and it it it's very it can be so um it can be such a wonderful way to initiate further", "show_name": "Person Place Thing", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "20"}
