{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "A I think that there is honor to be found in ... uh staying a a true and loyal to those who are intimate and most important in one's life um odd at the rules are the I think the the rules the morals so to speak everything shift when it comes to personal\nUh relationships um it's it's not so she's not speaking in front of a court of law here um and I think uh\nUh I can respect or a wife for a son or anyone we love it if someone who's been accused of some\nSome crime just signed by that person to offer them the kind of support that they are in dire need of now she May of course being a lying to a great exchange which to me it's more chest amounts of her\nUh her feelings and and being true and these difficult times for her to go and say yes it he I've always thought he was a terrible the immoral person speak ill of her even more than of him\nOr if it does put me in mind that if I had to choose between loyalty to my friend and loyalty to my country I Hope our troops loyalty to my friend\nUm that different relationships involved different obligations ... she's not speaking as a member of the CBS board of directors right on the other hand if if what has been said about him his true well she's flat out why he is not a good ma'am I'm well I'm without it I'm\nSorry that way for is if in fact they in there is some sort of a trial and and it's been there is evidence and it's it's proven that he's guilty of X Y and Z I she can reframe\nUh the way in which she will express support for her husband but I don't think uh it's I Would never indicted her a for a finding any way and possible to support her love it in times of crisis\nDo you think she knows you think the summer so intimately bound up with another person must have some inkling into their conduct\nDid she know I don't know I I really I I don't want to say that it means that oh she must have been an idiots\n'cause I don't think that's fair um I think that uh there are ways that of a uh being insulated from certain rules um odd and it's possible that there was a kind of subconscious insulation self insulation\nI'm I don't know I don't know enough to make that judgment and I don't think it's fair to make those judgments uh when we don't know enough\nI I Would say more just I don't want this to be confused with the Trump being sense of loyalty which is a very\nDifferent thing oh I think that's completely true yeah I I liked your distinction between um loyalty in a professional setting and loyalty among intimate yeah yeah we're not talking about them off ... right right [noise]\nI like to do the moral complexity an ambiguity I'm so we'll take a moment\nWe'll be like that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nTo say that I can go\nOn\nI ... to talk so long [noise] okay so here's a place to talk of the American dream mega mall currently under construction in the Meadowlands of east Rutherford New Jersey set to open in March I Will be the biggest small in the usa\nIt will have a twelve stories ski slope and we'll have a roller coaster it will be a kind of theme park but ultimately the real famous shopping isn't it it's acquisition and it's that sort of just based well\nTo to to say that ... to say that is the base just is it to ... to pick on one tiny detail of the ... life in in this country uh where where everything we is we we live in a consumer society so it's so\nUh where where are our theaters are are named after a corporations and a\nA where um [noise] uh stadiums of for athletics or first baseball and and so forth are also named after corporations and\nSo this is to me at such a tiny little example of of that defined so much of what it means to be an American in this age where the emphasis is so much on consumption and I think this uh this whole secular consumerist a\nA kind of a deity under which are we ... that we worship in some sense and lived through in ways that were not fully conscious of\nA I mean that's how I grew up you grew up in New Jersey yes [noise]\nYes I'm from Livingston New Jersey where that's where I grew up so um what's\nThe mall feature of your youth\nDoes your ... to the mall yes as I grew up it became more and more so\nI remember when there was a there was an outdoor mall and then there was the Livingston Mall which I think was built when I was about twelve and it quickly became a kind of destination um ... odd for a man he's a young people in and\nAnd of course very quickly certain malls I became a hatch just distinguish themselves to create certain different kinds of status this was a cheat mall this was a posh mall\nAnd then more even the word mall has to be changed so that and I think here in Manhattan they they created the shops at Columbus Circle because we're more with so degraded wealth\nBut I always thought if I wanted to live in Atlanta I've moved to Atlanta on you know\nBut that was but that's part of the ... but but but that's what the Manhattan has been a very suburban ice in so many ways\nAnd in in in justice we influence of it's such an impact in the city on the suburbs they have\nA a great impact the suburbs on life here in the city as well and certainly a someone like myself I I I came up from the suburbs where the dream of escaping them so I could live in the city only to see so much of it a\nA churns suburban which becomes kind of um [noise] a shorthand for a banality and middle middle brow and so forth and\nIt also a shorthand for shopping that that that's what I take to be suburbanization that the central social activities going to buy stuff [noise] well\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu ...\nUh is is is taken to a such a high level\nOf a of a where status is so much defined by where ... where you shop in\nWhat you find it where you shop and so forth I can say that it's it's just that there's less there was at least when I was growing up there was less going on um but that's for someone like myself culturally it it it was as some people might have described it as a wasteland and yet I'm a ... if\nYou were a consumed with a a sports in athletics there was a lot to do and that is that it wasn't all to find of course simply by the dream of shopping um uh uh it's just there wasn't much other than sports that that was going on\nAnd a cultural culturally and so uh one of the default um solutions was ah you go to the mall and if not to shop at least you have to imagine that you were actually doing something\nTo imagine you are doing\nDoing something meaningful when in fact you argue on something meaningful and that you are consuming even just the images the advertising and on the whiff of of ah ah the desire ability of all these things that perhaps you could buy are and how they might in fact change were alive\nBut you came to New York to escape that you're like a uh nineteenth century French provincial who goes to Paris to flee from dull Bush will live for the life of the metropolis um so so this doesn't seem like much of a meaningful pursuit in them all from New Jersey\n[noise] well I it it it depends how you define meaningful hear from you find it for\nMe I look I\nShopping can there I think there can be meaning even in shopping if they're it's kind of ... there can even be an art to shopping the way in which you the ... the way in which you observe the way things are sold in the way you are able to\nAh see how that is ... how that reflects upon the world in which you live\nUm it's not all about a quiz Egyptian it said it it I mean that's the aim obviously for the the corporations but\nBut as a shopper there are different ways I think there is such a thing as as an arts in a creative way let's say of shopping\nUm uh it it just says a there is a creative way to all sorts of endeavors\nI'm a people often say that oh if you are an artist or a writer you must be so imaginative so creative but really there are many artists or many writers who are not terribly creative or imaginative\nAnd yet there are many people who are not artists who in their fields and endeavors are extremely creative and imagine the tips so it's really the way in which you approach these things as we know and and Hollywood of course people will say these movies are not so creative", "show_name": "Person Place
