doing to them too he he ...\nIf I if I have this right he's a fought against the very formation of actors equity\nThat's right and try to crush the union yeah he was a union buster um he felt like the way to do it was the way that he did it which is that he would see a penniless actor\nOn the street corner and he would give them some money is is that with some sort of system but that's what he did he thought he was very generous to the people so he thought the whole strike was or they were incredibly ungrateful to him and that that this this is working fine he'd see somebody's down and out you give the money\nBut he was he was personally in that way quite generous was he not apparently yeah uh yeah\nIt's I like I like a life of contradiction yeah he's full of contradictions oh statue
