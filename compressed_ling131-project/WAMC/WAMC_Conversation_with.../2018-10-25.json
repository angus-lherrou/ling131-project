New York since Nineteen\nEighty four gym out a way a great hero of mine I Will be perfectly honest I shouldn't appear falling but I Am because you have done such magnificent things for so many people let's start from the beginning you were born into a distinguished journalistic family how's that affected you\nKnow newspapers are my life as young as six years old I found while going through my mother's papers when she died in a hundred and one two years ago she saved a a copy of a little newspaper I made in Nineteen forty five\nWhere I must have been home sick I Would flip out headlines from the newspaper my father's local paper was the end the cotton daily bulletin and the cat in New York I'm saying is that where you were in ... I grew up in ... interesting little time to actually come and well they\nAre all those of us who know a little bit about Binghamton also know that Johnson City an Endicott exactly now three the triple cities\nThere so I found this this little paper and I even wrote a little editorial in at about the rising price of Turkey's them it was going to be a problem for mothers' cooking for Thanksgiving dinner\nSchool well sort of make well that's impressive that was like a forty hour week we'll think of all the job brains that were there and you get to be the editor says that's pretty good or if you have to fight for that I Know I had to be talked into it oh is that right [laughter] 'cause I was about\nTo get married and had to marry me and my junior and senior year and I thought who they're going to be very hectic care if I'm editor of the paper in my first year of marriage\nIs a little bit marry him a wonderful woman how did you meet up\nBlind date at pass or she was a pass or studying Greek I was at Yale studying history and the arts and others in Europe my roommates monitor at a sort of a mixture came back and he sent out a way of saying that got us you've got to meet her and\nI didn't even have set up a day for me actually uh went over my a jeep to Vassar which was a a hand me down white sheep when the big red star on the side this is Nineteen fifty seven out too long after McCarthy I'm Russian jeep\nFrom a New Haven from New haven to the Harvard\nTo ... and we called up to a room and it's like my dad were going out and drink and you know you should meet this guy and she ... she had some paper and doing it and she looked out the window and she said I saw this funny looking car jeep with a Red Star I thought that guy must be interesting\nSo that's how she at least came on the day and um I started during the Vassar every weekend for two years I'm lost and when she graduated a year ahead of me I thought she was\nCame on the day and um I started during the Vassar every weekend for two years I'm lost and when she graduated a year ahead of me I thought she was going to go to ... be an archaeologist\nAs out of if she goes to increase its summer I'll numbers here again I better ask her now to get married he Christie at our parents were were very cooperative up that helped us to pay the rent first year Ninety dollars a week\nMonth I didn't Ninety dollars a month on our for fourth floor walk up in New haven right across from the Yale art gallery in about a half a block from the elderly and so we had a strategic location\nIs yeah the great fun I'm going into a morning class sneaking into literally into morning class with a man named Bernard Knox is a great classical philosopher teaching and yell at the time reading Greek plays using the grapes you learn to Vassar and it was a real idyllic first year\nThat he knows that she was a ringer\nOh sure oh have everyone else was men that were like well there are no girls at Yale that this was Nineteen uh fifty nine sixty\nWho else was prominent we've come to know today you know I Know that Bush is where they're at different times who was there when you were there that you could name\nWhile the future president ... ... less Aspen became a congressman congressman and then a secretary of defense and it was in my class they've been Hoboken roommate became a head of a marsh the clown insurance company in in the U.S\nLooking back on you how is it your sense that it's an elitist institution which trains the best and brightest in the country\nWell at the latest in the sense that it's very hard to get into its meritocracy though today if you or you can have an income up to I think it's a hundred thousand dollars and go free of charge tuition for they have such a huge dominant yellow he's been good about that\nWell and good but in recent years even better it wasn't until the last five years that this kind of need blind admissions was taken up by the ivy league some of the links that could afford it so now it's it's a it's almost the roulette wheel of people who all have eight hundreds and their SAT exams math and English\nAnd have done well in the writing\nAnd uh they turned down more people with the eight hundred and accept\nOr something like twenty two thousand people apply and they accept for the freshman class about a thousand so this is true at Harvard to him as a shoe\nBut what do you make of that I'm not being critical I mean what do you make of that you think that that's healthy I mean that there aren't people who are very aggressive who'll do very well who never would approach anything like an eight hundred score and well in like\nObviously that's Joe ... not everybody running the world is so much to Yale or Harvard\nWhat Mary and I discovered living in small newspaper towns are my early life was working in Danbury, Connecticut Strasburg, Pennsylvania paper that we had their ten thousand or can I have is the editor twenty five Middletown New York and New Bedford Massachusetts\nWas that in every case there was a community college or state college like turning into a nearby and Mary ... courses and she always found great teachers who are as good as people she had an ... I had an yeah who just didn't happen to have the have published three great books\nThat you have to have you know you have to publish or perish if you're going to be teaching at Harvard or Yale\nPrinceton arrest or even oop all these days yes or no go demanded that pressures on a that's a good point pressures on scholars everywhere who in teaching but we learn the basic fact that there's so many great teachers in America\nThat there are many good colleges were which may not have the greatest you know I mean the reputation\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I no joke no poll dog harness that did to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nAnd a much more attention paid to the student which I liked about yeah they're teaching there was much more important than ever it wasn't hard to better place to be here for the student\nSo loaded [laughter]\n\nAnd then you have to win the roulette wheel came\nWell you've been I don't want to take your cracked but you've been wonderful Sunni new polls you live in Naples but you bring a scholar every year to teach there and a lecture series and you've been extremely supportive why\nWell you can see that I think er an education is really important for everybody and then there are many bright students coming from so many new fault for many other places in the country who do well and make major contributions\nOr be really good citizens you don't have to run the world to be in and out to be important in a democracy everyone is important and everyone should be as educated as possible it's curious as possible about what's going on is interested in listening to the news on NPR and I mean I Am saying is\nTo be good citizens it's a we have to educate everyone or you can we can function in a democracy\nWell I asked that because you know every once in a while I'll talk to somebody and let's see what did you spend your career teaching in say new false and they'll say\nThe [laughter]\nOh [noise] you know I Love\nThat institution that assignment they're ignorant is yes it is I Love that institution there are many good teachers and that really first rate people yeah it's great to town to limit to because they make it a lively place\nGym on away what's happened to newspapers I was so struck as you spoke about your father is philosophy of acquisition and he was there at the right time obviously we're in the glory days of newspapers right now we have something else going on can you tell us about what's happening\nOf the biggest the some numbers that hits you in the eye and when you talk about what's happened to the newspaper business ten years ago two thousand to all the newspapers in America there are about one thousand four hundred had total advertising revenues of forty four billion dollars\nWas bigger than almost any other advertising stars ten years later two thousand twelve\nThere's been an implosion an advertising in huge decline last year two thousand twelve the total ad revenues and check this within his paper advertising bureau or twenty two point six billion twenty two point six billion almost exactly half what they were ten years ago\nAnd that's in use ... ... dollar dollar because we know that the dollar's worth\nMight and outs of enjoyed a dollar ... like I was even tougher the result is there are about thirty three by the third fewer reporters in America than there were ten years ago\nI think this is a disaster for our society sure I can talk about that one out because fewer public bodies are being covered by reporters\nWhen I was a kid a reporter and in Middletown Nineteen sixty two and one night I Would cover a school board in Chester zoning board in Florida and um maybe a planning board and worried and sending you know short stories of people would know what's going on in their town\nUh now the many of these ... just don't get covered and I'm used to sit in the courthouse in her in Goshen I remember covering my first double murder trial I sat there for about a week covering a murder trial was great stories great company and all that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hardest dot com I choke no poll dog hornets in that did to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nLos Angeles times like I used to have a thousand four hundred New York times has a thousand people and senatorial staff earned Arthur Sulzberger talking about this by the way he's the Hudson Valley resident who knows if it's on the weekends comes up the rock climb\nAnd get away from all the devastation of a of the newspaper newsrooms\nIs has a ripple effect into our society that most people most people don't realize because it means there's fewer people doing the original reporting on the scene\nAnd um while the Associated Press says uh makes up for that to some extent in Albany and\nDoesn't cover mental town just can't we don't have a you have to look to the local newspapers were during his weekly newspapers continue to do this\nQuite well as a kind of an inverse ratio of economic decline smaller the paper the healthier to his financially the bigger until you get to the New York times\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\n... in a liberal city like New York city I think he sees that as a kind of a mission he has he's interested in ideas in politics as well as making money\nHe got into terrible trouble in Great Britain to the point that you know his subordinates of arrested you know taking in all the rest of it but that has not jumped the pond as we say has that trouble\nAnd I wonder whether some day\nThere is a for a company like News Corp which is I'm legally in a American Company based in New York is subject to the foreign corrupt practices act you know I think sooner or later something's got to come up or you think would have to come up\nChallenging the company from the inside of the pond because of the truly horrendous things that has people on there and their papers did and in London you know threatening people with stories if they didn't give him the news about other people\nYou know really nasty stuff paying the police for stories before someone else got them things we wouldn't think of doing in America and so far no one's found the New York post going to happen you wonder how how they're\nWell the late ... corporation owned the British papers I'm as American corporation and then I I agree with you set it in a number of times wouldn't stand to reason that the corrupt foreign act would take ... wouldn't have happened already is my question\nOr is he just too powerful to take on nobody wants to do it\nThat's a possibility and the other thing is it's not politically popular thing to do and the other possibility is that they're waiting to see the outcome of the court cases ... years and then they'd have an even stronger case maybe\nYeah so I wanted to say there's another side to you and that other side is that you have a lot of interests you're an environmentalist I Know that and you have an interest in something called storm king one feels that\nWell the storm hang on center has had its fifth anniversary in two thousand ten\nIt's one of the top two or three\nOutdoors sculpture garden a museums of modern sculpture and the world you know it's really ... world class place of where the unique beauty of it is that you're seeing large outdoors sculpture some endorsement mostly large large in some small\nOutdoor sculpture in a beautiful landscape that incidentally was created by moving a lot of earth up to make the New York thruway that goes right but I see there's a sign that says Don King art center as you go north right as you pass it and that was that he had just got up last year\nSo it's really a unique place when my wife and I were living in Goshen when we moved there in Nineteen Seventy when I when as part of the purchased by Dow Jones of our family company I had to become president of the other way newspapers income I was part of that hostage and that

some of his works are going to be shown in San Francisco this may just got a lot of money to run a place like that\nIt does about the money takes a lot of fundraising thank God we have artists and collectors are interested in the first the first the artist are interested in showing there because it's like a one of the great stages for public outdoor heart\nThey'll often work with us for a lesser feed and they would somewhere and to a private collector because they're getting a huge benefit from all the publicity but even more important Peters turned over the years and John now\nAnd David Collins the artistic director of the storm king for thirty five or thirty six years work with Peter stern although all those years\nThey will bring someone like Richard Sayre since I we went like you to do a piece for first started working the way he would work with him because he did work with Richard Sayre and also when as I Move around a Gucci\nWas to walk to the land and let the
