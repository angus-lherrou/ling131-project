South Carolina camp outside of Spartanburg said was known as the time as the ... century camp in the country\nBeautiful place but I mean is hell when you say mean how many times can you tell us something of that yeah well it slipped when I got there to slip the third place and they brought in a new commander whose job was to bring it back up the first place as the meanest you mean yes as tough as strict and um\nHe went too far the other way so far the guys were ended up in the hospital he was actually burning the guys out and just it was just thinking I see a nice\nYou were a young Jew and yet in the south [laughter] I've heard a lot of stories about how that was was it was it different\nIt was different and I had been in the south before on the road with a band right so I had already been indoctrinated everything being black and white\nAnd I got thrown off a bunch ones because I like to sit in the back of the busing bus driver threw me off [laughter] and we had a few words besides so I Wish I knew about that I never had any problem a method to as a Jew and the army maybe because uh\nI was good as anybody else in the area was a wire every\nHot tempered character myself and uh I had one incident at the cost to street after that I just never had any problems after that was a it was one fellow was real\nNice guy from Alabama who had never met a true before in his life and this is kind of strange strange to me\nAnd when his wife came to the camp to visit he broke his neck getting us together and the explaining ... heard that this guy is a Jew\nStreaming support for

problems so you're a trumpet player has yeah and you had to audition to get into James he picked fellows union didn't Oh yes indeed and how does that work I mean you you went down down there and they tested you didn't\nYeah back in those days are they too were I think there were a little harder on me because of my brother but I sat in front of the three guys and they just kept throwing stuff on the music stand and you cite read it off you play it that's it theoretically\nThey say if you carry your union card you should be able to go to any kind of a job and play any kind of a music because you're a professional and that's the reason for it\nSo here you are a very fine trumpet player your brother was in Harry James is banned yet rich and you met her games oh yeah nice to nice guy and a new now drafted did you ever think that they might use you in an army band\nWell when I was drafted you take a bunch of tests and after the chest I was sitting in front of the sergeant and he was going through my papers and he said are you did very well on these test you can do almost any job you want in disarming I should I Would like to get into a band [noise]\nAnd he said they're all closed I said well uh ... what do I do now he says well you can be a builder that'll keep your neck like\nI said fine put me in a zip uber you see this was actually a very stupid move because on your part oh yeah yeah because I really didn't know that if you were in World War two was your scout and message center runner how really that's not a good job to have\nDid you do Los ... or unraveling\nEnough I was kind of lucky I didn't touch the horn during basic training because you're bringing with you know I don't know I didn't bring it with me 'cause I didn't know what was going to happen\nAnd we were sent to the specialist side of the camp so the first seven weeks you'll get the infantry training you're supposed to get in fourteen weeks\nAnd then the next seven weeks you're supposed to go and learn the code converter and Mr center where and how to scout and all this other stuff or after the first seven weeks they said you have a ... for a weekend to go to town\nBut on Monday we start to seven weeks over again because they need rifleman overseas they don't need special rush so it took a few days to gather the troops who went over the hill right\nBecause of that first seven weeks was a killer so I don't regret it because I was flying to and I was hired as a rock and I did everything an inch think and it really helps me when I got into the eye and her up and show\nWell not jumping ahead too far but you saw a lot of guys die in that and that actually live right next to you right now all our platoon had a Seventy five percent turnover whoa\nWe'll Richard and I think I should point out that we're talking to Richard Mara which who for one of the better description is the man who found Hitler's hat and who took revenge on that hat and that story is coming up as we go further so now they send you over right I mean you've just\nTo say I think there's a high percentage of choosing I end up with two of the twenty eight men three were Jewish herb Herman should Schaffner in me and none of us ever had a problem\nI listen to them with a twenty eight guys who got jeeps and who went to find the enemy to recall pixilated if you're just joining us at that come back and report where the enemy was but to engage the enemy or just supposed to look at them you're supposed to engage\nWell yeah well I mean you find them and sometimes they find you before you find them you know you've come out of the woods or on the road and you make a little turn on the road and then they on somebody's firing at you you know she's just happens that way should was or was it a kooky guy but dead serious\nIt was like one solid group that uh there were no weak spots now you had a German and your platoon oh French I had to go back to the CPA to pick him up he came over as a ... a command post [laughter]\nI had to pick him up he was a replacement so I've gotten a jeep went to the command post and a bunch of guys on a two and a half ton truck and I called out to Fritz crank color\nAnd this guy came out of this truck\nHe looked German he sounded Germany still had a little accent\nHis father got them out of Germany at the end I mean the ... after that the doors really playing chef so he went to the states she went to school um it wasn't a German Jews the German German yeah German and\nHe's got drafted in center back we needed guys like him because he was a great interpreter so I picked him up on a jeep going back to the platoon he should to me what am I supposed to do I have family here I have\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nFridge don't worry about things happen naturally over here [laughter] oh don't worry about it now so I'm the next day we get into a skirmish\nThe Germans have is pretty well pinned down hollering for us to give up popped up gay but and and the fridge didn't know what the hell do first he dropped his weapon\nGetting out of the jeep I had a forty five which I wouldn't wish on anybody I didn't want to have a French what was wrong with the forty five to forty five automatic you couldn't hear the bright side of a bar [laughter] I'll tell you the truth I fired at the brush started up a barn and missions [laughter] actually half\nDejected from the side and it was such it kicked your arm you know way over to the side and and um I picked up a German Lugar\nThis was a gorgeous beautiful will machine magnificent weapons where'd you get it off of the German that didn't need it anymore and if you and if you take ... votes to OU Idaho thing holster has a couple of extra clips couple of extra grips in a\nGreat piece of work and somebody in my wife's family was undergoing business for a while and he paid a visit one day and I should take a look at somebody if it's any good\nHe says it's phenomenal he broke it down\nAnd you know those things are hand their hands in their hand finished that was a\nLugar's and departure all numbered and all the numbers matched he says this is a great place he says you don't lose this he says if you get rid of it get a lot of money for it so um it was great that I don't give away you know that is\nBut after we got through it you will the getaway jeep took off and came back with\nYou you jumped ahead won the getaway huh the last jeep and the line is called the ...\nThey are driving down the road there are several how many ... twenty eight men seven seven James and the last guy school to get away get why\nBecause if I mean the first jeep usually what you know gets the problem the from the beginning of the column or that's where the lieutenant rides and I'm no\n... no no no most of the time to return it is with us I see most of the time believe it or not we don't even operate full strips we operate to squads three jeeps twelve men in each squad\nUnparalleled roads and the lieutenant follows behind keeps in touch with ... by radio and follows as we've given the grid coordinates and all this other stuff and he knows approximately where we are\nAnd if he gets a call from somebody else because he's got the big radio to six Ninety four from headquarters that or something else should be looked at and he'll swingers but we've we get into Jim ... whether it's a squad or whether it's the whole platoon\nThe last cheapest called a getaway jeep and\nThat jeep generally can get away and go back for help so in this case\nTo get away she took off came back with a rainbow rangers and together we were able to wipe out the machine gun shy and whatever else was around and that same day I was in the morning that same day we get into this village they didn't give us too much trouble\nThere were a few snipers around push arrested a village where it was a very small village and Fritz was running up and down the\nStreet crying and screaming and German calling them everything you could think of and I'm from that day from that day on Fritz was not bashful he would shoot at anything that moves relatives are not so\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nCorruption as you speak to us you don't speak in the past tense you speak in the present tense so I don't know if you've ever noticed that but you're saying that evidence in other words instead of saying we used to we did you say we and then you use the present tense we've fire it than we do this\nWhat is that you know there are ... are you still was it had second impact that it is still present for you um maybe some things but I don't think all all of that job but these are you know you you just can't possibly forget um how that you can these guys I bet you can't so\nNow here you are and you're advancing food Germany and uh I'm interested in something I've heard a lot of stories over the years about not taking prisoners about ss men who you\nFound in essence man or people found as men and they killed I once had a music teacher who would tell me some of these stories from the infantry\nIs itself it happened not with everybody and not not all the time it happened on occasion\nEverybody ... you know talks about atrocities like we never cause any you know which is nonsense if you are you go ahead and you draft\nMillions of guys and you train them to kill some of them would have been killers if you didn't draft him and train them in the first place [laughter] now you're giving them the ammunition and the equipment you\nKnow some guys you're just a fraction off their rocker show you put them in in in a situation where they can do damage um\nWho's controlling it show there were atrocities on both sides nowhere near what the Japanese chairs or nowhere near what the Germans did maybe button there were things that happened\nWe were able to differentiate between the common German soldier and a stopover ss person\nOh it was a huge difference in the regular German soldier to very much they were like gosh they didn't want to be there either so [laughter]\nBut the S. S. were impossible\nThey were just absolutely impossible and they try to get away with stuff too and if I'm if an ss men step that align most of the guys wouldn't hesitate you mean after they were captured yeah do we tell you to do period and ... and they say but at ... let me give you\nBack a little bit because people tune in and out and I just want to announce that we're talking to Richard ... who's an American soldier from the intelligence and reconnaissance with two of the rainbow division during World War two\nBut he's gained some fame as the man who found Hitler's happy not to trivialize that at all because the rest of your experiences may have even been more important than this highly symbolic thing which happened then we're getting there\nNow you're moving ahead in Germany\nIs some dramatic things happened what were some I think the most dramatic or was um concentration camp and not something you knew nothing of right no no no no no\nLittle villages had three or four\nPrisoners who they use to clean the streets and all that stuff mhm some camps are cold there were hundreds if not thousands of sub camps that we ran across those are who are those prisoners Jewish or China in Greek um\nOr maybe even German surely Israel's labor labor really she actually of labor they even had the striped uniforms as the same as they had in the concentration camps but there were relatively good\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nForty five now we're pretty close to the end of the war which was you know they may do you know that you're getting close to end the war when we had a pretty good idea because things were getting a little easier and we're getting more prisoners used more easily\nPeople who are sort of falling and yeah I've heard stories that a lot of those prisoners wanted to make sure they were taken by the Americans and not by the Russians the investment\nOh yeah oh yeah because the Russians were knocking 'em off like crazy we weren't anywhere near that area of the guys who are\nCloser to Berlin you know closer to where the Russians were ... you know more about that than I Would because we didn't come in contact with the Russians really should but one very early in the morning we were shook out of\nBed in and brought into the command post and um there were two German soldiers there and they gave us new maps and they said these two Germans were recently over the road from where we are to jacko\nThat she will [laughter]\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nWe run into any trouble is a bunch of guys going to jump up on white arm bands there on our side we've got to set up I said okay well we went in we heard a shot every now and and but there was no no real resistance no problem but it was it was on the other hand it was very\nEerie blue or the other Americans in there before you\nKnow buddy we were the first ones in no kidding just love of his well now the bridges were blown I forgot the name of the river that goes through Munich a there was one Bridgette wasn't blown and that was a foot bridge just wide enough for a cheap to go across and you had to go up a lot of steps [laughter]\nYeah like the steps in front of the Capitol in Washington\nTo get to the bridge so we put the ... in four wheel drive low low and we went up the steps across the bridge and down the other side and we got to Hitler's house and we've been down to the door and finally this tall stately woman with pepper and short hair\nCalling us from rough eons\nShoes and wanted to know what everybody's why everybody was so mad and Mr Hitler he was such a fine man so herb shed rich I'm throwing her down and he is another word I Can't use in between there just stares and um\nI should forget about it let us do we have to do and get the hell out of here so we are in it's a different rooms or by the way\nIt is an apartment house it was it was it how it\nWas it was a an apartment really it was a I don't think it was quite a like maybe a townhouse not even a town I was more than an apartment I it was nothing classy about at all do this is the place where he met with Chamberlain and all of the other big shots\nAh this was his favorite place to Munich was his home just as you know this was this\nThis this is where he was comfortable to furniture was plain but rich I mean he stole the best there's no two ways about it but it wasn't or ... or ... or anything like that everything was there the pictures were on the wall so I ran into a bedroom and I didn't know which is although the furniture was great\nAnd I pulled open all the drawers and they were empty and I went over to the closet which was empty and I saw something dark on an upper shelf so I dragged over a chair climbed up cut this gorgeous had looked inside saw age now this is a top hat top hat\nShop at ... H pictured is heading had showed on the floor jumped off the chair on the hat and stops at too about when it was about\nEight or nine inches high it ended up about three quarters of an inch high have you ever regretted that moment of something I had no no as a matter of fact you're angry owing more than that\nAnd then afterwards after I realized you know still but it was um when I walked out at a room with his hat on strutting around\nAnd I didn't remember it as either Herman Herman reminded me of this joined a little stick on of\nCharlie Chaplin doing a Hitler Hitler I don't remember it but that's what hurts it I guess so I Believe her the whole day was a strange day you know of course shortly after that the rest of the troops came in and uh that was the end the Munich\nRichard you've been quoted many times is saying that you think you may have indirectly been responsible for Hitler suicide I Know what you go but could you tell us about\nYes sometime after I got to ... somebody said to me what about to go incidents of view stumping on Hitler's hat on April thirtieth\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nFive the same day that Hitler and Eva Braun his girlfriend committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin and I should naturally when he heard that some skinny Jewish kids stumps all over his favorite heck he committed suicide and which do it ...\nWell I put it in my duffel bag word got around and it finally reached division headquarters by this time the war was over I was wondering if that was part of it\nAnd finally reach division headquarters and I'm just like two or three weeks after the war was over and as a photographer for division photographer showed up at regimented headquarters company and\nInquired who is not that had had and they pointed to him and me and he uh uh I was in the house that we took over for our bullets and he took the picture me with a hat on\nAnd which ended up in the division history book and that's pretty strange too because for years for fifty some odd years\nPeople were looking in the division history book and seeing this picture of this cuckoo with Hitler's head on they didn't know if this had with a hat on for the head with a cold ... knows\nFor those who are listening simulated Charlie Chaplin and you know the little dictator looking you looked like Hitler yeah the ... the ones that in ...\nMustache and they didn't know what the picture was doing in the book because they forgot the caption it ... and it wasn't until\nNineteen Ninety five actually\nWhen I went to a reunion reunion that year was in Seattle is there any and every year every year and nobody machines if they can if they can get their anyhow like Howard is on oxygen twenty four hours a day and he comes to every ... really yeah and it comes with an oxygen tank no you you can't bring your own oxygen onto an airplane\n... brings them to the airplane with the accident and he has to hook into the airplanes oxygen Denny has to have to call the head make all the arrangements ahead\n... ... where every child he's in for example Seattle some oxygen and play some Seattle has to meet him at the plane and hook 'em in and let me ask you go to the hotel where they have already delivered all the oxygen bottles of the knees but he would not miss every will not miss you know will you\nUnfortunately I've been getting um in contact with a son he's been having you've been very sick for the last\n... months he's been in and out of the hospital in his last three weeks he's been in the hospital and so\nHe is in bad shape but he's a hell of a guy\nSo you're in possession of Hitler's that did not last question I've always been interested in since I found out about you did the army have any feelings about people taking things like Hitler that\nWell if they did they didn't say anything [laughter] I'll tell you first of all I don't know if anybody um I Know the division headquarters and do it and I know all I got to do it but but everybody's got souvenirs and nobody tried to muscle and the only thing you had to do\nIt would have been different if you took a van Gogh off the wall right\nWell you know I Know some guys with that too [laughter] well let me put it this way general Harry James Collins yeah from Howard I received a he was our division commander I received a um\nOh by the way after the war never came back to the states who did general heritage a column no kidding of the rainbow division yeah and I never knew why accepted he did marry a German woman okay but that's still snow excuse correct\nBut Howard sent me an article out of out of a mid western newspaper about Harry James Collins\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThings had taken over two or three castles on the rhyme\nIn different areas and the ... when they went into the castles they found all his artwork that nobody could ever find that he had stashed in these castles he dead he's that\nThat's always his wife or and what are the guys went to Europe last year and he's he brought me back a picture that he took of we call them Hollywood Harry 'cause he wanted a scarf and all that [laughter]\nAnd ah of his grave I says I really didn't do shit [laughter]\nBut now you've found Hitler's hack mhm and you have used it first of all the Jewish war veterans exhibit in in Washington they voted for a couple of years right yeah and they told you to hold onto it as I remember the story because because what\nOh what it was supposed to go down I I received a call from the museum and they said don't send that down yet\nBecause some skinheads walked into the museum and she had been on ... searching three local channels or the night that we had the little ceremony get the Jewish community center at one time when he was at\nWhere I was officially M. lending the hat to the museum of museums and show all the three channels showed up show the ... the skinheads the Nazi organizations to far right they all have\nTheir own sophisticated everybody owns computers you know and I'm sees a skin has walked into the museum and we should we should we understand that you have something coming down from Albany New York and so the museum said we're going to beef up security been rebuilding a special case for your head\nOr so waiting to recall you that it's all done before you had to do that and then they did it and did you go down to watch the I went down I went down for the opening of the the new exhibits that it was part or people interested in it\nUh yeah I kept getting called first they said they wanted for three or four months and then they said they do we hold it a few more months and then you just kept going on until till two years were up\nAnd the reason was that he kept it attracted so much attention they said they never had any single item that got the attention more than the ... of it\nNow you use his hat in other ways you've used it in education you've got around schools", "city": "Albany"}
