I guess that means you're playing the role of the person who is not excited about this baseball season I'm a ...\nAbout everything current you know [laughter]\nLet's take it away I'm super excited about the red Sox which made being in the press box when they claim strictly I got\nGot to bad luck by like couldn't watch for the end of the ninth inning 'cause I was so nervous and I was freaked out and they want and I was like this is wild [laughter] ... no one like that\nDid you on cork champagne around\nIt was like cracker jacks and wind up in the air and the ... um no but I think\nYou know I Would super invested in in the LDS as I think a lot of people were because you know Yankees Red Sox first time meeting in the postseason since two thousand and four when I was also really invested but what was interesting to me about the series is that I went into it assuming that every fan would be judged for the rivalry and\nYet when I went to send way and Yankee Stadium also I found that fans weren't as dedicated to hating the other team as I expected them to be\nDo you think that part of the issue I mean besides the fact that the dragon was slain mouser for but also the red Sox and the Yankees these current teams are kind of a likeable didn't have enough jerks the red thought out and yeah you need more jerk for that rivalry to be really a food\nNo change in that exactly what people said at Fenway they were like we don't have the same characters you know there's there's not a lot and not to like\nAbout a lot more for\nGoing in a locker room and I get yelled at by Yankees PR trying to talk to them and judges like sorry like he was very nice about it All right Jason what do you think\nI think the Houston Astros fares are going around dogs they were so annoyed that they had

wanted to have roosters [laughter]\nI'm not even going to pretend Karen I'm I'm a Homer\nBut Jason what you just said about being said is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like their new and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nWhere a lot of never satisfied Karen hadn't they go you\nRealize care and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox play more if I was just it it and they have waited long enough\nFor children All right so I Want to move out of New England and talk about Jenny butler he had an exciting return to let it simmer whole practice on Wednesday\nButler's looking for a trade and to facilitate a trade he reportedly played brilliantly during practice wealth screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't be on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me and my finest numerous sure that's what they're going to get inside the lines\nAnd I was gonna say is it not the right way for it to come to think it was the wrong thing to do well okay thing to do I think that\nI was on okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do what I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes\nBut as frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids are going to do what you do\nSo it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK\nCharlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when the NBA\nAdventures ensue WW story so I'm not going to let you get them or you know we do a little concerned about ...\nAbout my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler new exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like\nMan but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on timber wolves campus for this melt down with advanced

don't know if you are one of the ... stone\nYou know this is where the NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like the marvel comics universe where these

Sixers centered July al indeed had signed a five year deal with Under Armour it'll making the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote\nThere is a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that because she's look really weird and aside Seventeen\nYes I mean speaking as someone who bought\nAt a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on which I Believe we're using as a car for [laughter] the problem with what they looked fine on the big men right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey look like art auction [laughter] but if anybody can do it it's Joelle envied who has charisma beyond belief um so I mean he's going to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway he thinks of itself a guard I mean you might as well think of his own as a Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is\nYeah I mean he said I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but he thinks he can do at all which I guess means he can shoot the coaching staff of the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers to just add a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked you yes\nWhat shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm or the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bribe big enough to make me care about this bribery trial it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is

the real victim here the prosecutor say the victim is the university's fans might say at us but the New York times suggests that it's Bryan tags Boeing whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia and\nWell there's nothing wrong with playing in Australia certainly has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian balloons going to be fine I think he's going to do was apprenticeship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high\nBut again the fact remains is the whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized by these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on the show we learned that the woman who is accusing event it's darker the honor and all the freight had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document in which we're now although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow we're in all the lawyer is saying that document was acquired in the computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the eight thousand reasons why I didn't go to law school I think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove that thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden\nOtherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr and all those who is capable of buying a lot of forensics\nYou've written a lot and your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is you know you're out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents\nI really get confused about what can we ... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean it's a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instinct and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just fanning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nInstead they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our diversity officers understanding what you did wrong and this time isn't going to be spent in a
