Carrying given and it's time for three stories you should know we're going to start this week by analyzing a new scientific\nStudy I'm not joking but I promise that will be fun I'm joined by Michael leave the athletic and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you both like severe thank you Karen [noise]\nSo I don't normally follow the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked at the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits\nAnd football would have been ranked number one for psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and I'm all questions and answers and nor a what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play it in high school high school football scares me ... just because all the research shows that when your brain is younger thoughts when it's the most vulnerable and the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that\nThe psycho social benefit seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nWell I I don't know if I have an issue at high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner like yeah like really little kids\nBut I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community and you have the whole town behind you you know I Know from my years from cover in high school football I Know just what that sport can do to just\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com a no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\n... if you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that for run across the country [laughter] but football I can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been ... in jest that kids under fourteen ... plays flag football and sad that they don't really need to\nTell 'em in there with that yeah and I'm totally ... and yeah yeah yeah and\nYou know Tom rainy and demanding none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football flag football like would would that would that community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for a risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help with that [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution paid\nLeave that the G League is a now offer an alternative to the in sees one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WNBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness everybody signed with an agent\nBut there is a risk to this one being you're playing in the ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself\nFrom your perspective as you say in college when you're playing against guys are on age also the G League does not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players but just allowing them to have the ability of the hiring agent to sell their likeness and assign shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the end of all ages\nSort of one day waking up in deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing cool facts\nProbably the best possible outcome from is right or at least as I see it would be\nThat the threat of\nElite high school players going to the G League instead of being one and done would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] uh I mean I think the only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is is\nThe alternative is a good enough one I can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G lead into the top\nStreaming support

developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday at Steve Penny the organization's former president did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common that we start the segment we both argument using true and for all the wrong reasons\nThis guy's on blue since the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy rant on sports organization right on the lam and they have to track them down any gallons burger and that that bringing back ... taxes\nA grand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing document do you\nAs does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either a disguise trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against you say ... we're going to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[noise] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was an which I never thought I Would do it again [laughter]\nRight right well she was announced last friday as USA Gymnastics a new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first that\nDoes the fact that means bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right and that question [laughter] the second issue to me as a bit more complicated\nIn September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker to blackout swoosh on her Gulf shoes\nAnd as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame\nI might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the memo in which Mary Bono somehow became qualified to run usa your true backing them all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you've alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport if really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that\nYou shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what the USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states and God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help itself\n[noise] Charlie you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised\nNo because we're smart Karen and more people should listen to it [laughter] no I mean the basic problem the NFL had with the whole anthrax thing was they got three or four owners who were off the reservation on Jerry Jones\nBombing narrow down in Houston a church singing and kill and those guys are print pretty much marginalize if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches and was cooler heads prevail\nOr they realized that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this\nStreaming support for WAMC comes

enough ice hockey players to field one team they had never played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news\nFirst of all I Want Jersey Jersey I so bad [laughter] apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play against the team of firefighters and then Crosby imaging and played for the gang [laughter]\n... which is the last story on our on our segment every week is usually a funny one which is in a funny one this is an author and McKinney even have you got you can't really put out which is pretty good considering most of them did skate before last year\nThere's a video because of course it's sponsored by a coffee company and my favorite but it's one of the Kenyan players reaches out and like pot Sidney Crosby on the face and said is it really you know [laughter]\nI've always been you can still hockey anywhere if you give it a chance you could sell hockey in Kenya I Hope the lions practice very hard and are in the
