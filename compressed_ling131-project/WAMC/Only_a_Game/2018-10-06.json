thank you and buy one of my very favorite investigative journalist you do not want her on your trail the terrific Jessica Luther Hi Jessica high you are up first this week Jessica what do we need to know\nYeah so Christie honor and all do the soccer superstar from Portugal who played for event isn't Italy is the third highest paid athlete in the world and possibly the most famous he has now also under investigation by the Las Vegas police department in regard to a two thousand nine reported sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward in a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten and all those settled with her out of court impaired three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the report it assault again\nBut she has a new lawyer who is trying to avoid that settlement on multiple legal grounds there the police investigation because she found a police report ended a rape kit back in two thousand nine the day after she said he raped her\nEarn although has denied these allegations but and they're reporting Spiegel says there was an internal document between her and all of his lawyers and which are NATO and met she said no\nThere may not be a bigger ... on the planet the all seeing is getting any traction\nWell I think that it should be getting some traction but given that the week that we've had and also not just the week but the year you're looking at Ohio State and Jessica of course the work you've done and Baylor and Kevin army and you wonder how you're going to keep your enthusiasm level high to we used to be paid closer attention\nI'm going to try to be optimistic and say that this was going to get the sort of traction that it needs and it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it I Wish I were more optimistic than I Am totally what do you think\nWould if we don't have the optimism mostly because uh we\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThis woman has every piece of that it's possible you have sponsors who are kind of backing away from all the way you have teams who are suspending him and giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be respected and so she her pain\nYeah and you've got Nike that's got a billion dollar endorsement deal with him by the way that is one billion for one player and of course\nA ... a sports has also said that they're monitoring the situation very closely just because this is the area that you trafficking when you saw Addison Russell get forty games were major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving it's a you know I always described us as like\nA giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult but you know for someone like me who studies college football and sexual violence in particular it wasn't much but urban Meyer he got a little bit of punishment but it it's going to take a long time and a lot of work to get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so in the last few weeks one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammate era greed was originally signed by the Carolina Panthers read isn't all pro level almost all world level safety at this point and was one of the main people who kneeled next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of mythology and also sexism and also racism and also everything bad in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David temper\nHas said that he sides of the protests that being said it doesn't feel as if the Panthers have done anything monumental by hiring at the center are hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL\nThey've done nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the cap on the air are finding their way back into the league for you guys think\nYeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you is that what we do here just to get my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism\nIn met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric read that collusion lawsuit that he's got currently against the NFL now goes away\n... does it get a question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player [noise] I'm\nGoing back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought that up um if we want to talk about the impact on me to on sports the fact that Richardson stopped there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his massage and racism that's right that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter] I don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that read it back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job got one\nAnd also having skepticism that it took this long for it to happen to the entire NFC alpha needed so they never happened in the first place why why are we waiting until October for this exactly agree with not on a preseason roster every was on the training camp roster it took ... mental fall and the gridiron for ... to even get proposed that he should have a job\nOr the general manager Marty hardly ... strictly a football decision and that's when they start to feel duplicitous like we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I Would want to point out that that has presser which was raped by the way the yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be used in classrooms and he's being very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nA Eric and I talked about this at linked to during the twenty Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to have to go head first on shaping us\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOr you and you're going to lose or what he did to me was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filtered through the following one's white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough the lens players perform a service for the owners and the entertainment ... they have no other rights or concerns they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful\nBut it'll Thomas the safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract and everyone knows the dangers of football the injury risk the short window of opportunity and the fans called him selfish\nAnd he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being cut it off the field he flipped the middle finger to his sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction wasn't to burnish Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\nWho got your Jersey money though [laughter] friends\nThere some way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about ah this story with JR Smith they came up recently in the NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and then all the question about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns a company that in quotes like who owns\nThe ... and what did they owe us Jessica sometimes but yeah refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah he was talking about them is owners the language of sports is very specific right\nI think the anger that comes with hearing some some of these decisions of the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right [laughter] you belong to the people who pay your paycheck and that's wrong at the basis of it right\nSo the NBA says they are with actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices he said the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand do my leg\nOr he says the money is more important to my kids what she did say I'm just going to keep pushing and so I think it's powerful that people like all Thomas and GR Smith are standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is if there's a lady on bill on the field as we've seen with the state was often\nOften doesn't do the team is bad losses recruit people get fired in that just because you wouldn't pay somebody their worst\nMy guess for this week's

carry sports nut LA\nWith the combination of court cutting in contempt you think people are realizing that life goes on or if you're just a die hard sports fan do you just wait forever until these corporations figure it out\nYeah I think both are true but I also think there is another phenomenon going on and that is the phenomenon of finding a way to be a fan without attending games that without necessarily watching on TV [laughter] I mean we always to be a financial betting but\nNow you can be a fan from fantasy sports you can be a fence memorabilia all kinds of ways to do what you

whole nature of college football change the thing about of Nebraska teams was up by people like Johnny Rogers and Tommy fresher they were big goons stay would beat you to death yep over the ... up and
