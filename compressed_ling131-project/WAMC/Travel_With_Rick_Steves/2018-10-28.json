so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like higher\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it seems to something larger the spirit\nIt bullied the spirits of the Irish who have left through the centuries of no choice of their own to make a living and other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the her role with people and pride of place every single little ... in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way

filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about off it's not the culture of celebrity that sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the June\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great song or tune it was there before us and it will be there after so we're just playing our part in continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear her

Carl good to have you back on the show\nThanks so much so did I said that Rockefeller story up correctly there\nYes no question I mean Michael graduated he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and\nWent off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called then a few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were\nIncredible ... and he determined to go to as Matt and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick ... sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and are on that trip he vanished\nSo Michael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one in your studying up this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to the his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nI think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was a young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around our you know the way I'm most

twenty four foot high a polls kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he you know got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd this is in New guinea this is a huge island down them between Thailand and Indonesia as one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics of that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road ... swamp\nIn the inner villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top and with the Dutch miner or thirty four year old anthropologist named Renee walk thing and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff\nAnd people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one as Matt was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence of which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an integral part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and\nMichael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world\nAnd he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nTime and you know you could be very wealthy and sophisticated but from a cultural point of view you could also be very naive and green venturing into society and well one of the great\nIronies of the story is that you know this is a man from who represents you know the most powerful family in the most powerful country in the world in and asked mad at a crucial moment he was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy empower and it's all about taking somebody's power and\nHead hunting and you know when the as Matt man who killed them did so they were taking back their power sort of a desperate bid to take power back that had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and Dutch efforts to pacify them and take away their culture and

aggressive or racist Dutch Colonial patrol officer went to the village specifically to teach the village a lesson as he wrote in his report since he\nWas afraid and he brought a lot of armed policemen with them and he arrived in to this village of ... which was a\nLegendary you know a traditional place a place that had resisted the incursions of the Dutch and didn't want to change its ways why should it why would want to\nHe ended up opening fire and killing five people and that left the village with a sacred obligation to you know everything was a ... I mean spiritually and it left the village with a sacred obligation to reciprocate the men's death than Michael kind of swim into that as it turned\nOut so he gave them the opportunity to reciprocate basically by stumbling into their world Pete did\nCarl Hofmann spin on assignment to more than Seventy countries has a report\nToday on travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he discovered about the plight of Michael the Rockefeller has he investigated his disappearance ended deadly clash between\nCultures in the jungles of New Guinea his book is called Savage Harvest [noise] now I I don't want I guess I'm focusing on kind of listen it's fascinating and apparently it's it's a reality\nBut I guess when these tribal people decide to eat a human being is not a matter of nutrition it's not like the Donner Party it's a matter of um power and symbolism\nIs that right yeah it's not like you know we're hungry let's go get a Big Mac or anything and it was easier to get an animal in that regard but you're just searching yourself by symbolic well I mean the ritual is theory somebody\nYeah it gets very complex but no cannibalism is with in a is a sacred act with in a complex Web of obligation and ceremony and customary laws and that has great meaning and important\nIs there a ritual a stick way to actually cook the person\nYes very much so which I won't go into a here but I Do in the book\nThe Rockefeller family maintains that their son was was not a victim of chemicals\nHe was actually on a boat crossing the mouth of a river that engine trouble and then flipped over and drifted and Michael said you know I think he violated the first law ... which is to you know never leave the boat as long as it's still flowed and he said I think I can make it and\nRenee wafting who was older and wiser said to you know if you go you're on your own I'm not leaving and Michael did and he swam away from the boat and he was never seen again\nAnd there was a massive search and of course Renee was rescued the following day by Dutch patrol planes there was a massive search for Michael you know Nelson and Michael sister Mary both went to New Guinea immediately and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "city": "Albany", "day": "28"}
