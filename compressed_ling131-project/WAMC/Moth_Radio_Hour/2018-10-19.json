in a wealthy\nSuburb I spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was

took her up to a field above a town go to a record\nAnd they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd when I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summer it's hot and the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails\nAnd that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front

more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat\nYou go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about bullets is that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sound the bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later\nYes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy the boy a\nBullet hit two inches from that side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right now what is the math on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting sandbags smacking and did everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof that\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up under the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington\nPhotographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap and he grabs stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest grabbed and stuff it's throwing a mode of soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand\nAnd I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war\nAnd I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness

that since I've read it at my dog Curtis dot com\nYour memory about this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of heal up So Tim took the next trip\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they dragged off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that same broke his life he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain my daughter we are going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that if you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty man you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it got down off the mountain\nSo we finished up our deployment and um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst is in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd if the the film did really well and started it started with the scene um that was very took me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came\nUm scene where I riding in a Humvee 'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\nOr riding in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee
