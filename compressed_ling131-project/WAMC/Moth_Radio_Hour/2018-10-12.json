thought my hair cut at this guy named Troy and Troy is the best okay he talked to me about sports about church you got to go see\nSo then that day when my dad picked me up I was like dad let's go

obsessed with the details of the wedding I thought it was an opportunity to show everybody should we were as a couple and not that we were just perfect for each other but we had perfect hate to\nSay I dived into research I was looking up it takes and notably backdrops and wedding dresses I was basically the reason contract with invent it [laughter] and after all my deep dives that was ready to go I started the invitation I hand embroider to every one of my wedding invitation\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill

Fields for a funny friend ...\nI may have some Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache if I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my wedding to pay like created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter] she actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the ... vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little ... for the twelve cakes we were going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so [noise]\nThere were things he cared about to\nMostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed it an orchestrated it and send it off to the bands and we got prepared for our big day going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but\nI what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which was my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years in the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his hometown in his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung olive the twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made play though I had done for the event\nNow when all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri it's tornado season\n[noise] I was\nActually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins into the shapes of swans when the tornado siren\nWent off and then came the rain and then the hail\nAnd wins and it knocked all of the table over and all of my beautiful center pizzas into the mud six months of making them every night and they were destroyed\nNo one saw any of it\nNow luckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way up but [laughter] we had invited all of these circuits people\nBut we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so up with the big top and we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm ready to begin\nThat it was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get into little card I made so we just proceed without her [noise]\nUm [noise] I was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack\n[noise] he's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot EDU in before\nSo she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me was that my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there\nI had to step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called him and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nI'm as only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter danced by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should've been and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise] all of our hamburger spiders just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm it finally passed by and he missed our friends singing a song from Britain to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\nAnd\nSo after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle policemen and the specialty cocktail I have made [laughter] which is just jak and coke\nBut [noise] in fact it was our\nAnd the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that\nWe shouldn't have gotten married\nThere's some things even cake can't fix [noise] maybe if I hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut even though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married in ... corps which literally translates to broken heart\nAnd my dad says now well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway but he did he missed a part of my life and\nHe also missed our friend I'm a meat loaf cover artist called pot roast um\nIt was also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage all all of our friends stamps and the pedals\nSo we missed a lot\nYou would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings I mean there are people who think their scam but I Love wedding I Love the details and stuff

spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner ... he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now\nHave this do you want to have a baby silence\nHe turns around and I see that he is laughing at me\nThis is the stupidest idea you've ever had\nNo I don't want to have a baby\nIn his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while\nI'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley and Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just trying to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby and I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nTo a baby\nThis isn't some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender ah for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person\nAnd I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy\nUm which is what I did um [noise]\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu [noise]\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\n\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not tramp he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything's who have given birth to happy beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah\nAnd I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer I'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nAh [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse any that pregnancy tests and then just made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant\nAnd there was going to be a baby you know so but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nHayley in while even toddlers when they came to live with us so I didn't know what to do with a baby and then my body started to change really quickly I'm\nAn all of those ah markers of femininity everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on to my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like this or my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the thing that it can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nUh in white around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out of trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes that there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there's also joy and love and and resilience and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone don't read that um [noise] CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there's a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trans um a lady once told me that she adopted her needs to and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve while also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... and ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly\nHarry woman and that I was going to give birth to a monster\nAnd then one woman sent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby [noise]\nBecause that baby will be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you\nI was six months pregnant when I read that message now I have been transfer a long time Fifteen Years\nI'm actually at age thirty five I'm I Am past the point of average life expectancy for a trans person in America today [noise] um I think that I'm resilient and and strong and and powerful",
