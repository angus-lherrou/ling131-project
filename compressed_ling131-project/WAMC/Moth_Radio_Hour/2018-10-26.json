visible [noise]\nI'm In all the years uh of living under my parents' roof I never broke a bone um my mother and father never one time had to take me to the emergency room and I strongly suspect that um we never had to\nUh buy a second box of band aids and the reason for that was pretty simple my parents were spectacularly protective\nAh and and Harvard over me to make sure that no pain or physical injury should occur\nI Lived in a state of New Hampshire but never set my feet into ski boats um I don't think a piece of athletic equipment ever crossed our threshold my\nMother made sure that I didn't enter the water for swimming until a full hour after eating and my father stood over me and brushed away the mosquitoes before they landed [noise]\nBut every night at six o'clock\nI'm he climbs the stairs to our attic and took out the vodka\nAnd through the night he drank and to paint and sometimes late in the night he some and to me to his addicts studio\nWhere he painted beautiful lyric landscapes of the British Columbia of his youth a painter and expanded to me with poetic eloquence on the sacrifice that he had made of giving up the life as an artist to be a parent [noise]\nUm and in the morning we never talked about it holidays were particularly stressful time in our family I'm with a particular amount of alcohol more than one Christmas my father ah through the tree across the floor\nUm my mother was gone surprisingly often and when she was it was left to me to hide the car keys [noise]\nAnd maybe because of that although I grew up to have the um the life of a certain level of artistic expression that heavy looted my two I'm enormously artistically gifted parents the goal that I found most elusive and wonderful was to be part of a happy family\nAnd I believe that my best shot of having happy relatives was to give birth to them [noise]\nSo I married quite young at twenty three an artist\nI'm and though I Would come to realize over the years that we had surprisingly little in common\nUm we did both share a passion uh creative passion although he was a painter and die with a writer I think we both felt that there was no a creative undertaking more thrilling and potentially fulfilling than to make and raise children and we got right to it\nUp silently and went into the kitchen the table was as always covered with art supplies [noise] and he took

was at\nA picture and then he made a little dot in the center like the picture was hanging on the wall and then my second grader wrote for his writer mother and his artist father the words\nLove is the best art of all\nAnd I think that was the moment that I knew [noise] the foolishness that's ever supposing that I could protect my children from pain and the folly of the ways that I had attempted to do so [noise]\nThat was sixteen years ago since then um many injuries have been incurred my children for many years traveled back and forth between our two houses with their belongings always and

how telling stories affect her writing\nI used to think of my writing is the kind of my you know my way of getting in the back door and what I really wanted to be which was up on a stage connecting with an audience um and actually although I Love what I Do and I feel really extraordinarily lucky to have gotten to do to do this all the years that I have\nUm my one complaint about being a a writer for the page it's that I don't get to see\nAnd hear the response of a reader to my work I'm so at the mouth I did and I could hear people laugh and I could hear people gap sometimes um\nI also learned a lot I could feel when I can feel when you're losing somebody you can feel when you need to pull them back\nUm it it's it's a very immediate form of storytelling that actually has informed my writing for the page as well and not just my my memoir writing but but absolutely my fiction\nWe talked about how rarely writers get to experience firsthand the reactions of their audience back\nA million years ago when I was a reporter in New York City I remember one time riding the subway to Times Square and seeing somebody open up the New York times with a story that I had written and I was looking over her shoulder and I was so excited to watch her reading\nThat's so cool guy and I'm sure the person reading it would have died as she knew she was the next city off [laughter] I don't know I think there are probably greater thrilled and her life but\nBut for me um to be able to hear laughter that most of all to hear laughter\nPart of what makes you are writing so really it is your willingness to be vulnerable like very open on the page did you feel even more vulnerable on stage with direct experience with the audience\nThe more willing you are to to expose your flaws and failing I Would just say you're humanness the the more you will the more I Will relate to an audience moral audience will relate to me\nSo I wanted to ask for listeners who I Know what to do it just is how ... how are your children doing give us an update well ... it's\nPretty easy to locate them I'm One of them appears on a on TV every every Tuesday night at a heartthrob I'm a bad boy with the heart of gold my

Kentucky\nAnd sometimes you took my brothers and I with her\nAnd at the end of a very long day my father would come home he would put his briefcase down and then he would have wished my mother a on a a a tango down the hallway they went to all the way down and then they would turn and they would go all the way back up as the three of us watched it was awesome\nAnd then we would we would have

the United states on it and it had the capital of each state marked I loved his best friend but I I think it was probably the last time that I cared about geography [noise]\nSo after we ate breakfast we got into the car all in our designated seats my father and the driver's seat my mom and the passenger seat my older brother to my left my younger brother to my right and we drove from Fort Knox Kentucky to Greensboro North Carolina to visit my father's parents my grandparents\nBut at one point on the trip my mother said that she wanted to take a nap so she took off her seat belt and she sort of nestled herself and her seat and I said I wanted to take a nap to so I turned around I'm going to straddle the hump in the back of the Cadillac and I put my head down on the seat and went to sleep\n\nThe next thing that I remember is a there was a screech and scream and a crash and we had been in a really terrible terrible car accident\nSo remember I was six years old and my only contact for car accidents was television so what I remember is if we had a musical soundtrack the music was gone and what was replaced was\nA heavy breathing and it was in slow motion and as I lifted my head and I looked to my left I was facing the back I looked at my little brother who is trying to catch his breath which is probably the heavy breathing I heard and I looked in front of me in the car had been split in half we're kind of we hit in the bank meant\nSomebody that hit us um and then I looked at my older brother and he had blood on his forehead and then I kept turning around and I looked into the front seat of the car I saw my father still in his seat belt unconscious lying on the seat\nAnd then the dashboard the center of the car with also split in half and on to the right of the dash of the split and the dash there was\nBlood and teeth and above that\nA crack in the windshield and a little bit of blood there as well and I kept turning to the right and my mother was
