emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them\nBecause I was born and raised in Manhattan Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and ah and tiny bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brother to take turns massaging his back\nWhile I'm\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\n[noise] and\nSo I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China and I asked\nWho every rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rockets right but\nI found my way to figure out does identity issue when I was Thirteen I was\nExcited to watch a PBS documentary about becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nBefore that I'd seen three people who ever looked at like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch the last twenty minutes\nWhich talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all of these people will go\nOn the street and risk their identity their life they were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men who was being said that\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their job\nThey fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Filipino people are now saying\nCould happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American Asian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points\nDreamy support for WAMC comes from Albany mid no open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu that's your

eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish and her eyes that she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me the ...\nI think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask\nAbout a murder man and our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking up articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily

relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's at some\nMoments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because of this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was\nRallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family or someone who spoke up\nTo be a pot again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know so now I'm like I have to find out who\nWillie ... and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place
