Jenny middle of the University of California is a co will so it's a study\nAbout Ninety percent of protected areas with lions are underfunded it's a pretty dire situation we found that these parks

it\nNo in fact it may get to be a higher number\nAs lions continue to decline in the pressures on protected areas become worse but it's not all bad news because it's only one point two billion dollars I mean relatively [laughter]\nUs twice as much on the management of its national park system or you know that might be equivalent to a purchasing a U.S football team like the Detroit Lions so for a relatively small costs we really can't save lions and their ecosystems\nAnd secure the backbone of Africa's parts\nIn the report you make the link a but if there isn't a major increase in funding that will be a decline in the population of lions that were you focus your social norms why what's the link\nOh because lions are the top predator in the ecosystem\nAnd so their survival is linked to the entire food Web all the shows as well as the below them so they're basically a proxy for the overall health of the ecosystem and we know that strong resilient ecosystems benefit people directly

why we feel like the timing of this study is particularly useful because we are at that tipping point the actions we take now will determine the future of the lions and they're larger ecosystems\nBut we'll causes you to report now as opposed to five years ago well ten years ago\nWell I have decreased about forty percent in the last few decades and so we're really at that at that point where you know their populations have declined to the point where ecologically speaking they're just gonna keep heading south when species reaches a certain point in their population there's really just no turning back\nSo we feel like we're at the point now where there are still enough independent populations that are resilient enough and strong enough and there's enough protected areas which is what we focus on that have good populations of lion that if we invest now we're going to prevent falling off the cliff\nAnother argument you might read the report is framed as a case for investing development from doing in protecting parks now if I'm In charge of advocating looks for money for the vitamin on thinking for civil hell for roads and schools no better funding for talk so how'd you like our cars\nRight that is because a lot of people don't associate conservation with benefits to people and so they tend to invest in human focused development like infrastructure\nEducation but really investment in parks with wildlife is investment in people because of the benefits ecosystem on human health but also tourism so it's important to realize that the wildlife watching industry in
