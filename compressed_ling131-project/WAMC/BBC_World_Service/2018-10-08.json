the emerging former says Andy ... who you heard briefly earlier and who's currently putting together the latest of the American Meteorological Society and you'll extreme weather analyses\nSo the comparisons that are generally made are made between our current climate where we are now in a climate before humans began to exert an effect on the climate system\nSo what we tend to do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we stimulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above and the current climate relative to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from World exposed so often the finished and then with cycles are reviewing number crunching to follow the assessment for twenty Seventeen is only now taking shape\nAnd we won't know what they will make two in the Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the

confidence and those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spell ... those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will that will just be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nIn last week's program climate soldiers Michael Mann explains in several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events that as the hurricane season started his mobiles was suggesting we were heading for something of a coma\nLet me issue a mayor culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming up several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you\nReally warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with scale for wins the Atlantic clinics But Kevin read Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most precipitation overland after impact of the dorm with fifty prevent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great some marketing who'd over this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of it the vent to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOkay if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously warm Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modify forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as editor temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and I believe that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific package ... that are associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a change in the ... the we actually have a pattern change of the epilepsy that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in that set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy this year while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic a causing even greater alarm they may have been implicated in many events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some is recovering more poorly each winter Julian
