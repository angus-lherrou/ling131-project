find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group which is\nA response to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals um who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who\nUm is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women and it's not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact I'm only forty eight percent of white women actually believe Dr Blasey Ford there is a far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working sure it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same\nTime I know you've described the problem\nI I get I get the into sick now the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common cold and that can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out a tool to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be the ... the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments when your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pulled and groups\nOr many of us are I\nThe challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been effort to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a\nMultiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the difference is\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are\nEvery thing that we've been seeing in jest that many women\nAre particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not

he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect bronco bottom of actually walking rather killing off he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWell I think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with uh\nFailure to actually even have a rhetoric and\nIdentify some of the structures that continue to create inequalities\nUm I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial

tried to perform that\nAnd it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of\nUh the white working class was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania I'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's a good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections to what we're in an election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting

fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data and in particular data about you\nI mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last uh several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily panic about sold at someone else's harvesting that data and particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nOr they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the ... it was this architectural weakness\nWell you're seeing people like Tim burners Lee served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period you have got to own your data\nAnd if others want to get that data from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants that our government wants to\nWear a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential\nAs Tim burners Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have it\nSo the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens like your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out is is is now kind of gently being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from a insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to

for them and ... the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially if Twitter data and the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by boats\nYou know I did a quick search this morning and found one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally the son of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines yes\nYeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or division of comments on line is that\nThere is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and heart in ... by their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific ways\nIt's extraordinary that um you just take a

they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world kind of like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another

but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other or at least they think\nWell yeah I mean when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or pots or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat them do use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them\nThe way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and the normal people getting
