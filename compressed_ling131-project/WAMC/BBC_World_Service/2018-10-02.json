here for you this\nIs your body you know you can do it it's just different activism work we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just ask what was your breakfast I usually asked my patients they have you eaten you\nBecause she sometimes for gets herself she has ten kids and she had been even eat and you know the ... she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you've taken into consideration and it comes to like everything\nFor my last eleven years since I went back home my view it's completely change because I got my education from Russia and I spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came severely

bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or ... children I just to get my second husband if I don't give him a child he was just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen and shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader I started listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from it's not only being a physician who or training the west that time for my clinical skill and when\nI went to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you faced take all the sets off coupon about your work it focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for them because those treatments were designed for men and women went inside\nWell science it's really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only a clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use and research they are far more frequently male animals\nThere is a real sense that using female animal makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women\nSo much of our science has been done on a male model and even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women in late face clinical trials\nYou're still dealing with the issue of\nThe science on which the clinical trials with based being based on a male model\nAnd can you give us an example of the disease that affects the cheap sex is different she sure\nLet me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see and cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque\nOr the hardening of those arteries in the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference so if you don't understand why you'd see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked\nThere are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology women are more likely to develop all timers women are more likely to develop depression\nWhy is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something this actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg\nBut the good news is that we are learning these things but we still have a very long way to go\nNow Dick

civil war and until recently there was no central governing authority one of the greatest Barry is the fact of treatment for the woman in UK everything you can imagine\nThere's there because when you're done ... where you don't have lost to follow you know the\nBrutality happening to the woman its body and all the way they delayed the way they don't allow him in Tibet surgery because the men said so or because of there is a con deficient so if you're a woman and you're married from one client and you learn from other so you become an object of the\nRivalry between the two clients and they

you're working in the type of environment that day covers describing\nYou're really thinking about whether or not only the disorders that diseases that affect women\nBut also what is the context of that disease so for example if we were to start to think about lung disease\nIn certain areas for example in Africa and other places at one of the main causes of pulmonary disease pneumonia but also chronic pulmonary disease or cook stoves you'd see what the end result is but how do you begin to understand and unravel\nNot only what is the cause of it but how do you change practice practice is so connected to culture and to use those structures within a culture to change behaviors and that's something that doesn't happen overnight\nDeclare anything to add to that you're right it's just\nCultural change and also development change you know government to test to change it not only hospitals and medications you just took the but still housing sanitation plumbing old that includes

it creates friendships hunting slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow that can be amended\nSo I think it has a much wider road
