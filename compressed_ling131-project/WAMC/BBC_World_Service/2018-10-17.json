of the Irish border and the coverage breakfast status of northern\nIreland are obstacles that cannot be overcome\nI'm disappointed maybe I'm not surprised but I'm not without hope so just let me take this week because everyone quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um well what\nIs happening is that took the continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of northern artist and the island of Ireland is the issue is that the withdrawal agreement if you like it still has to be completed on because remember

example but I'm going to propose changes\nI guess what you won't agree with all of them but you take someone bought that have not happened\nIn these negotiations what is happening and that does the travelling part that I Hope we can get over is that the u._k. side on diet their right to do they have said well\nWe don't like to withdraw we went to northern we're proposing that in the future

than you tech like engineering box of stock top vertigo era uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in about voting that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York\nOr London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the\nHighlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the
