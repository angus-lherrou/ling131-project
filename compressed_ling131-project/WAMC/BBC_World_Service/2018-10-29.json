murdering and torturing political opponents during his Seventeen year rule\nThey argue that under international law European countries could try that general serious crimes conducted elsewhere at large for the British public opinion supported the idea\nBut says Patrick what's in the general himself now under house arrest in what was remained unfazed by the crisis unfolding around him\nThe first time I mention was in this house on the one with the state\nAnd that was a peculiar thing because he was sitting at this lunch table and we had the English special rounds police are controlling two of the rooms and meanwhile the rest of the house was controlled by the Chilean military and the leading figure among these was the cook who'd be bringing these biscuits out on the on the full of

between the ... movement of an angry Spanish judge and the CPS on the other hand you do need to be aware of what you're up against\nThe CPS or crown prosecution argued that General Pinochet had no immunity from prosecution General Pinochet argued that that's a former head of state he did the arguments went on for months\nYou have to understand that you're going to do my job properly you always have to be direct with your clients and told them what you think you need to say to them this is the only way that I can help you this is what you need to do\nThat at some moments when they just have a blind spot will they cannot move for reasons that are awfully understandable to them but not to me\nThat's frustrating and quite a lot of that happened in the ... case because there were very few

zero success in the from the legal perspective from day one we didn't win a single significant hearing\nIn fact the legal battle was moving against Pinochet in Nineteen Ninety nine the Lord's ruled that Pena shake could be extradited serious crimes allegedly committed often Nineteen eighty eight when Britain had ratified the un convention on torture it was a momentous decision\nOverturning the international tradition immunity for former heads of state but Patrick had already begun pushing a different idea an exception on the grounds of Pinochet's ill health\nHe was a frail man question about it he was quite large and have to be moved around with care I think what the media did was they took the impression that he was in some of because of the fact that we moved around in a
