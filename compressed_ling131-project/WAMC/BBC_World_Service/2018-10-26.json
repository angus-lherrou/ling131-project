because of insecurity and lack of government control of the park steal territory like Bruce Lee exposed ever thing that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban or al Davis precedents of attacks on polling stations the Afghan people defied all of that and came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the Afghan people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end the s F\nA I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do know

been paid yet what does that say about your government\nAs a national security adviser that is exactly what is on my Monday to change I I Do realize that we have a lot of challenges because I knew was one of the reasons I accepted into this job it hurt\nMe personally as an African to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint and I'm dedicated me and the national Security

I'm I ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war\nOur aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nTo help us along that way and know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste\nYeah that's where water is not an easy it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more now than just

kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe ... we don't have much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric friends for many of the head of Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contract to force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism a and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for

Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a

was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ... you didn't know he has to be very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't want to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... I had the special envoy was talking to the Taliban and it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided\nThat far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are uh in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do bone and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor a success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be a shame that old your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm already asked by a ... through a process went on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMissed the national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell well the Taliban contend elections\nThere more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other

it's a real threat\nI think that it is you know when people talk about a return to the trouble is I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think of all the hard border would introduce with brains all the way from street protests and maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups of death and the Republicans on what our most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton said\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are car and all that work would become a target\nThan if the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the play service here how serious concerns about ... a new a hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view if\nAll that people in all the non and too I Would actually like to see the ball to come
