prescription pill that pain pills we have a high level of of pain and our uh Appalachian region\nWhich has a many coal miners and other people who are involved in manual labor and and uh end up with

are given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge you talk\nTo you know how many girls will actually rages in number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh Johnson\nHow did the investigation and fooled\nWill basically this was an organization that has had some rumors around it and it was no one in Liberia that there'd been accusations of rape but but really no one ever gone deep and to\nReally find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is that the organization right after this happened there was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown\nThere was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that that the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in care\nOr so when the rapes came to light the organization essentially said and this was in their press statement that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mountain organization who died an intimate relationship with the wind or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him by giving him the power to the educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school and\nThen when it came to light that he had been ripping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating\nCultures in a challenging contacts may have contributed to his ability to access and abused young girl\nThey mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in how would you do and what our investigation reveals that way when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually affected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that the ten girls who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so\nWhat we know is it to students who are named dozens victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate just generally there'll be any changes a tool to make it hard to fool the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think the after this took place that's certainly true that the organization sought\nTo to strengthen its policies and sought to increase the hiring practices and implemented a whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between

aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the well on track to meet anything like that target festival\nTo clarify up the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the government has to ask do you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen independents agreement on people's cleared up two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this

than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city centers so I'm a and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality the laws they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design of well but there's ... lowering our missions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLaw where it is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing\nFrom from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten a some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term clause doesn't equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra see the price of things that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people said larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot\nSay that there are no losers what we can say that\nThese losers from the transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of government to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nUh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get the short\nTerm ... cases I can just bring you back from them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rides and the two degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in that sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLook to sort of question some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the transition with a massive increase in the months of renewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nGood to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effective use greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the\nOil financial products or pension for that has to be aligned with the one point five parrots target for example I can see that and I'm In the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on hold for they say look ahead and they mentioned the world that is climate change with climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now you\nIt just went to us to do that when I came to question who's going to pay for\nThis one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nDoes this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable broke and when asking the question was going to pay for it for just one solution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observant today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd ... to a degree of forming this is not in the far future does this um one point five of the current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for that\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they she the poor of the impacts of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and entering a real welfare law where he wants to come back\nAnd yeah I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a nine to nine countries we win evil feeding tired Seventy three countries with\nAuction fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of ... coming down significantly so these is making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance agreed no but ... is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient\nSolution icon economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize that there's been um scholars and political science working for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy

bring you back in I touched on the idea of you feel well you'll viewed as nuclear power not ready to clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy reporter for this year's shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five donors and make all the time and I'm sure when the twin does it make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrify our energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible in the most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new bills\nBut when somebody will and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually accept the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for a think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the line from tradition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make Monday's IPC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints to one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they'd been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nOh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda it's much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they got nothing that's on to say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea time back with us effectively to shift into this battle lost\nI think there is a fact of leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration had said they believe that science and it uses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA

signed up to\nSee how but how do you decide to date and of course that tree howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo innocence what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nAnd I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states the colon stunning spaces in long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other ... shots shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the points the facts of becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's a ... with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states has so many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by\nThe strongest hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because it's sea level rise is a good chance the warmer than average waters and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing costs to varying the impacts of climate change in the United states\nNor at one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S and gone with it has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to see her all at the route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know kind of an energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with it Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies\nAre are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the fact well the very

joined us today from Cairo joy to I Want to about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described with some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's up\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efforts\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNobles but at the thing that made me just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas\nIn the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection and I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in help\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with you\nAnd doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian government ... that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization presidents that if you like caused the problems of climate change\nAnd therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat in Nineteen Ninety to ... and then five at that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action fist\nNo it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass the mistakes of the north\nAnd you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the old tried to convince off ancient funds to stop investing in fossil fuels but the question is what the pension funds going to do with those talks with yours are they going to sell those wants all the rules or\nThe investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea to shifting the problem is that great and so I don't think developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels they should try to bite off that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think\nFor a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\nOf a democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to decisions relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd

educational ... he was founded by an American wedding cakes in minor who raised millions of dollars and it's even gone to a building or by the then President Johnson Sirleaf my Twinkie fourteen

charged you will still able to operate unreasonable funds despite the scandal on good people in Liberia now one month took up the story you know your long investigation on Tuesday was really\nYoung he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by pro public uh and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called West Point when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier who was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground ... girls often managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according to their statements to police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten\nWhen the ... began on ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff at the time as many as thirty according to an internal charging talking\nTo you know how many girls will actually raped as a number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh wants one of the interesting things about that is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role\nIn the crimes that that the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care or so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation they minimize the role of the men who had been a central mine and they were going to station had an intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him and then they said well this is a Liberian

young girl\nThey mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals that way when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped locked infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also has victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named dozens victims by indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual

girls aren't exempt from these kinds of invasive comments about their bodies um and you got them not just from the appearance but you also get them from adults\nEspecially from grown men and um it made me very uncomfortable on this thing would they say [noise] men would say things like um you know you ... ... which is like basically you're developing a bomb\nAnd then also women they would say things like cover this or your bum it's too much or you're developing breaths and like they'd actually be taught him like pincher bomb\nThey gave you the impression that your body was inserting itself into the public view and then it was your duty to hide it\nAnd then not just stop but then they transmit very official comments about people's weight as well so if you're ... your cold or a ball and if you're a sin like they call you won't go fish and like they make all sorts of like horrible comments about you [noise] um so that was really where like the eating disorder starts it\nAnd will that

through the same thing because there isn't very much record for people who you know had been molested and it's usually in scenarios with that they brought it on themselves\nI'm so because of thought people really learn to self censor in a way and one of the things that you can do is like you know to shrink yourself and to to make yourself less visible and one of the way of doing that to start

was\nEncouraging dangerous extremism and many other parts of the world where Saudi resources were being invested in mosques and ma dresses and what have you\nOn NBS addressed all of this and he said to Bloomberg just a few months ago he said look we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without a civil war in our country without stopping the country from growing on with continuous progress in all elements\nAnd you asked you said with regard to human rights if there was a small price to pay\nIn that area it's better than ... paying a very big event to make that move now\nSurely in Washington there is still residual sympathy with that sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been\nIn the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen Seventy so the Iranian Revolution the Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly but Israel now enjoys the best relationship\nPolitical foreign policy intelligence that they've ever had\nAnd so you've seen the

show he I think both political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which I think would be the right move interesting\nYou say that I was just looking this morning at the fingers in the last year the American arms exports to Saudi Arabia with some Eighteen billion\nDollars Saudi Arabia I think takes more arms and virtually any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... walls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether your belief\nThat the Congress for example is now going to cost really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia is really going to happen\nYou know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but I Do think two things may happen one is you might see I think you should see if this\nSorted drama continues if there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and that cannot be that's going to be a problem for mom and been solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia about his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening a Saudi influence around the world or a week and yet that's the first thing that could happen second there are many members of Congress who are disturbed\nBy the use of American weapons by the Saudi authorities in Yemen that have been directed a into civilian areas it's been a tremendous loss of life there have been cholera outbreaks it's a great humanitarian crisis\nAnd I don't know how long the Trump Administration is going to be able to justify\nThe transfer of weapons to Saudi Arabia for that war which has been so destabilizing on the Arabian Peninsula my Dolly\nIrish said we have talks at some length about the number of prisoners that MBBS his looks up for this and I think you put the figure in the thousands\nIncluded in that

and you can't support this war in Yemen with not continue for\nMore than ... because the Saudi Government continues to frame that war in the way the context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between Saudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians\nA framework which frankly games a lot of traction in Washington and otherwise why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nUnfortunately that Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it has intervened in Arab countries it hasn't been shown that ground it has supported as groups in Lebanon and Iraq and Syria and elsewhere\nBut the argument that we can tolerate it at a press in regime that has actually gone out of its way to kidnap prime minister like the prime minister of Lebanon and

without actually they us the main protector of the Saudi monarchy putting a certain conditions on it's on equivocal unconditional support it's unbelievable\nWe have to end in a moment Nicholas Burns I'm going to turn it back to you you've talked about the strategic importance of Saudi Arabia if we look at it on one level today we see a young Roula let's call them the ruler of the country NBS

the strategic balance in the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt instability in Saudi Arabia\nThe last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world will be instability in Saudi Arabia is taking I think we're looking at\nAlmost a Shakespearian drama here you can see the promise of reform and the acts of reform\nOr by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side you see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other Saudis\nAnd and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turn\nBut certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered um this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and for those of us those countries around the world would have close relations with the

basically inside thing about ...\nYes exactly which is one of the things you've got to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can get into trouble if there's a lot of
