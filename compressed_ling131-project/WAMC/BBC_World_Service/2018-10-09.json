both directions first of all Elvis worship Marlon Brando and James Dean\nAre actually in the movie could Creole plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando at commissary on the studio lot he shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando is kind

concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nClose your what's your view\nOf the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music and
