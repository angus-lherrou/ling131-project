she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt that every waking day the ... prime minister takes a lot of the incoming file for many angles uh mostly from those who are willing to very heartbreaks over breakfast or no deal a tool\nBut she doesn't touch and what she's doing as she is saying very clearly that uh the union of the United kingdom the full conscious of the u._k. must be held together and that the peace process behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United kingdom now she has stuck to that\nBut the problem we've all just to try and find a solution which square the circle between the principles of the ... and the principles of holding\nTogether at least ... it's quite if I may interrupt just because we are done by Irish foreign minister Simon coat and they said yesterday that will be no withdrawals agreement without the Irish ... ... and ... story so all of this\nShuffling of papers and

money and then in effect by the government's\nWhat's better or working or the candidate that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls in turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architect you wasn't there for people to just play ... and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only parts of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them in terms of boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawn fats artificial ... points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out to vote it's not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved

in Texas of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls\nCan you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in any traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sex and I think that better work is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas and that race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way of the most\nVotes in terms\nOf ensuring our forty minutes president here of our country Donald Trump [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over oil may end up being fairly even so how might this translates into success at the polls\nDoes the money even matter that much Donald Trump off rule under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one much academic research of recent years just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential on voters\nSo how should campaign be focusing should they be spending an online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his Wesleyan Media project tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lot of time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you were running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nSince TV advertising still work\nDoes work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent and have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from ... woods to warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nNumbers and the closer you get to election day the more likely that means you'll get more votes but what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns so that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage of the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to regret regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive\nDistricts in states and I should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next uh in the next ten days", "show_name":
