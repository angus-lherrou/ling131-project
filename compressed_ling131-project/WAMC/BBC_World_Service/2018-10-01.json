I'm\nJust remind us so why does the government wanted to demolish it\nThere's a few levels you have to understand here the the the reasoning that the government is giving is that it's a simple planning issue which you know sounds innocent enough but there's two other issues that place here and one is that we're talking about occupied territory\nAnd according to human rights groups of the Palestinian authority is and ah most world leaders forcibly displaced thing that protected population than occupied territory is anything from a war crime to a great breach of international law and on the geopolitical level it the location of the village is very very important\nUm it's it's in a place of the west bank where if\nThe Palestinian population is removed and Israeli settlements come in to replace them where there's already settlements or exist in there are many people say that it would it would cut the west bank into two different pieces\nI'm making a contiguous territory impossible should we ever see some sort of peace deal mhm and it would also cut off East Jerusalem which many people are\nThe Palestinians and much of the world believe to be a will be the capital of the ... of a Palestinian state and then cut it off from the rest of the west bank\nA piece of people have been living here since the Nineteen fifties now these really government said the structures we built on state owned land without panda turn the Israeli miniature he which undid the Nineteen Ninety three owns a call it's has exclusive control over construction in sixty percent of the west bank known as Area C suggests this fall within ... the\nIt does the residents claim that it's actually privately owned land owned by a a a nearby Palestinian town\nUh but the other thing you have to understand about Area C and and there's really control there is that the Israeli military which is responsible for approving a building permits and in that area that you mentioned denies\nWell over Ninety percent of Palestinian requests for building permits and the residents of kind of a smart one of their their last ditch attempts to stave off this this demolition was to submit a their own planning\nAnd their own master plan for for normalizing the the the the building permanence of of their village is something that Israeli government allows settlers Jewish Israeli settlers to do when when they're caught building a what the Israeli government that describes says go ahead\nMichael surely the Israeli government then has offered them an alternative place to go to despite a international objection to this has said being an alternative pace in where would that be then\nThere is it's a location not too far away um it's a girl so very close to a trash dumped a which is you can imagine\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery

far away um\nIt's also very close to a trash dumped a much as you can imagine it's not as not ideal for this for this residents and the other the other problem they have with it is that it's it would ah presumably stop them from\nA continuing their uh their lifestyle which involves are hurting and and other agrarian aspects\nOkay and it has become an international issue we said there's been a no international objection to this including the un advancing against it that Israel has not and nascent has gone to had to wait to I said what's likely to happen if they should go ahead\nYou know the Israeli government has been trying to to sort of take over this area and remove the Palestinian population for a few decades now and up until the Trump Administration the Americans and the rest of the world have essentially told the Israeli government do not do this ...\nAnd now there's there's very little resistance and if the European Parliament orange that it would be a grave rich rich with international law uh last year or\nMany European countries want Israel that there would be a reaction that this happened but it doesn't seem that there's any any real threat\nOkay Michael ... editor

La Nina setting and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be held comma\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty Eighteen so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of a system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods\nWildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs a gr off puffing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least nine among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages or any parts of the climate story and know the ... that matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate that science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yet we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting of ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes\nAnd so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting their unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines\nThat is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless hospital to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of rule does happen\nStreaming support for WAMC come from ... what's the warmth in

are impacting their unfolding in real time honored television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless hospital to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of rule does happen every yeah\nAll right let one entail what Iran is not necessarily harming our what we can say the reason why we do ... any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that they can still quite rare and is now ready to call in and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAt the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived herds of heat heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worst droughts you take\nExtreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is defective climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high stress is very jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks they also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America\nWhere the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia it's getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential\nFor worst wildfires and what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California only\nThis summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the the profound challenge the climate changes already posing\nTo us [noise]\nDivided ballet historic emergency the largest fire forty amounts bigger\n\nAre

California last winter to stimulate a surge of bras gross to add an abundance of drawing on the gross which fueled far storms\nIn some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent of normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking\nYou know this just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem and so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising hairs and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and um I I think we we're all feeling tension that we're not you just feeling around fire in California we've had it you know the last\nTen

to find the Mendocino hailed actually a pair of finds that started on July the twenty seventh ... only finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning near to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California\nIt was during the height of the summer so the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing through those areas it was just all the right conditions for fast buyers bread and extreme fire behavior and so the fires grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in a twenty four hour period or or more maybe\nThe the rate of growth made it very difficult for Cruz to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that the next biggest was last year in Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres
