I can ... I Believe that I live alone all into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nNow and there's the question is where the self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm blushing between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on how to not so long ago we spoke to a woman called ritual does though who\nIs white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and lived a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents if it came out of a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWhat being black is and she said look I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to think about because\nYou ask what's the relationship between self ... and and and others I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of the euro and rice all on the air and races a special category you need to if you if you don't like where it's put you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trans people have done what Rachel Dolezal didn't do\nWhich is they've created a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be an artist and they've opted to change the system I have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if they did a little bit of how do I am asking then the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nIf racial they'll they'll have could have provided a could have made these arguments on the side of the people in the the thing and if you could have done it in the weight of a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction they see well and I'm interest I'm willing to listen to her arguments and doing it that way\nIs if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other things have to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in

of that is is the the moments when identity is leads to to hostility and hatred and division that's the thing the ones that can fall\nFor that I think some things can be said a but these are the things that are known to social psychologist one is so close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identity tend to be less bigoted than people who does so don't allow yourself to be channeled off\nInto a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among 'em\nStraight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience to people of all the major kinds and do things with them about race or religion or or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about\nUm you know building something in your community together worked together with people because I think working together with people of diverse identities\nMakes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly if you have folks ideas about them as long as the falls out some leading you to behave badly I'm not so worried about the people have false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and it and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nThe final thought we have a a thinker and rice or in the United kingdom king David good heart who said that these days the most important distinction and identity that that one can use when looking at people in western society is between those he calls\nAnyway as an literacy cold some ways now the anyways other highly educated usually metropolitan highly immobile people who are comfortable\nIn an open intellectual environment living pretty much anywhere in their own country or indeed in the world that would be you and then there's some way as on

you've just been painting with me\nAm happy to live in the world with the somewhere as I just don't want them shaping the well for the rest of us in a way that makes us it's a very difficult for us to do what we want to do so if my my favorite example of this is the American example of the Amish in Pennsylvania\nThey throw themselves off they don't like talking to strangers and they don't like money they don't like the guy that had like lots of things that I think of us and them as sort of inevitable Boston London will and they've made a wealth of themselves I think they're entitled that I
