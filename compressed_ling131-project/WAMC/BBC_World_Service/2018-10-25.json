they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior account\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats photographic images et cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about the kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nHow would come by itself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's dumped a molten Bayh he's a research fellow at the center for deep still future at the University of Southern California but more importantly\nHe's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the un yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good and balance\nWhen ... the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices you cheat never before Star Wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... think prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people what\nStreaming support

what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nWere sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls I've been sort of themselves in American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nAt the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kinda have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer attack say that's the kind of idea just to generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that division haven't always existed in society to take the salt was example whatever people's thoughts would about the Compton choices than would always be some people who agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... our rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nAs Yoda says anger leads to hate and hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start\nUprisings but Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nFrom a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen ... video does its to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe confidence is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments to vie do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because of the ways so provocative\nIt solely bound to increase the divisions in societies that are well already divided\nIf you're a sympathetic to honest points uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that are rabid conservative righty is just spinning out of control on the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias\nThen divvied you will only consent is in the strongest possible terms you'll very likely to see it as an

each year so if you rely on the strict definition of a ... the U.S outspent China by at least five to want\nA quick reminder at this point the o da is official development assistance on a nominal terms the U.S economy is roughly fifty percent bigger than China's so for the U.S to be outspending China on OD a by five hundred percent suggests a big gap\nHowever if you broaden the definition of foreign aid to include all types of us and Chinese government financial flows China and the U.S look a lot more like overseas spending rivals over the Fifteen year period again to thousands of two thousand fourteen\nThe U.S government spends roughly three hundred and Ninety billion dollars around the globe and the Chinese government spent three hundred and fifty four billion dollars over that same period of time\nSo if you broaden the appetizer and use that broader definition of aid China spend about twenty three and a half billion dollars a year and the U.S spends about twenty six billion
