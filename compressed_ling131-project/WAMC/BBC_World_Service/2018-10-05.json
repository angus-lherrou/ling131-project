essentially\nThe idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or\nUnder the ... yeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government to nowhere shifting governments have spent quite all of a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and he has been focused on in Norway for Twenty years so I think also an to challenge the politicians have with a greater pen because I don't think when you were saying that solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm it's doing to climate change is if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to get time for it or not\nWe have a lot of discussions about women parks we have a lot of discussions about every single form of energy we're putting out there so it's not that easy to just to shift and there's also another concern that huge that season to unions because of\nIf you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way and that's the discussion above your work about where you live what you're going to do it's a problem\nThat I just want to come with an example again and we have this island big island outside of your calls from now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase the two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with the local uh energy company or or the regional and we're actually looking at together with the community it's on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in that situation that he's growing up with\nThat we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy future it's here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody

developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars as it is in ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nThere was an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we talked about but it's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields when the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of towards ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in the in the room so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students asked for it\nCan come in to vote no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the developments in the uh the American I'm a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift to the even though we we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the amount of time sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made up here I\nKnow but it's it it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and that turned ... now in the end the sector it's really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of over ... new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument is that you will see now that when you have energy we indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today\nStreaming support for WAMC

that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\nAnd does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the barn she comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy that\nYou can argue that no agent energy plane at some people might not have reasons to buying it but it will say that it means that the way the counterweight to lead pilots that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\n... and the parents have they have drilled about twice as much to Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the air and sea and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nYou ... that is according to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally the summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe I guess we'll exclude cold if because of what you mean by that call them price\nThe price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nOn the market inside Europe um the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push health renewable\nBut he still and to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid to be called the core of approaching no but also the way the energy system works and seems to nibble energy so much more cost efficient\nWhen it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep
