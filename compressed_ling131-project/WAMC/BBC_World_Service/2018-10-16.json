was sort of social media and the Internet today but cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only sought models of language and figures like Shakespeare gr attuned Schiller or many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um the image is as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm and its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly crowd solve language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think a writing properly in crowds his mind could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a combat due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for crosses all an indication that there was something deeply a ride in the morality of the author or more likely\nA one could say of the morality of that society in which such language could be received and produced so an critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate when I'm Talking about one of crosses more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls that speech Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floored pros juxtapose then against cross his so called translation of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that his language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden duplicitous the or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they\nHave yeah and he's a school don't fully delusions two classic works of Jim and Jim and Shakespeare as you said and he was a continued the bullying tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of a tree or principle you've heard a few these already and ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and late to publish them in book form several times\nBut he himself was all say aware of the limitations\nAn aphorism that coincides with the troops it is either a half truth old woman to ...\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows tell me Katrina why was that it's so important to him\nWhen I think at a had a really and David and relations\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate

instance um [noise] the direct max Reinhardt who was very famous at cross this time in Germany especially um he developed they own a mental showy um production\nAnd contrary to crowd he kind of embrace that yeah tricks of blender\nBut what crowds imagined or was it ... just the stage for the spoken word and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama\nUh itself and the thing is [noise]\nSo the picture on getting of crafts than is before the first World War is someone who is surrounded by lots of colleagues fellow officers\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably the other choice in pulling the others circumstance I mean this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and before ... and also because he was Jewish\nI think ah to kind of reiterate one of the most points he he despite the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious\nPolitical um I think that he saw dangers in complete media you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it's simply because crosses born into a small bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own or relationship maybe you'd better said to his own\nJewish identity um but just to give another example crosses thoroughly booth law but his sympathies in his early life lay with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class so in sometimes never with the class to which he\nI'm officially belong Americans that's just one example of seeing crosses outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements grounds one quarter profit men and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that his great love with Susan ... not hung up about ... and patron of the ... based in a small shop so about a hundred miles south of crossers birthplace in what is now the Czech Republic\nI'm the only country in the ... what was the relationship like\nI was first and foremost it had to be a secret relationship um they met in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war and ... as he called her she inspired class to write poetry\nAnd he also wrote 'em over a thousand letters to hurt you in the course of the relationship the relationship lasted with interruptions until his death\nAnd maybe it's especially noteworthy that cross you had his hands full with a his work you just mentioned the uh nine hundred and twenty two issues of the fact that he didn't he didn't mean that Danny's case uh he really sat down and wrote like every other day very level that a\nHerd lettuce to him my last um we don't have them\nBut we know from his letter that he shows have very different kind of personality and in them he's really in love the I think he would have wanted
