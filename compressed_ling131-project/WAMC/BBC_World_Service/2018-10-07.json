experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like

to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will that would just be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n\nWell\nLive [noise]\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles were suggesting we were heading for something of a coma\nLet me issue and mia ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these storms tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event as it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you\nReally warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and

forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a motive to petition overland after impact of the storm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great the likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount the strength of the event has been changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the normal ... Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer area than cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast initial education so that when we run these modify forecast with our climate change for a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as an affair temperature changes that have\nOn once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and believes that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that's ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for it so we're not just doing a uniform a change in the ... the we actually have a pattern change of the empty that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in the set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they said the interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic the sort of marginal waters that er\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOn of energy to see a waltz do far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThose sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turn into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic but potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "07"}
