clearly before is this is an impact structure that's buried it happened about three hundred and sixty million years ago when sharks were roaming the seas and plants just started to colonize lamp\nAnd so during that time this large event occurred it would have generated towering tsunamis and other catastrophes but over time it got buried and when we want to study it today we need other means to
