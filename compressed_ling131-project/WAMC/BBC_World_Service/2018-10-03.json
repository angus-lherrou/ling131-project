a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC requirements um the Federal Communications commission\nOr in the U.S that you had to participate if you are public broadcast or a private

point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think having that happen right the first one is that is legal they did set this up to say\nThere is a way to use this and it's only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically would be illegal now a lot of people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down the legal part won't stop someone who has already\nDone so much to a
