fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and he was a member of the president's commission\nAnother example of the problem is is there is a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that\nNon citizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check that's a problem and is the problem that in many states you don't have to show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place give them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are stirring up a specter for problem where there wasn't really a problem how do you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes\nIt would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and it's probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of votes\nThat have been taking the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of focus oppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you're talking by vision to unfortunate Patton voted suppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a bit patronizing I think frankly borders on races to believe that for example African Americans don't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose cures for problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision tons if you could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who were suing said was this is going to a depressed turn out the number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready them and is a senior reporter for Mother Jones

here are cases there there might be a county here or a county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there has\nBeen a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and had made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out so that you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problems and there are targeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution\nA lot more people have been prevented from voting and fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocked from the polls that have voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually fraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like ... so the bigger problem is\nThat a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to orange swayed from participating\nBecause of barriers that have been erected to the ballot box of what evidence do you have\nThat they actually do I think there's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws to reduce voter turnout and that they reduce voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas\nAnd Tennessee I think if you look at the intent\nOf Republicans have claimed on many different occasions that these laws have helped them politically that have helped him carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that fewer people that are going to participate\nBut also

of different reasons one of which is that people tend to approach the issue very sentimental they they tend to use language that is very romantic inexpensive but that doesn't really take into account

risk coming apart at the themes in class terms and many other terms besides and because of that with that in mind we ought to adopt a more integration friendly\nMigration policy one thought is that uh you're not necessarily going to radically increase the number of a new migrants what'd you will do is perhaps move towards selecting them on the basis of skills selecting them on the basis of a who will be in a position to help finance that safety net\nFor the various migrants we've absorbed over the last thirty or forty years because that to my mind is a really big challenge it's the second generation challenge how do we ensure that the second generation the children of working class immigrants are properly integrated into our society and are allowed to flourish\nIt kind of changes the whole nature of what America is about though is well doesn't it I mean Americans always being about people coming to see the American dream the noise the in the country what people just go to realize what they call it ...\nWell ... I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time when the birth rate in the states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today\nAnd that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states in that era\nIf you look at later you're us this would steal a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThan the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification\nThat entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks\nWho come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ...

[noise]\nIt's a question I put to at least a chunky she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of integration how immigrants have been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was our racial citizenship and in there\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perk for health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including may go robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nIn fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor\nBut they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and it's connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens and people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a dream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility\nThat this is something that when we look over the Nineteen twenties centuries have applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen to the early twentieth century of large European integration where there's the pose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who are coming into the country today it's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority\nOf immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor low educational levels and they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there's not upward mobility for them\nEver being a theory in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for European no there haven't even more recent on\nThat doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it statistically those populations has
