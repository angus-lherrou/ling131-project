[noise] all that long [noise] wrong [noise] for some evidence [noise] long\nGone [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is now in charge and today the we ever have a special treat for you for joining us in the studio is the claim movie director Arthur Penn\nMost of you will know Arthur Penn through his legacy of films like Alice this restaurant little big band night moves and the pivotal master work Bonnie and Clyde well at least films alone amount to an amazing career\nThey represent only a fraction of Arthur pins life and work through the years we'll be talking with Arthur Penn about all of this and hopeful\n... career they represent a only a fraction of Arthur pins life and work through the years we'll be talking with Arthur Penn about all of this and hopefully revealing some things about him that you don't know but first let me thank you for coming all the way over here from the bridges Arthur and for being with us Arthur Penn\nIt's a great pleasure to be here I listen to your show very often and it's it's always wonder if we done Arthur let's start at the beginning when were you born and I was born in Philadelphia my parents divorced early on in my childhood\nI went to live with my mother and brother where\nIn uh New Jersey briefly and then into New York city and the New York\nIn the Bronx and in Brooklyn and\nWe kept moving on because puns were non existent in those days it was a defections are deep in the depression and uh and how did your mother make a living she did a sort of janitorial job at a hospital called the good Samaritan and then gradually worked her way up to being the assistant to the director of a civil war\nSo there were brains in the family where she was a extraordinarily gifted person did you keep in touch with your dad at all or was that no they were there it was quite a bitter divorce [noise]\nI Would occasionally see perhaps three or four times during my early childhood and then at fourteen\nShe decided quite wisely I think for me to go and live with him with my brother who had already been there my my older brother and what did he do he's urging pen a great photographer of course I had no idea\nAnd what kind of an impression did that make on you if you can go back in time in terms of your future as a director in other words detail laying out scenes and posing people nothing\nAbsolutely nothing [laughter] survivor who was the essence of it and that was not a bad childhood you know it was on the streets of New York\nYou live by which you know but you got to high school when I was sent back to live with my father at fourteen I went to high school in Philadelphia a highly high then came out of all and not that sure they'd been within a year ago I was in the army and the war and what'd you do that serves Europe most like\nWell I was an infantry man\nI didn't see flat out Syria's infant reaction I did all the training\nAnd was separated at the last minute and I have no reason to know why it happened\nThat I was taken out of this basic infantry company\nAnd brought to something which was called the fifteenth army headquarters which didn't exist there was a group of people group of soldiers officers and we were stationed in the our Denver's really in a kings hunting lodge\nAnd bang that's when the ... of the bulge came surrounded us what do you remember that all I remember quite a lot of it because we're literally scared to death or I was one of the few men in this group\nBecause they were army specialist of a fairly high order having come most of them I think from the national guard it was a non existent army I think it was a paper phenomenon I've never really read anything about this but you don't know what they were doing there\nWell I I only know that when we escaped this hunting lodge I was sent back with three other guys to get both a Spanish couple who were the housekeepers\nAnd take the remaining files that had been left behind in ... and bring them to Brussels and ... years later\nPeggy and I arrived in Brussels to be celebrated for the first time by the Belgian film critics and we walked into this\nThey're paying I arrived in Brussels to be celebrated for the first time by the Belgian film critics and we walked into this hotel where I had brought these people\nWhat do you feel it can you remember your emotion isn't that what she describes it as having seen me just go white and dropped into a chair and it was true I I I\nI suddenly had a flash of what it was like that day when we came in a weapons loaded everything ready to go\nAnd it was really the G to intelligence headquarters to give up the fight I mean literally get enough I might did not and then you are in the middle of that I was in the middle of it I had set up a machine guns to protect us but the great good fortune that we experience was that the Germans were\nOn a dash to anti war that was a real game plan which was they would recapture and be able to use that as a porn and and showing back again through Belgium and then the French and ... get behind the allied forces [noise]\nFortunately it was a terrible periods of weather\nAnd on Christmas morning the sky cleared and from all over Europe they were caught trails of bombers coming in and the ground shook as they blew all the fuel tanks and the whole or you're lucky they didn't get you well we were well enough away yet by that point\nBut the sky black and from from this and the German attack ground to a whole\nYou know are there to ... but it occurs to me that somewhere you know this whole sort of mystical experience of being assigned to a unit there really wasn't and all the rest of it might have been a great film summer [laughter]\nMaybe I should really go through some military histories and try to find references to the fifteenth army headquarters that if that is because there was no army yeah you know it's so whether it was designed as some kind of ploy to deceive the Germans or what I don't know\nYou could find later in life that you still harbor some prejudice towards the Germans\nAs a result of that experience what I did certainly should after the war I was very difficult for me I couldn't go to Germany I went with my family and my very young son at that point\nEventually to Austria to ski but it was still\nVery difficult for some people think they were worse I Know when when when we would be where we're on the train and and in Cambridge customs officials\nWearing a uniform far too familiar\nWho was pretty upsetting experience because I ended up the war in Germany but what happened was there was a very there was very bitter fighting during the month of January my old unit which was a hundred and sixty Infantry Division lost two thirds of the people\nHuge huge loss\nAnd that was that was the bitter band of brothers foxhole to Fox or fighting that took place until the air superiority of the allies was so firmly established that they were able to finally cut off the supply lines to the soldiers\nAnd they create the the great numbers of surrendering I remember them just you know walking terribly and at that moment I have to confess I had a terrible sympathy for them because you live here I mean yeah\nIt was very difficult period very difficult so my attention was clearly not on academics but I got two black mountain and had a wonderful series of experiences\nWith people\nOf course one has to call them teachers but teachers as well as companions we live together we ate together we talked there were no classes as such you were in some credit dialogue with the people that you were they issued degrees no no they weren't accredited\nSo they didn't even pretend to know you got no grades you got no degrees you got nothing you were simply there and if you could live and stand the amount of freedom which was not always true\nBut it was pretty a difficult for so long ago I got what did you say I stay too full years the last part of that was John Cage decided to do a play of Eric sat tease\nThe route ... and Merce was going to do the staging and they decided to have ... played read well Bucky was paralyzed by that\nJust terrified so they asked me based on very little bit of theatrical knowledge I had to work with him so we started and the only thing I could figure out to do is to make as big a fool of myself as I possibly could happen\nTo work with him so we started and the only thing I could figure out to do is to make as big a fool of myself as I possibly could have been joined me so\nWe get down on the floor and start rolling around and laughing and jumping and pretty soon as this armor began to fall away from her many played it perfectly splendid why did they want him to be the lead well he was perfect for me it was a very small population\nAt any given time there were probably no more than a hundred and fifty people\nFaculty and students but the beauty of this experience was now he's the author penned a director for the for for the first time\nAnd then I thought well but that that's not really what I Want to do I I think I Want to be a writer I think I Want to be\nI was reading TS Eliot and thinking about Italy and Dante and I thought I've got two more years on that you had bill why not go to Italy so I did and they just had no problems with just putting out the money right could go anywhere in the world than it was Seventy five dollars a month\nPlus a small ... and tuition\nAnd you didn't need accreditation or anything like that nothing\nNothing there was a magnificent response to the war\nAnd so I went I went to federal Jeff first and learn the language and then I went to Florence for a year and a\nRed sort of Italian Renaissance poetry to the best of my ability which was not very good\nYou know you have to have grown in that language is like reading Beowulf but nonetheless it was a very pleasurable experience more than anything I discovered that I was more visually attracted to things and I was through the literature\nSo when I started traveling to museums to sites to following paying these paintings and\nAnd you know cracking down on hold is a massage show which belongs in the Florence museum but it's been moved to Naples [noise] so I get on a train or hitchhiked town to Naples\nSo that was the ... you know one of those this for years\nAnd then men I came back and I now I needed a job and I wouldn't know over a kid\nI thought I've got to be a stage manager on Broadway like that era\nOf course that didn't happen but I did run into somebody who said NBC is hiring for managers\nAnd a former manager is a sort of equivalent to a small time stage manager except it's very simplistic your stand off camera and you point to the person to go on the air and go off the air and speed it up if they're going to slowly or et cetera [noise]\nFortunately I had this credential from the army as having been head of this program so when I showed that NBC I got hired like that my first job was holding cue cards from Milton burl a\n[laughter] which went on for several days not all that pleasant because whenever anything we'd go wrong he would say it's a good guys ...\nOh God but it was it was fascinating and then very quickly this is really the early days of televisions fifty one fifty in fifty one television is just beginning on certain shows to be profitable\nMany shows were not profitable yet and there weren't that many sets it they were and black and white et cetera\nAnd then they completed the collection of cable across the country and a show that I had been assigned do as a former manager was the Colgate comedy hour which was in New York was Martin in Lewis and you know any candor and all those people and they all\nDo as a former manager was the Colgate comedy hour which was in New York\nWas Martin in Lewis and you know any candor and all those people and they all wanted to be in California desperately so a lot when Norman Lear and ed Simmons who were the writers for Martin and it was so we all were transferred out there\nAnd ... and I were sent out to sort of be the stage manager for managers of the show and train for managers for bigger shows than they had been doing locally in LA\nWell naturally if you had any sense in those days you could move very fast and very quickly we both became what's called associate directors at sea equivalent of an assistant director in movies\nWhich meant and moving in the control room and then very quickly after that the opportunity was offered to me by Jerry Lewis and I had a cat or\nTo be the director of the show like season how did that happen extending opportunities just doesn't happen that they must have known you they must have had some sense of oh sure they knew because I was with them or through each week's reversal well what was it like\nThere was a mad house it was perfect madhouse\nEach comic who would have been a week's worth so at the hotel Roosevelt would first of all be very impatient with their writers because they had to come up with comedy skits and then they would rehearse them then that was not the right thing to do then Jerry would say that in Norman Lear and ed Simmons\nYou show me you've gotta get up and do it you know and you yet so they would have to get up and I remember in Norman\nAnd Jerry would say no no no no no not yet let me and he would dive into the middle of it showing Norman Lear how to do with Norman Lear we had written for him who knew what the next quiz it kind of bad behavior it ... it was\nIt was wild in many respects Jerry particularly was ah\nThey were receiving sums of money that they had not ever dreamed of and a freedom because NBC was living practically on this show that CBS was living on the Ed Sullivan Martin Lewis Jerry was the real brains that yes or no well he was the real brains of it in one respect\nThat at that time the quality of their act was as a tour Muller you know\nThere were no limits he would break the line of cameras go out in the audience will all those things were sort of frowned on on on the other shows because television was trying to develop an orthodoxy of of the suspension of disbelief so you didn't violate the medium for amateurs\nBut actually for my taste the real brains was dean ... he was the funniest man first of all on his feet than I ever heard\nWith the we saw that much later we so that later after much much that he was pretty badly hurt by that period of juries dominance and then they broke\nUp and it was a Jerry was in ascendancy and dean was would've left behind as is\nRecruiter which was certainly not a description of and he was in an extraordinary man in any event prior to ... ever getting to direct these shows\nI got a call from New York from Fred Cole who is the producer of the silk go play house which was the dominant\nDrama show because I had four managed briefly with one of the directors Vincent Donahue they were doing a new show called first person that Fred had designed which was an attempt to do the first person shooter\nA new show called first person that Fred had designed\nWhich was an attempt to do the first person short stories of all the great runners Faulkner and Hemingway et cetera and so they were going to have this new program and they asked vents and to recommend somebody and he kindly recommended me\nSo Fred cold man said would you like to come to New York\nAnd try to be the director I'm going to have two of you be the director of this show and I said I'll be there tomorrow and that was the end of my comedy days until much later on Broadway and so I came to New York\nAnd there I first show first show I was the director who is at each other ... script\nJoe Anthony Mildred done like an Kim Hunter unbelievable unbelievable\nI simply said that job I said Joe you you're a director I'm not I I Can't talk to Milly dynamic and you know those people so I called the cameras and new directors\nSo that's how it started really and it was not that I didn't know more than I Am legend I did but I didn't dare express it yet because I had not found the language of the actors particularly the New York in group and this is Joe\n\n\nAnd he went back to California and came in response saying ten thousand dollars on the way to bill\nAnd we did the miracle worker on television live before Broadway and before the film\nWith Theresa right playing the lead with Patti McCormick\nI can come here of but it was a lie and from where we had been you know using only three cameras in the east here we were in this new studio with magnificent equipment using five and six cameras and it was a gigantic event and\nMiracle worker was known success as a live television\nShows no can scope of that either yet there is a few minutes but then there was this huge response from people around\nAt that point I'd ended my other three shows and\nI went off and went to Warner Brothers to do my first movie with Fred from a script by Gore Vidal\nWith Paul Newman [noise]\nDo you belong to the mall\n[noise] are you on them all those men what's your name say hey my\nName's William ... says he wants to work [noise]\nHe's one of the city show is against is about to get on the main gear canteen of selling it for about a scene that he gets a little ... will make camp here a Johnny, Johnny that here is that\nWhat you thought you were on fame binding vote again I'm Thomas alive O M ... valley for sure\nThe script was leader rewritten essentially by Liz ... Stevens me\nBut we had ... and we made a film called west tend to gun which was a\nA western it did nothing in the United states who was dismissed by all the critics is be to Artie and not western enough but there were critics are like that for there there were critics in Europe yeah on Dr ... wrote about the poetry of this etcetera but\nBut that was all year and a half later and when I finished shooting at film a guy came up to me and said hello I'm from a blind date I'm the best editor in Hollywood I'm going to edit your movie and I I just want\nBecause it seemed to me impossible I was editing shows there's one in the air how could you come in and and what I shot\nWith that was Warner's wife and then next thing I knew my parking space crews go on and I was off wonders what so I came back to New York city this is not the medium for me I have no interest in it bill\nIn the meantime with that money finished too for the CSA and read it to us to begin me and I just was knocked out I just thought it was wonderful and so low and behold he attempted his age and attempted to sell it to Broadway producers\nNo response no response nobody liked it I said I Know the guy the producers I took it to Fred co Fred took it over the weekend to Bucks County came back and said we're doing it and that was it\nYou give them ten thousand dollars for the first TV show when he gave them for that he didn't you didn't have to buy it\nSaid we're doing it and that was it if he gave me ten thousand dollars for the first TV show where they give them for that he didn't you didn't have to buy it what it did was he took an option on it and he raised the money and what he did was he set a script to Henry Fonda who was in the south of France and found that was the biggest star on Broadway\nAnd back came a telegram from fond of saying I'm yours\nWell with that he could raise that anything you what you know there was no limit\nAnd that was our our big task now was the task to find a girl a girl to play the part we tried every which way\nNot with a great deal of success but I had worked with this girl on one of the playoffs nineties and then somebody told us about her again the base hard I think Richard Bass said this this girl and Bancroft you oughta see her and she came in and bang\nThat was it she's not really been on the stage in our life she trained a little bit of the American Academy of dramatic art so there she was a first timer with Henry Fonda [noise] you know who was I don't know Hank Aaron ... Broadway\nWe let me get this straight this was on Broadway Broadway\nOn way so we're out of town with that show to people and bill said to me you know I think I'm going to write the miracle worker as a place for Hannah and I said oh bill you're out of your mind let's get this one on we were working day and night my\nFirst child was being born you know it was just a terrible pressured period so he can he really hit the lifelong partner whom friends we open to for the seesaw my son was born\nWe open to for the seesaw and it's a big hit and am bankrupt does this star overnight and then a short period later I get the script from bill and it's a script of America or this guy really knows how to work bill getting nose at work is a superb drama this\nHe has an skill dramatic material that I think is really virtually unparalleled American writing\nThere we were we were sitting on top of the world well at this point [noise] may I just boast for a while what happened was I did see saw I did the miracle worker\nI did ... homes toys and the addict ten rows of all the way home\nAnd an evening with Mike now was all I Am right now row bang bang bang bang bang and all on Broadway and on Broadway and four of them at one time or four or five of them running some of that is [noise] it was a really hard\nTo tell me a little bit about what it's like to direct I think those of us who are sitting out there have no idea really what a directed does when he gets there you say do this do that what exactly do you do\nWhat you do is you realize about a hundred and ten pages\nOf words that are put down as to be spoken and that's the text but as heroin Kerman would say that said text it's not a play until the actors do it and in point of fact it is that marriage of getting the actors to not just\nSpeak these words but really live the circumstances under which these words emerge so that you encapsulate the text with human behavior human circumstances and in vitamin D\nThat permits us when we sit in the theater then too deeply believe that we're having to it\nIn other words you say stand this way you look this way you know what do you do it's more mixed\nTheater then too deeply believe that we're having to it\nI mean in other words you say stand this way look this way you know what do you do\nIt's more mystical than that in his in a sense it's giving confidence to an actor to treat these words and not in the very conventional way that they might be spoken but\nTo personalize out of his or her life something that was equivalent to this kind of emotional experience and lo and behold\nWhat happens then is that the material begins to live in a way that is the conjunction of the actor and the text\nAnd it's a difficult process because until it happens it's painful\nAnd filled with gloom a million home and when we were doing to Asian addict I Jason robots Maureen Stapleton Irene Worth\nAn review or you know a wonderful cast but really in never understood theater process and she sat at those first rehearsals and every time one of those lines would come out she got\nThis painful cough and finally I said lily and go home and then come back in four or five days\nAnd if you don't like what we're doing fires or and start all over again if you have that right yes rewrite belongs to the playwright in theater\nOr have they have the absolute right with the most important person and all of it it's still a director if you know you know the most important person as the drama really the director is very important particularly if they have a comprehension and the trust of the play right\nThat ... what will happen is that out of this mixture of panic written actors and dry text a life is going to emerge\nYou know but that takes a lot of faith on the part of the play right\nSo is that true that the playwright is that's important I think the answer to this is going to be no in film as it is on Broadway\nNot at all you know just the rivers in film it is the director is always the director because film is so non dependent on the spoken word one can generalize that\nThat yes the content of the dialogue is very important yes the description of the actions are important but how their realized is really what makes a difference and that realization of the material is the director\nThere are a lot of people in film writers who tell stories about how they walk away they don't want their their name on it or they don't want\nYou know like I said yes but I I've always enjoyed a very good relationship with with all the writers except Garvey now but then you know I've been invited them always to be president to be part of it but by the time they've written it and then it's gone into production and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "WAMC Conversation with...", "city": "Albany", "day": "18"}
