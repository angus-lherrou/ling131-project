the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by new colleagues well I think they'll\nAll suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up\nAnd they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're prince and on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin out of places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the court swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new world look like I'm closely\nContested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights
