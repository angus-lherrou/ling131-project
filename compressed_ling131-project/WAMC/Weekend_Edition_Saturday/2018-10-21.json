with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us going to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most at threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vests outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside the of conducive city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul\nAbroad his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent other people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance and announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around and the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province are but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of

their intelligence services leaking information\nIt's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated in terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they looked like the hero in the story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as

what is in it for turkey uh what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated jet\nOr they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange the native investment that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so that doesn't want to

talk\nAbout Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to hold sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing

satellite is not true it's a lie so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not nice about why the west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the ... not just is even more\nI had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean so yeah it was before that so the federal police and the army were chasing the students how

injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students who are on the bus has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is quite that sounded good was just too\nI'm not so these two versus what exactly that two votes is that the army and they said that police start to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before it I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing

seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that developed to President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislators\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nSo they're just going to maybe votes on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats that any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that were really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those rates as\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad potholes\nAnd if this generation will reverse would Republicans hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just haven't spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping that score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that soon as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave\nThat's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the line now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the

black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other so that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and in many political context I'm\nThe most important thing in that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them that they should uh be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best view on on the ground so you have to balance it out\n[noise] the roles and identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talked about it without either alienating or collapsing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should onto your question directly gingerly castle I I think you you can easily go wrong hair I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing\nIs mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds\nAnd um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the twenty century they're drawing people together a through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a a real concern that identity and and the politics around it it has been weaponized and and it certainly\nYeah I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that where more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that you face will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah now the question is whether you can do that without you cold rightly recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity issue\nStreaming support for WAMC

calculated in terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a the beacon

that\nUh they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange the native investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on
