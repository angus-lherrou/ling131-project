about you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was

has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops than people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse that would actually occurring to me it it it

sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now but that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we go to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what life when we're dealing

would be even a harsher and those meetings just I think started to give progressive Lee worst\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to get progressive worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June to read from your mother the ... the she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that it's just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of\nParticular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think let me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em [noise]\nAnd individually started to start as a way of attempting to hide them in a disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police about your kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear enough thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see

literally wrote from overused ... wrote from not sleeping broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of Philly was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in the book\nBecause you were implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why\nStreaming

campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just one letter off on your application maybe is missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker and put the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about a noxious conventional ... vote fraud is we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is the complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law in his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the re chestnut\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both candidates motivating the bases really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so not all about who's going to actually show up\nJohnny Kauffman of member station WAMC thanks so much thank you [noise]\nBut David Sheff realized his teenage son
