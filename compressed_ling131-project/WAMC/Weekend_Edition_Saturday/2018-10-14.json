seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum when sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple estates\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history safety Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administration in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising and notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland is Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could

Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and that's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of got in the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple state\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they're sort of a handful surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by Pfizer for education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican towards him polarizing nominees for instance Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nAdmit that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but what's surprising and notes\nStreaming support for WAMC come from ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses

immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victory convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants in their jails that the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that cat from

be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get it got down here in a county we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five tense hours
