we're waiting for the Senate to vote but Brett Kavanaugh looks to be headed to the U.S Supreme Court\nJudging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have

generations could\nOh yes we assume the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents do named Bush and now to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been a growing force on the court for years and a swelling presence on the

we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian blushing forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it doesn't look to possible that they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople they're basically issues of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took but she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee\n'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's ... Christian bushy Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated altered have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks it's not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\n[noise] um but also you know as Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the cardinals thanks so much thank you [noise] ...

don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump\nUsed a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth for about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to

so\n... when when Donald Trump has said over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is set on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you that you can recognize and that may be people going over the
