interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane or the anthem\nWell at first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this\nIssue with players kneeling during the national anthem which started in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive\nAs it gets but it's not just people that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well\nWhat we found was these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the

calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation\n... short if it wasn't director of the TV and a certain result just to to stir things up apparently yeah\nAnd the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraud contentious issue\nAnd also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they showed some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to attract the debate\nI gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with these it sometimes seems to be a game whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up\nAnd one of the interesting notes that the closing professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations and they're continuing to weigh in on controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw\nThe new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue

by in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael friends who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ad these days that's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negative but a a number of them are also what we call contrast dads which pit\nThe policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those together you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found that the percentage of ads on TV that are negative is roughly this consistent with previous elections like the previous midtown\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no choke ... dog harness invented to make it easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nThousands of reviews at my dog Curtis dot com\nNegativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ads on line\n[noise] yes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tend to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter so just the season on through [laughter]\nUh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as a centrally being connected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack\nIs not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and in question should be raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric in public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone shipped by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nWell yeah this is a tough one to decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between both sides is at an all time high\nPolitical advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nAnd the only thing I'll say that it's a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television have to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle but you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic in those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael friends are voting college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow
