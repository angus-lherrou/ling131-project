[noise]\n[noise]\nBarry Lynn started out as journalists I worked in Venezuela and in Peru as a foreign correspondent and then after that I rent a magazine called global business magazine we shouldn't say it was a pro business magazine we were a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses\nSo we had a real inside look at\nA ... actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got the work going and we did it ah with increasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty sixteen we had a number of folks on the hill trying to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and are the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem\nToday in America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problem since a series of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms that lots of companies depend on for survival but Google apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with a small company so that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is it's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power\nThat leaves two concentrations of well at concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market Institute but also it's apparent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies and risks of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton

Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America were not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing\nSome of our attention on the\nPlatform monopolies and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the question is if it was um\nWas our work a new American problematic for Google Google or Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the board at Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years he stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also a CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself\nBetween Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this is the relationship that goes back to the very early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination\nEuropean antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted statement on the New America website it congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we released this statement in support of the decision and Europe and\nThat was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty knife I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times\nHeadline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision to be reconsidered on and if it could not be reconsidered I asked for more time I was told that neither of those was possible\nThe writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn open markets Institute told the simpler version of events he made it clear that lens statement about the European regulators decision\nThis was something that was a bit too far for Google and numerical was very generous in supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly are outraged by the treatment of very and I can't resigned from New America because I'm not affiliated with I'm not taking it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com

Florida\nAnders Ericson pioneer of the deliberate practice movement and the ten thousand hours idea have been studying expert performers for years\nBallet dancers gymnast an all sorts of athletes we've looked at chess experts surgeons doctors teachers musicians taxi drivers recreational activities like golf and even there is some research on on science is\nDefined choking for me as you see it\nOr choking to me is is actually somebody who cramps up an an and in some ways becomes unable to really act appropriately in the situation or or acts and a very decreased performance\nI've defined choking as worst performance then you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation and that's the on by luck I'm a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\n[noise] so I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people engaging regularly and we're we're most likely to choke\nI really think that any situation where there's expectations for success can cost choking and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching rate or if you're in an elevator and\nYou're trying to figure out what they're going to say something to the person next [laughter] you know we talk about these ethics moments of choking but it's a desire to perform at our best and situations in which

the best interview of the week ... is an economist at the University of California San Diego that would have made me very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this\nWhen we look at the incentives in comics we think about [noise] two ways in which it's going to affect us the first is that you pay you more you put more effort\nInto ... and the second assumption is that more effort will lead to better performance and that's not necessarily true and that's the part of choking might be that\nI can push you so much to to try so hard to really actually backfires really perform worse\nBeen easy coauthored one of the foundational economics papers I'm choking it's called large steaks and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including

completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead ... creative one was for example to pack pieces of metal into into books in an efficient way\nSome tasks we're cognitive\nAnd memory game in which I Would read up numbers you listen to me and then at some point do say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic throwing a dark like bowls so bold a on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars\nAnd ten daughter was about what they made during the month over there I open to to agree with me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make you work much harder riots and the question was are you going to be better actually when you were Carter\nAs can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics at higher pay leads to more effort and more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nSo the findings were striking and you'd see reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in your success rate when the incentives were really high\nFor the three digit memory game roughly forty percent of the participants succeeded under low incentives under high incentives the success rate which is twenty percent\nTo the dark ballgame the success rate under low incentives was ten percent and runs seven percent under high incentives for the middle of packing game under low incentives twenty five percent of the participants succeeded\nUnder high incentive nobody's exceeded or put another way at least twenty five percent of them choked\nActually were a bit surprised by this experiment because we included tasks in which we expected that effort will it will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure so can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks make us succumb to pressure\nThey ran some more experiments at MIT using students as a research subject some experiments involved simple manual tasks like punching alternating keyboard keys as fast as possible\nIt's really something that you know if you do it for long enough it's boring so if you will pay you more you'll try may be harder and we believed it more effort will actually increase your performance\nOther tasks we're more cognitive like adding numbers and major cities\nWhen you think about ... probably reach your ultimately behavior to your best and very fast and now he's saying really really making it high incentives you might actually started being you know distracted\nOnce again there were low and high incentive versions of each task since a dollar doesn't go far in Massachusetts as it doesn't India the rewards here we're up to thirty dollars for the low incentive\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the

percent succeeding on the other end when you have to end up numbers ... the one we see a sharp decrease from sixty five percent to forty percent\nSo when you actually have to put some clothes diverse listening to this getting the incentive to be ridiculously high could actually be a better idea\n[noise]\nThis would seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves some thinking\nWe're more susceptible to choke core you probably heard from a lot of people over the years coaches teachers and counselors of all sorts you are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out of the way [noise]\nBut that's obviously harder than it sounds so how can you do that how can you prepare yourself to not crumble under the very circumstances\nThat matter most how do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic\nSee on ... again going back to her Gulf experiments so we investigated whether going quicker for example um might help eliminate poor performance under pressure or I'm having one key swing thought that encapsulates your entire stroke\nMight be better um and we showed that some of that was successful and it leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess of your body up on on the back now you can say that with a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great said so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else can you tell us about in this domain at least I'm learning to joke\nWith we also showed that getting used to this type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes with performance can be helpful so\nReally inoculate yourself against the high pressure situations you see this with students who practice taking time pass a\nUC Davis with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions are going to perform under and you even see less if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players used to what it's going to feel like to be in that big stadium um\nAnd this is true in\nReally big important situations but it's it's also true in those little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it while people are watching you um and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to the kinds of all eyes on you\nOkay so put yourself in realistic and stressful practice
