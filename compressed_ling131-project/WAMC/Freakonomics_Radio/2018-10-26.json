accident that it's taken by the United states has repercussions\nAre everywhere are across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time has to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from the skies in an ambient that was a a knock ride and then found a direction that didn't that that was not there he is the results of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and uh if you don't understand the forces that

in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO is opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that tariffs are a really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where tariffs exists under a different name one of the U.S is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version then their their government subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries

time industries like protection they want to be supported by the government they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call behind the border protection\nA and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because

factors Brazilian engineering and being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO\nBrazilian um well the good thing about being a a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse perspective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspects of a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important ah aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective\nEngineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was

an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging and especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams

you're forever learning how to re ... relate to people how to take into account that diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case released another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike

factories clothes or in particular sector and the ... you cannot ignore that\nI think what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic tension\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things fester we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for governments in for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they arm or they have a role of course Madame minor\nInduce structural a change and I think if we don't realize that and if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what's the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nAnd from the

hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFree from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so what I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic might say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active the visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the states was involved in almost everything in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we

and it comes back how we talk about things I often remind people um you know the play tell\nUs and that story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we tell about who create value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings us home the\nUS government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion\nDollars and part of that agenda was really also to direct that school stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama finance some companies like a cylinder\nThrough the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nTheir new questions about a
