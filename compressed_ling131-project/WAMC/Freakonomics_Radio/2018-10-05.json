[noise]\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field of sports or music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get it how much of that ability where they born\nHow much is attributable to hard work can practice this is a debate been going on probably forever nature versus nurture raw talent versus what's called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious things come great at anything\nYou need both talent in ... lots of each but even that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because\nAthletic success like any success and leave money failure it's what you might call multi factorial a lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods\nYou really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also end up identical as much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more new ones and then also for interesting so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs grew up in a Marcy projects to a single mother that's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL now he is I multiply multimillionaire\nMarried to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today\nSo why don't we set it up so that all young men\nMust sell drugs when barricades and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York I mean\nHe had a great talent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like\nHe happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in Smith on them like that is\nLike a lot of luck that to me and I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happen that were just happenstance that led me to be physicians and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThere should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance three time major league baseball star\nYes you're at and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best kid on your\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family

pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball star\nYes you are and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best kid on your team\nYou I've played every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always ... uh and I actually enjoy playing basketball more ah I played backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist ... we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son\nThat boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals in ...\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both super than the athletes they both come from very athletic family\nUm published a study where they attract the development of soccer players in Germany that's David obscene and he's talking about the two thousand fourteen World Cup and found that the athletes who went on to the national team which by the way one that World Cup\nUm had played more different sports when they were younger spent more time in self structured or unstructured soccer play when they were younger but not more time in deliberately structured soccer training\nOnly by age twenty two did they start playing fewer sports in spending more time and structured soccer than athletes who plateaued a lower level so this sort of less structured development [noise]\n[noise] and turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become [noise] okay but\nWhat if you are a young athlete or the parents of one\nAnd your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athletes but rather to get into an elite universities like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that's ... my freakonomics friend and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago but\nCalculation about point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nCase though you might say that's a crazy like this college fencing even exist and and the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that offensive but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\n... you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave fencing thing the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says eBay there's Sabre list foil and there's male female fancy\nAnd given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors end up being college fence is not about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit think fencing increases your chances from that point four percent baseline\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else cuts and something like Fifteen\nFold we should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admissions sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school\nForget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like three hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players\nBut the the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned into sensors limit\nExactly one and us so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences at a really good club in Chicago\nAnd I don't know is grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know everybody else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played at Kentucky\nOr do you view would have been and talked to can address\nThe problem was he played at Harvard we'll be right back\n\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target preventing future at heart and

track five AM band as Shawn Johnson told us earlier might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coats and the Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of this freak occurrence my coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese\nUm when he was three years old and he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast\nAnd he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he'll kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China came to the United states\nOpen to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians that were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson who started her training at different gym and I loved it it was awesome but chow my coach that took me the ... opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching me because it saved gas money and I was really really blessed to fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean\nToday's

can thankfully in\nMay that he he can't maintain and I and forever grateful for that\nOh\nShawn Johnson and good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunity is whether if you're bad luck\nWar through something much more concrete like lack of money what were the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year and a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIt's a tournament in California this week of the next week and you go to Nevada and after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could ever afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\nYou you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near that all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on their team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go all those trips and then the coach doesn't favor em and play um\nLauren Murphy is a professional mixed martial arts fighter in the ... weight division of USC\nThey have to work out all the time they need to rest a lot of us work so they're just not a lot of time in the day and a lot of times the first thing that kind of get taken off the plate is time with family\nAnd so I remember missing a couple of Thanksgiving dinners um you know not being able to drive out to my sister's house for Christmas and I remember my family kind of being like what the hell [laughter] why you know why are you suddenly neglecting us so much and ah [noise]\nI I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need to you know make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nThe high school at you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share a\nWhy didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing for baseball you know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime like Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I

and getting ready for football and I\nSell it to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you give it up through the course of your life\n[noise] you shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years\nHe's still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded and\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid at a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and\nInteresting things including friends including family and and then I was like All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players
