and I hit her as hard as I can and she actually fell down I have an eight year old son is no way I'd let them play talking for\nMaybe you are an obsessive sports fan war they'd be more casual fan and you follow just a couple of sports teams or maybe pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV whichever the case when you do see those athletes\nIt's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context\nAs a full grown adult wearing a uniform performing under extraordinary pressure focused on highly specialized task has zero to do with daily life for at least your daily life but is that who those people really are and how they get so good at this thing they do\nWhen you see them on TV all you're seeing the outcome but what were the input

equation\nToday on freakonomics radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war and colonizing Jew or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise San Francisco forty niners and how they have a gun to recover from a debilitating\nLosing streak I mean when you lose a game a lot of noise happens when you lose to a ton happens usually three like Armageddon I'm trying not\nIn today's episode becoming an athlete's\nTime to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened scientific is the process how predictable will look at the number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both super suddenly athletes will look at will determination\nI did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was I'm throwing up\nAnd the mental aspect of this most\nPhysical pursuit well I think the mind is is as big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools will hear stories of opportunities gained\nAnd lost in Nineteen eighty one it was Eighteen forty seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent and we'll hear one story it's almost too good to be true\nThey said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you're going to vote for him you know your everywhere and you just have no idea\n[noise]\n\nGuess freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house even down there\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field sports store music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how would they get so that how much of that ability where they born\nHow much is attributable to hard work can practice this is a debate been going on probably forever nature versus nurture raw talent versus what's called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything\nToo often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious fact come great at anything\nNeed both talent in lots of each but even that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu tore a\nLot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods\nYou really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also ended up identical as much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced than that also interesting [noise] so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs grew up in a Marcy projects to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL\nNow he is I multiply multimillionaire married to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today so why don't we set it up so that all young men\nMust sell drugs when barricades and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York like I I mean he had a great\nTalent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like he happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me see and I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThat should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems\nCrazy so okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but we'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's\nStart with physical ability it may not surprised to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star\nYes you know ... and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete you're going to be the best get on your team\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child\nIn super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and beach volleyball\nOh man well my ... my life has literally then family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both super sadly athletes they both come from very athletic family\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shift friend who was one two and then put gold medals\nMom is ... extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and neck surgery and everything but she's still such an incredible athlete well I mean my dad kind of did\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHe was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he a race ... I mean everything\nOnly by age twenty two did they start playing fewer sports in spending more time and structured soccer than athlete to put into the lower levels so this sort of less structured development [noise]\nAnd turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become like [noise]\nOkay but\nWhat if you are a young athlete or the parents have one\nIn your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athletes but rather to get into an elite universities like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that's ... my freakonomics friend and coauthor he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nMy calculation about point four percent of kids so about one\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think is you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave a fencing team the only exception be my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill this three different blades ... soil and there's male female fancy and given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors end up being college fences about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit thing fencing increases your chances from that point four percent baseline\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else costs than something like Fifteen fold we shouldn't say here that college admissions being what they are\nFencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener\nHow does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school\nForget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like three hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players\nBut that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned to defense or is it\nExactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences that are really good club in Chicago\nAnd I don't know his grades aren't that good so he knows and I know as everyone else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then it was time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played at Kentucky or do you\nView would have been a time to address\nThe problem was he played at Harvard we'll be right back\n\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target

Chinese born and raised Chinese\nUm when he was three years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast\nAnd he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he'll kinda lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian are lumpy ends that were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson had started her training at different gym and I loved it it was awesome but child my coach that took me to you on backs opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching the they had to save gas money and I was really really last fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean\nGiven today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me safe and I am forever grateful for that\n\nSean Johnson's good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nDon't get the right opportunities whether if you're bad luck bore through something much more concrete like lack of money what were the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year and a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen ...\nIt's a tournament in California this week and the next week and you go to Nevada and after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go all those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play them\nI think this that trickle down effect from there there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to pirates off out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players in Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nAnd I remember my family kind of being like what the hell [laughter] why you know why are you suddenly neglecting us so much and ah [noise]\nI I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need to you know make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nIn high school at you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share\nMy didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing for baseball you know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime like Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably in high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that that core slows going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices\nTheir labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like not not going to do\nThat so instead you did with an American studies at American studies when journalism ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while\nPlaying football [laughter] no I um I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready for football and I\nSay I want to say once I got to the league then I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you are given up through the course of your life\n[noise] you shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he's still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends including family and\nAnd then I Will say art I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting I mean I think\nIt's a feeling of loneliness honestly which and it's not like a three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but\nThroughout my life I have been\nAlmost myopic Lee focused on a goal which being focused on that goal I gave me purpose and\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nBut if something to the effect of a when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like I was\nDidn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I\nWas single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I ... the people who are close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has\nA bunch of family and friends friends that she's been close with since they were in the second grade and like and I my\nI don't really have that and like I was making these choices\nAh which I thought were choices to get me what you wanted right and I didn't realize at the time that I was for going like lasting long lasting relationship [noise]\nComing up after the break what does it set you back if you pursue the

and mark to share a and Lauren Murphy bought about the athletes who make the sacrifices but don't make the big time\nJust look at the numbers there are only about Seventeen hundred players in the NFL major league baseball you're if you were the nine hundred the NBA just about five hundred in baseball roughly Ninety percent of the players drafted by major league clubs don't ever make it to the majors\nOne of those Ninety percent was just an Humphries\nYou get a phone call says how does it feel to be the next member of the Houston Astros and you just get you get except the dream come through so I ended up signing\nHe started playing minor league baseball at Eighteen which meant skipping college although he did start taking some courses later on\nIn two thousand nine he retired at age twenty seven without ever making the majors he enrolled at Columbia University and took a sociology class with a professor named Sudhir Venkatesh\nSo I was sitting there in his classroom I started thinking about all the issues are that I'd seen an independent baseball and affiliated baseball\nGuys living check to check struggling with Louis go back to school family life issues at home and I thought if I could use some of the things that we were learning in class talked to some of these guys and find out whether the stories and and things that I was seeing and hearing was reflected in the numbers\nWe followed a sample of the draft class of two thousand and one and so that's the but you know it's ten years\nAnd that is Sudhir Venkatesh\nAnd so we thought that would help us understand what happens to these folks I think one of the most curious things that we find is how much ten years matter so if you take two people who grow up in the same circumstances let's say one played baseball in one day and\nThe person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they enter the game then the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career\nAll right so what kind of background is typical for these players you're tracking the average player\nProbably looks like an upper middle class kid who comes out of college or comes out of high school\nUm and when you follow in upper middle class kid for about seven to ten years they're probably going to make higher than the median average income they're probably going to live in a neighborhood that's relatively safe they're going to have a career now when you take the counterpart among the pool that was drafted that median kid\nThat kid looks like he's making about twenty to twenty four thousand dollars a year\nWhich is not a lot of money um he's working probably five to seven months playing baseball and then struggling to find part time work in the off season might be coaching might be doing some training might be working on a construction site might be working in fast food\nWhen you're twenty five playing an independent ball making less than two thousand dollars a month\nLiving off your parents because you can't financially sustain yourself like that\nAt some point you have to say look I got with no degree I had less than an associate's degree at that point so at some point you tell yourself I Can't do this to myself I Can't do that to my parents and I can't continue when I Know there's ... untapped potential to do other things [laughter]", "year":
