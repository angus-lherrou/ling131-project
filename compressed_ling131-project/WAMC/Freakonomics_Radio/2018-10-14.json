[noise]\n\nIf you happen to live in New York City is I Do there's a name it's been routinely popping up for a few decades now always attached to interesting and often controversial project sure I'm Dan doctor off but don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name\nBut his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states\nYou grew up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but\nHe settled in in his wife started raising their family here he worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces who finds the urban bridges too good to pass up this went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York hot to host the Olympics\nAnd the eventually that that idea became a bit of a movement or it drew the attention of Mike Bloomberg what the time was just an ordinary billionaire and ah I don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined the board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less being there\nWhich as you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well voters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal\nSmart self made fiercely pragmatic and he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about he was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterated in the September eleventh terrorist attack\nLess than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred an eighth mayor\nNow Bloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other news sites to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven or he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDan doctor off did that job for six years\nHe then asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nAnd Bloomberg was finally done being mayor in two thousand

laughed\nAnd all you know it's a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't wanna go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today a CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nOkay let's back up to before the un doctor off was the new one [noise]\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you toil first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nA you've got delayed you wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursued you pursued you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote sounds pretty nutty doesn't it you know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that [noise]\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they use the deadlines at the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite the science of what kind of regional will benefit from\nIt all depends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we used the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive region owning done in time et cetera et cetera\nNow the second question you asked was or we

Stephen ...\nDamn doctor off started his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York then joined the Bloomberg administration helped New York recover from the nine eleven attack\nWho then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today one of his project at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr off is chairman of president [noise]\nShed I'm just curious about the the why ... why did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts fiend at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea and the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this area on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards\nWe wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for one that should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard because there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York um the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem that let us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible both pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer something us\nIt's exactly right it's like a transformers really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth or what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phone even Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather to shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental ... of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of a big city like New York that's\nGreat way of saying it you know another way of expressing as cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it taste technologies trends begin to change\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nAnd I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public park and strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me that\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble and the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and amenity\nI Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox in that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because the government is really hard um and just getting anything done and often takes extraordinary effort\nOr but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or New Jersey city to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave the using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system\nAnd basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives uh to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the ...\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nFive companies to come ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world you know it's sort of this optimistic sense that produces incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that most places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nAnd from Amtrak's fall foliage trip to the board Amtrak's empire service\nNew York city through the

anguish calls to regulate huge tech firms known collectively as gas Google Amazon Facebook\nCompany for ... for a minute I Would\nHave to grow up the capacity to manipulate the controller to control the information was delivered to control the pricing it which products were delivered to us to control as producers\nThe gas companies are far bigger richer and arguably more dominant than tech

prime members in the U.S something like Seventy five percent of all American households\nIt's estimated that almost fifty percent of all online spending goes to Amazon\nThis kind of scale creates a lot of concern we've examined this concern in previous episodes like who runs the Internet and use the Internet being ruined\nWe're seeing the birth of a new center of power real power we depend on these technologies that have been in many ways wonderful and fascinating but they're making significant decisions you know laterally\nThere's also the question of whether the mission abused firms uses

[noise] so here's a question if you are one of those huge dominant super wealthy for what would you do to ensure that the good times state [noise]\nProbably spend a lotta money lobbying politicians which yes they do there's been a huge ramping up lately and lobbying like tech for [noise] but you might\nAlso do something a bit subtle and\nAre storing today begins with a journalist I'm Franklin for a writer with the Atlantic\nYou are one of three brothers who write books are talking about that for just a minute and the family that produced all of you\nRight so I have two brothers Johnathan he's written a good number of novels including everything is limited and I got a younger brother named Josh who is a science writer who wrote a book called moon walking\nWith Weinstein and it's actually incredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because ah I'm sure it in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being\nThree brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her own accomplishments right but uh you know\nParents didn't do anything they didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day and or or sit down and study the great chess master [laughter] we watched a lot of heat man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut one of the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to spend essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card that will at the book shop\nAnd so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in journalism was late one of the very first mainstream online publications would just start by Microsoft and so there was this huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes\nThere was a certain amount of utopian isn't associated with the emergence of the Internet this idea that we were gonna tied the world together I Love search engines I Love the fact that I can access every book in human history in a nanosecond I Love\nThat I can get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things arguably make life much better\nAnd maybe in arguably make life much better so these technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle an incredible invention the pad and yeah and I found were incredible innovations and so I think we were right to marvel at them\nSo after rating for sleep for a while you moved on to the New Republic or as you call it the intellectual Oregon for hard nosed liberalism you ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nThe New Republic but this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist\nOregon and managed to persist over a hundred years well never really turning a profit and so as we entered the Internet age that became more and more difficult thing to continue to do and so\nWe ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next and I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up\nResigning his editor but then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommates\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've got struck me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nAlmost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media who had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back and I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd the relationship and the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nYeah we became really good friends and it was ... and we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and then maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris\nDecided that he'd always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we start chasing cliques in two thousand Thirteen the sure its way to get clicks was opposed to clip from last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and you slap a headline on it and you may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine and then if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school to suddenly find yourself producing things that are extremely popular\nYou become obsessed with replicating that popularity in ... in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to master social media and this new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you were about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job and was offering other people jobs that they do republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to replicate it over and over again\nYeah that's completely right I felt like it in retrospect I realized that I was just living this compressed version of recent history\nThe recent history of the Internet at least over the years Franklin for his view of the Internet it shifted the same guy who used to think this\nThere was a certain amount of utopian is
