Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America we are not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing\nSome of our attention on the platform monopolies and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the question is if it was um\nWas our work a new American problematic for Google Google ... uh Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the board at Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years he stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also a CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself\nBetween Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this is the relationship that goes back to the very early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination\nEuropean antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website ... congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we released this statement in support of the decision and Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty five I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times they're headline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision to reconsider around and if it could not be reconsidered I asked for more time I was told that neither of those was possible\nThe writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn's open markets Institute told us simpler version of events he made it clear that lens statement about the European regulators decision\nThis was something that was a bit too far for Google and New America was very generous than supporting me and they never did anything to interfere

acts in a very decreased performance\nI've defined choking as worst performance then you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation and that's the on by luck I'm a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\n[noise] so I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people engaging regularly and we're we're most likely to choke\nI really think that any

UFO give the best into view of the week ... is an economist at the University of California San Diego that would have made me very nervous that would have made me\nPut more effort into this when we look at the incentives in comics we think about two ways in which it's going to affect us ... that you pay you more you're put more effort\nInto task and the second to some music more effort will lead to better performance and that's not necessarily true and that's the part of choking might be that\nI can push you so much to to try so hard to to really actually backfire you'll eat perform worse\nCan easy coauthored one of the foundational economics papers on choking it's called large states and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've got struck me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nIs in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months' salary in our experiment if they did perfectly well\nEach participant completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead creative one was for example to pack pieces of metal into into books in an efficient way\nSome tasks we're cognitive and memory game in which I Would read up numbers you listen to me and then at some point do say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic\nThrowing a dark like ... balls so balls on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars\nAnd ten daughter was about what they made in a month over there I open to to agree with me to six months of paid a lot of money that would make you work much harder riots and the question was are you going to be better actually when you were Carter\nAs can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics the higher pay leads to more effort and more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nSo the findings were striking UC reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in large success rate when the incentives were really high\nFor the three digit memory game roughly forty percent of the participants succeeded under low incentives under high incentives the success rate which is twenty percent\nTo the dark ballgame the success rate under low incentives was ten percent and runs seven percent under high incentives for the metal packing game under low incentives twenty five percent of the participants succeeded\nUnder high incentives nobody's succeeded or put another way at least twenty five percent of them choked\nActually were a bit surprised by this experiment because we included tasks in which we expected that effort will it will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure so can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks make us succumb to pressure\nThey ran some more experiments at MIT using students as a research subject some experiments involved simple manual tasks like punching alternating keyboard keys as fast as possible\nIt's really something that you know if you're doing it for long enough it's boring so he felt pay you more you'll try may be harder and we believed it more effort will actually increase your performance\nOther tasks we're more cognitive like adding numbers and ...\nWhen you think about ... probably a rich your automobile have your your best soon and very fast and now I find really really making it high incentives you might actually started being you know distracted\nOnce again there were low and high incentive versions of each task since a dollar doesn't go far in\nStreaming support

anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nOr what we found is that for the keep pressing to ask when you increase the incentives from opt to search dogs dropped to three hundred dollars they sweet for about a forty percent succeeding to eighty percent succeeding\nOn the other end when you have to add up numbers more comity one would see a sharp decrease from sixty five percent to forty percent\nSo when you actually have to put some cognitive effort into do get into the incentives to be ridiculously high could actually be a better idea\n[noise]\nThis would seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves some thinking\nWe're more susceptible to choke\nPoor probably heard from a lot of people over the years coach and teachers and counselors of all sorts you are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out of the way [noise]\nBut that's obviously harder than it sounds so how can you do that how can you prepare yourself to not crumble\nUnder the very circumstances that matter most\nHow do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic\nSee on by luck again going back to her Gulf experiments so we investigated whether going quicker for example um might help eliminate poor performance under pressure or I'm having one key swing thought that encapsulates your entire stroke\nMight be better um and we showed that some of that was successful and that leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess your buddy up on on the back now you can say that with a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great ... so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else can you tell us about in this domain at least I'm learning to joke\nWith we also showed that getting used to that type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes with performance can be helpful so really inoculated yourself against the high pressure situations you see this with students who practice taking time pass a\nUC that's with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions that are going to perform under and you even see that if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players are used to what it's going to feel like to be in that big stadium um\nAnd this is true in\nReally big important situation but it's it's also true in those little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it while people are watching you know um and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets
