accident that it's taken by the United states has repercussions are\nEverywhere are across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time uh has to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from the skies in an ambient that was a a knock ripe and then found a direction that didn't that that was not there he is the result of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and the if you don't understand the forces or that put him there I think that's part of getting the wrong diagnoses and I have to tell you there's a lot of sympathy for some things that are said uh owned a part of the United states\nThat are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO as opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that tariffs are a really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where tariffs exists under a different name one of the U.S is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version and their their governments subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar [noise]\nDo you the WTO have any ability\nTo direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time industries like protection they want to be supported by the government is they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call behind the border protection\nA and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of or insufficient enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because terrorists you can measure\nThe Arabs you include on your spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the border measure you don't know when they come you know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a communities are hearing the W. job will discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nAnd not really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or

Brazil and you've studied electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here had those three factors Brazilian engineering\nAnd being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um\nWell the good thing about being a a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse prospective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspects of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important ah aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife uh and uh she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nBoats that abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a\nLove story in its own rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering lake solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to

some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that you're forever learning how to ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case released another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there is an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed countries that do trade and that have a a cooperative\nRelationship with other partners they essentially gain from that but it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors into domestic economy will lose me

love crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand sex\nThousands every means at my God Curtis dot com\nThere and the ... you cannot ignore that\nI think what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things fester we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for a government sent for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they arm or they have a role of course but the minor\nIn this structural change and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than the help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully in succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand uh the situation and reached the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio with your host Stephen ...\nSo I wouldn't say that my pop economics was through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economists which one was definitely Carl Marx\nMary on among the Cato\nI'm a professor and the economics of innovation on public value at University College London\nYou also advised as far as I can tell a number of governments in governmental institutions\nShorts I'm currently on the council of economic advisors for the first minister Scotland and also the special adviser for ... their research commissioner in the European Union and I used to be on the advisory board offered Jeremy I'm ...\nAnd I resigned because of breakfast\nIt's sheer special advisor to the secretary general of the CDs that right yeah so the\nOnly city is currently rethinking its economic narrative and so they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that\nGotcha and also um ... advisory panel in Finland is that true\nOh yeah probably I don't really want to the whole it yes [laughter] there's actually even like thirty more [noise]\nGoing to be the one university economists Europe so many governments and institutions for a clue let's get back to why much Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about Martin says that he's known as a critic of capitalism but actually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic\nOf capitalism which is technological change\nWe shouldn't forget that futile ism was five hundred years of inertia one of the defining features of capitalism is a fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of laws that it's constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution and consumption work and marks really talks about that\nBut it's quite curious that one of the you know most of them at the critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic kind of always and knocked what got me interested in economics of technological\nChange but it's not just technological change interests much cut out she has a relatively radical stance on the value that created by technological change\nWhat do I mean by radicals\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hardest dot com and no choke no poll

her family in London in an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T um where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine\nYou said well a very expensive that's the one I saw that the glass of wine you ordered costs forty pounds I made\nThey made an error you well I didn't write this is how they treat you know they trick you they trick you I don't know if it's because I was a woman and they didn't show me the price you know today gentlemen or if it's what that does but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw and it turned out to be the most expensive one that\nGot anyone who read that article to call me a\nSoviet ... social [laughter] right\nSo to someone who says you know free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nThe first is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith a you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFree from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic might say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active a visible hands or the state\nMy point is actually the state to listen to the ball and almost everything in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but\nThe role that public after it's played was really across the whole innovation\nChain so you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation\nBut also a agencies more downstream doing applied research like a dark chocolate sister organization in more recent times called ARPA e the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nUncertain high risk a research\nSome evidence of the government funding that much ... is talking about DARPA or the defense advanced research Projects Agency created during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet is over the years produced\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an

starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested more than a hundred and thirty million dollars studying the extraction techniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health has helped fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy the FDA [noise]\nThese public institutions have absolutely co created value is quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the copy Larry\nUh that one uses so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating and enabling business it's really about taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and closet government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in return how big of a problem is that\nSo it's a huge problem and it comes back how we talk about things I often remind people um you know Plato [laughter] a sad story teller ruled the world\nSo these stories that we tell about who create value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home\nThe U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars\nAnd part of that agenda was really also to direct that fiscal stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama financed some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nOr new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder makes solar energy panels what is the taxpayers have to be the one footing the bill to try to shift a shift on power or solar power works\nPeople said my God the government would a basket case group of\nThey don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of you know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way on which first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of a U.S government financing early on\nBut more concretely at the same time that it with financing cylinder and also financed Tesla for a very similar amount of money so the tests last car got a four hundred and sixty five million
