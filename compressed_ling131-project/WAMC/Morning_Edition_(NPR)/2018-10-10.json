how to intervene Potter says this is hard work but not impossible\nWe've already done high anyway anti drunk driving\nDecades back most people were uncomfortable taking a friend's keys when they're

kind of culture change is just getting started\nBut look around and you'll find examples one of the teenage boys meeting in the basement says that as a high school freshmen he's already used these

executives at Exxon Mobil and announce that the company will contribute one million dollars over the next two years to support a campaign for a tax on carbon based fuels so I kind of different could this make on efforts to reduce the effects of climate change Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nExxon Mobil contribution will support a group called Americans for carbon dividends an offshoot of the climate leadership council its aim is to raise the price of fossil fuels to reduce their use and cut the amount of climate changing carbon released into the atmosphere\nExxonMobil has voiced support for such a plan for years but Greg brutal scent of the climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is it significant step\nIt's the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nOther words a direct tax on carbon though bird will soon group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that

edu\nPrefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later burden says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why doesn't oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment we're operating\nIn what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions fertile since says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon evidence plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen\nJames Baker the third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully ... to consumers\nBurton says the idea has received a positive reception from both parties on Capitol Hill\nWith Republicans in particular there's an increasing number of members of Congress on on the Republican side that are looking to seriously engage on this issue\nOf course many Republicans are skeptical about both taxes and climate change I think it is a step\nThat's Vin Weber a former congressman from Minnesota he's now a lobbyist and political consultant at Mercury Public affairs but ... says where the president and the White House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating it are Republicans today to embrace any new tax is difficult and since President Trump was elected particularly attacks that focuses on fossil fuels is even more difficult\nGreg Myrtle sudden acknowledges the challenges and says the carbon tax has always been viewed as a longer term effort\nNPR's John Ydstie on NPR News [noise]\nThat's Mississippi
