the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us\nTo get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how differently the tone was of the two

women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the inter ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day

into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women banker well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and\nThe disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's almost impossible\nFor us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been\nThe leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about meat you one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill whose testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a raised\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past two years\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so is women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often

health insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about at sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan and twenty fourteen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people and all sorts of insurance\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOffensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Marilyn Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a math nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWow and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hard ball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world and she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case she had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called them the union to campaign against a hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state why they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs\nOrg ... falafel restaurant right back from local farmers markets

the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of
