Jared Kushner\nAnd I'm up in ... when the crown prince I'm In Saudi Arabia or so it it would really be tough for Trump personally or to do anything that would want to damage this relationship with this one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at an in another country\nTo stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm UC what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier a presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist and Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase the pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's individual meeting with President pollutant in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore um\nLook I mean you and I can say that it is horrific um\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in the American allies conflict abroad by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk\n'em I think the same thing is likely to occur visa V. Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or at it after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about the enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together\nIs the government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that surprising in some way\nUm it again it's it's gotten worse certainly\nUm but he's been threatened before um you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a lot of his friends who were opponents of the Saudi regime a he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a a real problem\nFor the Saudis the Saudis overreacted to the Canadians are when the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that were detained or in the Ritz Carlton there were some reports of torture when addicts\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nJust point you to North Korea I mean Trump expressing his love for Kim Jong il and who is by far the most criminal behavior we've seen in\nThe river will have a fair thanks so much for joining us you heard him on NPR News\nThis is ...
