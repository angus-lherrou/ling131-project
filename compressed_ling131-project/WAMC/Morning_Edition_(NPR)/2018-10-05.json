nine thirty when we take you to special coverage from NPR in the Senate procedural vote on judge Brett Kavanaugh there will be appropriate\nDiscussion before as a reminder\nThis is your radio station every one right now Alan three hundred thirty three thousand six hundred sixty six dollars no lock box look this is what we do best and how much did you say is in a lot bucks David three hundred and thirty three thousand six hundred sixty six on the way to five hundred thousand before the honor and Dr October Fifteen\nSo in other words the big moment is coming when we start to fund drive we need to be at five hundred thousand dollars this morning we'll start at eight you'll have been able to hear National Public radio ... to ... hours just to repeat anyway\nBut if you want to you could go and you could listen to it at NPR dot org I'm sure but we're going to be doing the panel early because there's so much to talk about\nAnd it also is representative of how strong this radio station is that when something like this comes up to the Senate vote people are massing in the streets people in New York City in front of Trump Tower\nIn Washington DC at the Senate office building you know the hypocrisy of some of these people who said that they don't like what Trump saying they don't like what Kavanaugh's saying you see Kevin all of this morning doing an op ed piece\nStreaming support for

shouldn't have said that he was talking as a dad and as the sun is a husband\nSorry no go you have John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice who would come out in favor of capital who is now saying no no based on what I saw that day I Can't support the may\nAnd now we're about to see the people like flavor can Susan Collins and Murkowski and what they're going to say\nAnd I suspect they're going to all say yes because they know that they don't want to lose a Republican primary flake of course will be not running again but he wants to run for president and he knows those Republicans are solidly behind Trump he may know Trump is no good Nick but that's not going to change the way in which\nHe votes on the floor today\nSo it does look to me like they've orchestrated there's they have a Washington Post article by Kevin ... said\nThat that takes over the edge of it and say yeah maybe I said some things I shouldn't have said maybe I did it the wrong way but I've said on our panel in the morning and I said I thought he would go through and of course I still think that\nWas the head towards this showdown vote today on the kind of an outcome formation Allen one question what would have been the huge issue with speaking another conservative well they could\nDo that they don't want to they want to get this thing done Cavanaugh is a young man and he'll be there for another Thirty years and people will every time he opens if you have to be saying you know you remember that remember what you said it's not smart politics the last thing they want to do is go through this after\nThere has been a flipping of the house of representatives which by the way\nTo the Democrats which by the way is no sure thing I'll tell you right now so I'm going to depend on turnout and the Republicans have now been energized by the Kavanaugh thing and we are seeing evidence that\nThings may be turning around in their favor so if somebody is really strong on this they got to come out and they got to vote and they've got to have their say\nMeantime President Trump held another rally time in Minnesota where he went after Al Franken who left as a result of food sexual accusations and believe six women saying to the crowd great cheer Z folded like a wet rag\nWell look you know he's well known to know there's always got to be an enemy he'll pick on people hill bully them he's been a bully all his life and he's going to be a bully now and it works in terms of his core constituency with all that\nAnd we'll just continue to do it hey look he got himself elected president the United states and he's not about to change his stripes that's for sure\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo Allen saying yesterday that she hasn't decided yet whether to accept the nomination of the working families\nParty or the race for governor of course we've been talking about this for the past couple of weeks now the working families party of course back actors Cynthia Nixon after a split with the progressive leaning minor party\nSo let's get inside of Andrew Cuomo said if we can always a dangerous thing\nTo do with anybody but you know he wanted that nomination they didn't give it to them they gave it to sit in next and now he's leading in the\nPolls by two to one the smart thing of of course will all come together and I'll accept the nomination but instead he said I haven't decided whether it's a little bit and not and that of\nShows this sort of almost Trump being this temper you know my friend one of my friends for now make you suffer he'd be pretty stupid not to take it because he does a lot of those votes going somewhere else I don't like the fact that the working families party is\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family
