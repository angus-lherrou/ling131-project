Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump says he the each of these waves that connected to to the previous\nWell he does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all of these connected because you could make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump went on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one he\nWas I mean in a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when you try to get them to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats are poor the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nDay one of the WAMC on air fall fund drive is next with Alan and re\nThis is Northeast Public radio WAMC F.
