we vote on November ...\nMaybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child over the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring his conversations about personal questions or anxieties that shaped election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with Rachel Martin\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me I first I Would say hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know I'll let you know as I was reading in bed you know is\nVery heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on was there a rock bottom for him\nRight away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're while taking his grandfather my father yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh\nThe state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore\nSo he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right yes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had ... for short period of time\nAnd he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have no\nFor almost three years and you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody it was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are ... and he cried and I think maybe that planted that seed because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program [noise]\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now\nIt's a it's a process [noise]\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours where you and your son have endured this but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it and why did my son have to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not right now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons\nAnd we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the day sometimes are you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change\nAnd I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why is or help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat\nAnd to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be\nSomeone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem that means Isabel your your whoever won once President Trump especially wants to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with\nHow he has done in the job in the past couple of years I'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\nOh I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord it's like if he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants\nNow in all the debt scored it's like he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants it's best for America and I really truly believe that that he can't help himself\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas\n... I'll just closed by asking you how things are between\nYou and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nIt's a strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I got it back to my last breath\nAbout thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there to Isabel Simon\nAnd this is NPR News\n... is a thirty six year old former marine who signed up after nine\nThe verse so paper mill in Jay\n... is a thirty six year old former marine who signed up after nine eleven and served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq in an interview at a nearby hospital golden said his top issue is health care\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the ADA a very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that first Parkland voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage that position has been attacked\nA Republican incumbent Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold medal of government control your health care ending Medicare as we know it still billing taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you when I really object you is all of this state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters in all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine and attacked me and say I'm some you know not\nGolden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for a pillow see for speaker saying it's time for new leadership in that same debate pollock when whom Trump endorsed for reelection in a tweet refused to state whether he voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThat's my business I work with everybody Republicans and Democrats as a business professional but I Do not tell anybody way before\nI ask golden if he thinks Democrats should serve as a check on Trump if they win the majority I don't view\nMy role as resistance I like to say I'm a marine no better friend no worst enemy if the president does something helps Maine I'm with him if he does something hurts Maine I'm gonna I'm gonna stick up for our state\nAccording to the center for Responsive Politics the two major candidates and parties and political action committee supporting them have dropped over eight million dollars into the district\nTo independence in the race or not expected to be a factor but could be because of a wild card may now has ranked Joyce voting and federal elections mark brewer is a political science professor at the University of Maine\nIf you were to go and get your ballot um today and vote you would be you'd be given the option to rank those four candidates one through four one being your top choice and for being your last choice\nIs no candidate received a majority the last place finisher is eliminated their votes would then go to whomever they eliminated Kennedy's voters ranked as their second choice no one knows for certain how this will play out in public when has refused to say whether he'll honor the results should he lose\nBrian Naylor NPR News Lewiston, Maine [noise]\n\n\nThis is NPR News this is Paul\nTaught he'll WAMC pioneer valley bureau chief democratic US Senator Elizabeth Warren and Republican Jeff deal out of the debate in western Massachusetts at the studios of WBUR GB why\nMr deal wants to go to Washington to be a cheerleader for Donald Trump well I think we've seen again that my opponent is fixated on Donald Trump's fixated on the White House and not your house\nSupport for streaming on WAMC comes from the Davis financial group providing the base financial planning and wealth management services to individuals families and business owners and the pioneer valley and beyond Davis financial G.

I came across for example in in one city the city of weeks that was closer to the border with bought 'em all the people [noise]\nUh I remember the mayor saying that they had eight people could accept the trips to to go home again voluntary repatriation and among that group it was people who just found that their children were unable to continue with the trip [noise]\nUm [noise] but it it just seems like those numbers in in every destination when we would ask the mayor's would say is just a small number it was always less than\nA usually less than a hundred that would that would take up this offer of of leaving the trip\nAnd what makes them determined to reach the United states as opposed to safety in Mexico\nUm interesting question to everyone says that are in the United states they can get ahead faster people they they say multiple factors for leaving violence poverty\nA and also family reunification so there's a combination of people that their parents or their children are in the United states and they want to reach them and see them again they hadn't seen them for years in some cases that the appeal of the U.S the ... they will say swing you American or the the ability to make in an hour in the United states would they would make it", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "30"}
