are just days away from the mid term election and President Trump has laid his bets on immigration as the issue that will drive Republicans to the polls\nOr at least his hardcore supporters late last week the administration reportedly floated the idea of an executive order that would bar all migrants including those seeking asylum from entering the United states at the southern border then came the announcement on Monday to the Pentagon is deploying more than five thousand troops to the border and then yesterday\nCame the idea of scrapping a key piece of the fourteenth amendment what's known as birthright citizenship through an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits ... it's ridiculous and it has to end\nA couple of false statements their most notably that the United states is one of more than thirty notions with birthright citizenship\nAlso worth noting overturning a constitutional amendment is really really difficult to advocates is an NPR White House correspondent and co host of the politics podcast and joins us now give money to him the morning so if the president the anti immigrant method something that resonates with Republicans writ large or is it is about really what Steve said his personal base

coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of its relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota\nAt a recent job is changing her political identity did I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually live in the Bible\nBecause I don't know I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play that I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want people coming to our country and and some of the most\nStreaming support for WAMC from from birch are Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success would weave district to

people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there is another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I've been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I did how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snow flakes and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and\nSupport for streaming on WAMC comes from the Davis financial group providing fee based financial planning and wealth management services to individuals families and business owners and the pioneer valley and beyond Davis financial G.

country we often don't understand the motive that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people president\nTrump who visited the ten o'clock yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his defense of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assessment that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her for historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of arguments a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal you know so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nA rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because a logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitic\nHer father and use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump has personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest people [noise] you know when they talk about they talk about the lead you ever see the elite\nHer as when people are encouraged to resent the elite\nJews get nervous the danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and\nHe has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments of hatred in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidents has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life

what's happening\nThe quarterly earnings report that came out early yesterday morning\nIt was delivered by there the new CEO Larry cult took over less than a month ago number one and this affects shareholders is that\nThey've whittled down that dividend all the way down to one penny per share in the last year it's gone from twenty four cents back in November of twenty Seventeen\nThey cut it in half first twenty four down at twelve cents and now it's down to just one penny per share some people are scratching their heads saying why they keep to share this is a source of income for many shareholders for decades relied on these dividend payouts\nTo pay bills and for you know cost of living dealing with their bills so and then more specifically to Schenectady and this was the bulk of his earnings report yesterday by the new CEO he talked about taking their power division and breaking into\nAnd power is something that as recently as last year was headquartered in Schenectady it's not anymore and we learned a little bit more why yesterday called talked about how the issues within power are taking up almost all of his time saying everything's on the table now most notably about this the problems with power\nIs that you know the reason they have to cut their dividends so much as some financial problems there have been attributed to the power issues and apparently there was some acknowledgement yesterday that they've previously over calculated the value of the power to vision by twenty two billion dollars\nSo the latest earnings include a what's called a goodwill impairment charge of twenty two billion\nBasically acknowledging this over calculation\nAnd that is almost all of their twenty three billion dollar loss that they reported yesterday for now they've broken into two divisions also one division will be that gas segment which is there\nYou know gas turbine product services et cetera that is the operation that was based in Schenectady and has the lion's share of some of their personnel the other segment will involve nuclear and grid solution that cetera\nIn August you may recall they started cutting some jobs at power in Schenectady about two hundred and twenty five good jobs fortunately they still have four thousand jobs they are good jobs it draws people from all around the region\nAnd it's one of the best employers around but to say that there's some nerves involved in this would be an understatement the last part of this is as part of his report yesterday but he said the U.S securities and Exchange Commission is expanding its ... of of issues with energy and power\nAnd now also the U.S department of justice started his own investigation so we don't know what that means but it's a little distressing to I think all parties

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and and restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with\nAnd restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I were to Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite\nPresident Trump correct and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and not coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I have been avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all

and scared\nThat how many of these cells honorable and they all raised their hands and that was it the floodgates open and they were all presenting the air you know what emotion they were going through and I think they had a hard time processing but I told them that's okay because adults are having a hard time processing\nOne of her eighth grade students said she was concerned about the attack on the synagogue would soon be forgotten because mass shootings have become a regular part of life\nAnd I didn't know what to say to her sometimes the teacher\nDoesn't know what to say but then

from justice they've been active in marches for refugee and immigrant rights she says they're now connecting those movements to their own Jewish history\nThey have felt very strongly about this because they know from studying the Holocaust how the doors are shut on them\nAvi Baron Monroe is the head of the school she says well older students process their grief through learning and

you for all those people who've been thinking about amending the constitution to change the electoral college\nThey all know everybody knows that while this may be a commendable thing you just don't sign a piece of paper if you're a president didn't say I abolished the fourteenth amendment which reads by the way\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state where they reside so in other words\nThis is really a bunch of nonsense now\nA lot of people are going to say well you know he's right that shouldn't be I say we shouldn't have an electoral college but it doesn't mean you can change the constitution by simply signing an executive order and he knows that of course\nSuch constitutional scholars is former solicitor general who's a bomb in ... and even Kellyanne Conway husband\nWrote an op ed piece a he's a conservative lawyer suggesting that this is other nonsense well they cut it out Kellyanne Conway herself probably in reaction to the husbands op ed piece suggesting that the president was a good guy nothing new here\nIs the kind of desperation that he sees as you see he's going around to all these southern states working like crazy to try to get some Republicans elected in what looks like the Democratic win in many states including Arizona in a senatorial race\nSo it does appear that he's a panic and that he's doing what he thinks he needs to do\nWhile the vice president Mike Pence rejected any link between the president's rhetoric and recent hate crimes and political violence saying quote it's important that we don't connect those acts to the public debate\nOr it's ridiculous I mean the fact of the matter is that disguised as a divider and chief that he's proud of it he's talked about it he's bragged about it he said that this is the way that he operates and of course for parents who sees himself as next up in any case look if the president is impeached pen says the president\nSo he doesn't want to make a misstep here and in any way alienate this president because if you do he'll turn on you like a rabid dog and we all know that so Pence is doing what he's supposed to do and is there any surprise certainly not\nThe ripple effect of these recent tragedies in New York and the political scene the governor's race Marcus mowing are all the Republican Alan calling basically for civility pledge an ending negative ads up until the election unless the governor is way ahead in the race in the polls\nThreat the government's gonna when governor is really doing extraordinary well in the polls it's a as I've said over and over again it was a failed candidacy from the very beginning Lookout Mountain arrow and he's a good guy\nNevertheless you that a president who was Grosvenor was unpopular in New York state I don't know about other states with the shoe will be a blue wave in New York and we'll see what happens but mowing arrow did a bad thing in order to win in order to have come even close he would've had to go after Trump\nAnd say I'm a different kind of Republican in New York state and he didn't want to do that and his own people and Cox and everybody else have been doing what they had to do to support the president and he wasn't going to step out a lot and it was the only way a good one\nLook in Charlie Baker in Massachusetts says put some distance between himself and the president sure he supports Republicans you know in statewide races but we still have the republic rat and he is and he's the extremely well his approval ratings are in the seventies and that's a very different thing than a what mowing arrow is doing in New York\nAnd certainly different than the highly watched

don't ever understand them out if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say hit the Vince of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal thing is I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest me [noise] you know what are they talking about they talk about\nThe early ...\nHer says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether in Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fan the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nThe hatred and if in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi ... might have been very isolated but now have these platforms and what they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's cost or an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing strategy and not just for the holidays from member station WBHM easy in Chicago Suzie on reports\nAnd a pop up Halloween store in downtown

dead Halloween shopping is big business it's expected to generate nine billion dollars this year and pop shops are all about getting some of that retail dollar Courtland ... general manager of Chicago costume\nAnd people are looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know what it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nHe says in the past they've opened as many as eat pop up shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords used to shine short term leases that Steve Short with commercial real estate service Jay allows says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercials spaces CEO Mohammed oh washing says everyone using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich also push coming from ... to regret and we walked in the bus which on that and we've seen a lot of celebrities you know like fingers and performers function their own brand\nHe says record labels have even set up pop up centered around a specific artist oh watched as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease but now that more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional model for long term is in your ... by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop up into turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is a solution ... right now the short term is than your long term\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more attractive than long term retail leases friend piano\nGerm when it comes to pop ups landlords
