News I'm David Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration well other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether the registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty

political machines\n[noise] what about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course like men were given the right to vote in the fifties amendment in Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of right of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel Carson from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself as secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and then thinking about recusing himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy payment short and I live in a lot of ... when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nBecause I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the region Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law which does require a current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and planning I see irony that the nation to original residents are being questioned about their
