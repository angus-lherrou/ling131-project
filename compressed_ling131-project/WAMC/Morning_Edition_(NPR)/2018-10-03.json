the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recall to them earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and an America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa ... from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process and then how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations residents who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they've been rejected but the first within the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his ship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan now\nStreaming

failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove that Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly know\nA dead end the Senate failed to go along and that pretty much ended the idea of removing the justice for political reasons and that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth of Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is

nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nIn the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the ... on this station is conducting a test of the emergency

presidential alert from FEMA ruin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about the writing of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the war\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her effect that the president might be using such as for political purposes or trade version of the presidency was under threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure it'd be so one thing about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and it wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFamous says that accusation is baseless\nIn a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded well there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message and
