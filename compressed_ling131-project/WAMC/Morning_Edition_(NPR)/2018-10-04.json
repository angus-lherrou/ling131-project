William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a court remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were very very big you know there were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it's a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to

health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon after\nA few of them are cut things chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most of the\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind the pay is it you know at the at that age\nBut then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed

seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is\nThe shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need\nFor health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the air strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states that control that part of the country do they have\nEnough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Rocca\nSuch as bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs
