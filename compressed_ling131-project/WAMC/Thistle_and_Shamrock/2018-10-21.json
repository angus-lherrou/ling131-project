Republicans have embrace would cost Massachusetts more than two billion dollars every single year and repeal their protections for people with preexisting conditions this really matters\nOr warn thank you and the next question does start when you talk about Social Security played so there are Fifteen Years on health Social Security is expected to pay eighty cents on the dollar you see a way to fix the system to avoid those benefits being working\nSo I appreciate the question but I actually think the frame a little bit with respect to send the wrong place\nThe Republicans just gave away a trillion and a half dollars to giant corporations and billionaires through a tax scam\nAnd now the debt has one and what if the Republicans said it's the appropriate response now it's time to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block\nThat the Republican plan not wait not strengthen it put it on the chopping block so let me just stop right here and say I will never vote to cut Social Security I Will never vote to cut Medicare these are ... programs that people have paid for it that they are entitled to\nThe idea that the Republicans are running a scam saying we're going to give billions of dollars oh wait a giant corporations that now have\nRecord tax and ... a record profits\nAnd then turn around and take it out on the backs of people who collect Social Security and rely on Medicare\nWe don't need to cut Social Security and Medicare we need to expand it\nI have already introduced legislation I introduced ... years ago just say as we need to move forward on making Social Security stronger financially but make sure it's there for every one of our seniors after a lifetime hard work you should be entitled to that\nTime thank you very much or do you see a way to fix the system so that benefits to Social Security won't be renting\nHappening right now in fact my opponent has vowed to repeal the very mechanism that is revealing Social Security and Medicare the tax reform of two thousand Seventeen which she voted against which she has vowed to repeal\nHas now created new jobs has created increase wages that create the payroll taxes that go into refill now we as a country are starting to see in just a year the effects of the tax reform bill giving us\nFour point one GDP record unemployment fifty years since we've had unemployment at the level it's at now Massachusetts is actually leading the national number on unemployment Massachusetts has benefited greatly eighty percent of Massachusetts residents received a tax cut\nBecause of this tax reform bill but Senator Warren joined a Nancy Pelosi and calling it crumbs saying that the people were\nNot getting what they were they were do which is finally a break from federal government so we're seeing people now having more jobs are having higher wages and in Massachusetts are state revenues exceeded one point two billion dollars in an anticipated tax revenue because of all the investment companies are putting into it and by the way I Want to add my wife and I\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll Doug harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and

businesses Ninety percent of businesses in our country our twenty employees are lower their\nEntire thank you and your about oh a Senator Warren some people have suggested raising the retirement age than Seventy two as a solution to this one thing\nI think that's the wrong approach I think the right approach is that we put the money into Social Security that it takes to meet our obligations but let's be clear what the Republicans want to do is just run a scam on the American people\nAnd the scam start like cutting revenues to the federal government\nYou know the idea that somehow the federal government's getting richer check the facts on this the death it's going up and the Republicans are saying openly this is even a secret time to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block\nThat people what they depend on\nSo for me this one is easy this tax break with a scam from the beginning\nExxon alone one company gets more in tax breaks the Ninety five percent of all the people in the commonwealth of Massachusetts those breaks didn't go to small businesses they went to giant businesses because that's who the Republicans want government to work for\nEverything they have in your about all the same question and raising the retirement age to Seventy two is that something you would be in favor of\nNo it's not something we should do in fact government is taking in record revenue they've never taken in more tax revenue than before however what's needed is sending someone to Washington that's going to also do the upper part of cutting spending now\nOn ... I took on special interest to repeal the index gas tax when I knew that we were wasting\nBillions of dollars of taxpayer money it wasn't going where it was supposed to fifty percent of the gas tax at the time was going to the MBTA which had six billion dollars of deferred maintenance their pension fund was upside down they were asking us to fact fill it over and over again one year we found out a year later the twenty five million dollars had been stolen\nBy a fund manager that worked for the MBTA pension fund then went to work for another company\nOr to take that money so look government has the revenue and you just have the fiscal discipline to try to make sure it's been where it's supposed to go that's why you need to send someone who is willing to stand up to things like the Olympics center to warn her rating on cutting spending zero\nHave to leave it there thank you and the next question does go he represented if President Trump who you've said he supported\nHas called people name he's called them horse eighth on Twitter he's called the plate you ethnic slurs name calling and personal attacks that are common in Washington these days later the fact of governing in your opinion and if elected what do you do anything to combat these types of attacks\nYou know carry it is disappointed to see how Washington dysfunction you know I certainly don't\nFollow the same path that the president does on how I legislate\nOr how I deal with people but at the same time my opponent has made comments that are pretty disturbing as well she said that anybody who voted for the president was part of an ugly stew of racist okay\nShe said that when Republicans wanted to try to fix health care that we wanted blood money from the American people she's you know called to abolish ice and you know what when you have rhetoric that undercuts law enforcement you wind up having people like a Cambridge supporter of hers who put a five hundred dollar bounty if somebody would shoot\nSomebody from ice okay that's how low things have gotten I Want to be a different voice I have not\nEnact acted like that up on ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com a no ... no ...
