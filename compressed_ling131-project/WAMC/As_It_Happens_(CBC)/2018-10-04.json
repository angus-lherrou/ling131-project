perspective\nIt reveals that Mr Trump received four hundred and Thirteen million US dollars from his father's real estate empire\nMost of it because he helped his family dodge taxes [noise]\nTwo years ago reporters Suzanne Craig Canadian was mailed Mr Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax returns she told us he had possibly avoid paying federal taxes for Eighteen years but now the times is reporting that Mr Trump participated in outright fraud\nWe reached Suzanne Craig in New York City\nSo then you put out a tweet at what you up to last night as you waited for this story to be printed in today's paper what did you do\nAfter a after we were finished at work I went out to a depressed New York times press plant in Queens and I watch the uh the story that we wrote roll off the process\nSo we last time we spoke a couple of years ago you received a brown paper ... in which you had a part of Donald Trump's Nineteen Ninety five tax return and from that you were able to extrapolate a lot of information but since then\nYou have found other streams of documents to describe what you would not put in the past two years what you have an earth since then\nSure we continue to look at 'em Donald Trump talks is after the story that we rode in two thousand and sixteen or we got three pages of his tax returns right before election day\nUm and we just continue to push on his find out says part of that we examine tens of thousands of public documents and we also got access to thousands and thousands of confidential documents for Trump's real estate empire\nYou tend to questions to Donald Trump his lawyer Charles Harder responded that should the times state or implied that President Trump participated in fraud or tax evasion or any of the crime it will expose you to my ability and damages for defamation so I Know the language is careful here and is in the article how would you characterize\nThe charges you're putting out here concerning Donald Trump is family and the families empire\nWell we found in terms of the the the the wrong doing we found several instances based on the documents that we looked up where Donald Trump participated in fraudulent talk ski [noise]\nIt's getting into some examples of if you would not just say for instance can we talk about what happened when they do it was huge numbers of loans that Donald Trump received from his father had grown to into the millions of dollars how did he covered for those\nDonald Trump is sort of long claimed as part of of this this narrative that his credit for\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nWho made it to the president he's like a self made billionaire and and we found not only did we we uncovered in the documents not only at least sixty one million dollars in loans that are that Trump extended to Donald Trump and the cases many of them were repaid we also found that Donald Trump received over\n... lifetime more than ... and beyond also has an inheritance more than four hundred million dollars from his father\nSaid temping is his father and there's one instance you give that the fat trap at one point and spent fifty million dollars to buy a stake in at ... palace how how did he then and then sold it back to his son can you describe that\nSure I think spent Fifteen million it would be a generous description of it he Donald Trump owed um his father Fifteen million dollars in that that debt I'm instead of being a you know written off\nWas in fact he used it to invest in the Trump power so he turned the debt into an investment in Trump powerless and then it was written down to almost nothing\nYou mentioned companies the old county building supply maintenance can you tell us what that was\nSure that was one of the most intriguing a fraud that we found it was probably the most kind of ones with the bright lights around it is Fred Trump was getting older and to his eighties\nHe he'd only not only you know huge number of buildings and the New York area worth hundreds of millions of dollars but he was also sitting on a huge amount of cash and Donald Trump ... siblings realized that\nAt some point he was going to die and not money was going to be subject to a fifty five percent inheritance talk so with the Trump got kids that it's it's pretty incredible for years for Trump would you know for his buildings he would buy everything from bridges and so and then one day\nA company called ... county was created and suddenly all county started doing all the buying for Trump's empire they would pay three hundred dollars for new fridge is but then they would create a separate receipt and they would mark it up anywhere from twenty to fifty percent and send it up to Fred and the difference on not was pocketed by all county which\nWas controlled by Donald Trump and his siblings it mounted allowed them to drain huge amounts millions of dollars in cash from their fathers empire so that it would not be subject to the death tax\nJust finally the kind of an overarching a theme of this this investigation is that\nThat Donald Trump and it is presented is understood to have been a self made man isn't ... why does it matter what is that in what way does it fit into the story about tried as to how Donald Trump benefited profited from that in the solid G\nWell he's he's benefitted greatly over the years from now if this law that has been repeated over and over and over and\nI guess just the mist making of him that's been wrong and it's a spectacular call and it was interesting as we were going through the reporting early on in the Nineteen seventies right out you know when he graduates he goes to work for his father he does an interview with the New York times and he goes around and he he talks about this job that's his and\nAnd this building that says and he's driving around in a car and he's you know showing this reporter all this stuff and it was incredible every\nEvery building he showed the reporter was his father's even though he claimed it was his own as his life went on he then started to diminish his father's achievements you know he would say only about a million dollar loan my father was a great building but it was in Brooklyn and queens and then when it came time in two thousand and four or five years after ...
