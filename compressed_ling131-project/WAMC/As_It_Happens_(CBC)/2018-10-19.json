afford to buy your stuff and none of existing policies that the government send about around are good enough to combat ongoing automation and globalization effective think government policies in those regards mostly failed\nTo prevent this this reduction in fortunes for most of society\nThat you write in your lab that it said the issue that you see is that there is this huge me growing sector of our our workforce who are in low income jobs that day you described it five times as many people\nSince Nineteen Ninety seven having minimum wage jobs but here's the question then is that if your your belief is that if people have more\nDisposable income when it's all boats will float higher I mean that this will be good for business\nWhy don't businesses and that's why they why are they supporting an increase in minimum wage why aren't you pay your workers more the way you know we we we know that the old Ford motors see me was that if you pay people a higher wage they'll buy your product so why should the government ... why don't you do it\nWell a lot of us are in fact on the ... the question came up in some of the some of the seals I spoke to the queen spark\nWere for increasing minimum wage I I'm One of them some of them ... ... ... it would be better but let's look at the advantages of a basic income over a minimum wage and not seeing that we should not increase minimum wage I think we should\nBut the ... will be more universal so people caregivers are entrepreneurs people doing community service work people during the economy work what all benefit from that versus minimum wage which only applies to a narrow sector of employment\nSo what's going on with the economy as though it's not that robots will come to take your job or what what is not like what happened to my dad an uncle who lost their jobs in Ontario manufacturing sector\nToday so today what's happening is that a lot of people just aren't being hired from the beginning\nWhich means which means there's not enough local demand is not enough local high paying work and all the experts I mentioned looking at the future of automation are saying that's going to get a lot worse\nOr so I think we need to look at ... as an economic issue not a social assistance issue it's a way to grow the economy create jobs make low paying work actually work for everyone so they can compete on a global level and that can actually find find work that suits best suits them\nThis is kind of person I was like you in your own family thinking as when you when you write this letter\nYeah I mean I I have a quite a few stories intersect of me I mean I grew up in a household that had\nA hot domestic violence I Wish my mom has the means to leave and I think if she had to be I think maybe she would we actually see that in in the seventies the base can come in the U.S almost passed under Richard Nixon\nIt it passed in the house the Nixon was going to sign it into law except it some of the experiments running at the time in the U.S and Canada show to an end in in significant increase in the divorce rate\nAmong married couples who have basic income because women were able to leave abusive households then frankly I think that's a good thing we also see not happened in the trials\nIn Africa and Kenya right now a report of a greater marital harmony or we we seen the trials in India for instance women in the villages are taking off their head pieces like dressing more liberally and telling that the researchers that The Elders and the village can't control them any more\nSo when I think they can come as deeply emancipated for women but for everyone because imagine if anyone imagine if you as the listener\nKnew that you would never starve you have this this money coming in and there's no shame or on the

the murder the butchery of ... I'm In the Saudi ... in\nIn a ... if you are prime minister how would you respond or would you cancel any arms deals we have with Saudi Arabia\nWell you know I have to uh I have to be conscious of the fact that I don't have the same levels and briefings that the liberals have in the primary strategies aware of much more to the story than I Am to security and intelligence briefings and things like that\nI Believe though that this incident should be a wakeup call a a boat or the government in Saudi Arabia at about it's it's um [noise]\nUh it's the role it's playing in the world\nI'm I've been reading a lot in this recently and uh it is very disturbing when you look at what the Saudi Government has has has done in this case the the cover up to follow that\nAh that this is alarming everyone should be concerned about this it that the idea that have happened to you know in another country not not in Canada not to a Kenyan\nThat ... the Saudi Government plays a very significant role in geopolitics uh there are a lot of our concerns about the the sanctioning of of a terrorist groups and and and where the money follows a lot of that has come through\nA new entities within within that country and I think this we all need to get together as as as western democracies liberal democracy I should say western because the fact structures all around the world for freedom loving nation shut

out tall hairy creature that bore a striking resemblance to poke through the BLM character from the long running TV oh children's program Pocono door\nBut it was four twenty on legalization day in Canada so the creature was not poker room at all it was going through the creation of mark Scott who used to play poker roulette special promotional events we reached Scott in Toronto\nNot for those who didn't get a chance to see him letters took a look like\nWell ... would be a play on the iconic poker room which I created a parody of and is a character who will talk about\nResponsible drug use now that Canada has legalized candidates for recreational use there can be more discussion about responsible altered states\nHigh and so ... for getting to the description Doug looks like poker for people who have not seen poker who don't have kids what does poker look like\nWell poker room is a poker dotted kangaroo from a show called oak it outdoor\nVery popular with everyone who has kids

they're affiliated agencies and I got to meet the queen as poker rue I'm Colin Powell came to bring a program called America's Promise with a little red wagon as their symbol\nAnd um ... when he had his twenty fifth anniversary Saturday Night at the movies I I got to be part of that\nThough that now we never got to hear your voice is really odd hearing it now\nWell yes because poker room or in most of the time until Nineteen Ninety six when he came out of the land talking was a sort of the nation when I was told to talk I was given the instructions to be kind of like Julia Child and the frog\nWell look I think there's three great shipyards in Canada that are all involved in one way or another building the next generation ship for the navy and the coast guard\nDecisions with respect to trying to cancel or change one of those ships which the Trudeau government did do and that's quite public that deserves a fair I'm an open transparent release of documents because uh charges brought against a very fine Canadian Mr Norman\nThe second highest ranking officer in the military has been charged in relation to it so he deserves that trend that transcript I don't know what's in it I was not at the cabinet table for the liberal cabinet I was in the conservative I think all of it should be released and Canadians can see what was discussed on on all counts\nAnd with the idea and he had ... device admiral Norman with it in criminal breach of trust for allegedly seeking to keep the day the contact on of course you have your colleagues in jest these ... based on what\nI'm I have learned through the media that there were investigations into leaks of cabinet secrets surrounding the who Trudeau cabinet and their decisions and that apparently some cabinet documents were leaked but charges were not brought for breach of trust against some other civil servants it appears that\nThere was a targeted campaign against admiral Norman he is the one facing trial no one else is even though the investigation revealed there were several leaks around liberal decisions on on ship building\nHe deserves as any Canadian would do a full answer in defense writes both under section seven and eleven of the charter it you know the the Trudeau government\nUh talks a lot of a sunny ways and transparency they have the ability to ensure that all documents released we don't care what send them\nThat will be determined by a court so that he can get a fair hearing\nAnd they know the story was originally published by CBC News journalist at that time was James had more who went to

involving a Mr Bryson Mr Trudeau other members of the cabinet with respect to this contract where they advancing concerns that they heard from interested parties all of this deserves transparency I think ah\nWhen someone's reputation and literally there's liberty is on the line we should air in favor of making sure his charter rights are respected\nVice admiral Norman is represented by Murray hadn't and very very good defense lawyer with the patients for success or is it possible that this political interference doing is just a pie in the defense lawyer trying to create down in the ... case against declined\nThere's no question he has very capable council and in fact Mr Goodell said today in the house that our system works when things are left in the hands of defense counsel the trouble is the liberal governments are tying the hands of defense counsel\nBy not providing documents that are central to the case if the trust that was breached in this case is the trust and confidence around decisions a cabinet sorry you have to\nRelease those documents to see if indeed trust or minutes or cabinet memos were leaked the government can't have it both ways they basically ran a very respected senior officer out of the military on a rail I respect the fact he's standing up\nFor his reputation he wants to return to duty if the liberals are prepared to release these documents they should ensure that the charges were dropped because\nIt's a farce I Will be there we will be following this story and this new tool thank you\nThank you very much or no deal is a
