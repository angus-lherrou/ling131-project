election it became clear that a lot of divisive misleading and flat out false information was coming from Facebook\nIn fact a study earlier this year said Facebook was responsible for spreading more false news than any other online platform and once the bad information was out there fact checking couldn't do much to reverse its impact\nAfter the twenty sixteen election Facebook partnered with some news organizations to try to get misinformation before it spread something that two years later still feels like an uphill battle\nAndrew ... is the editor at politifact one of the outlets working with Facebook she said fact checkers get access to a special selection of potentially false information\nWe see what's essentially the worst news speed you've ever seen it's typically post from websites or other sources that users have flagged\nFacebook puts things on this feed for fact checkers that imitate\nReal news so there's some things that we don't see in the feed we don't see politicians statements we don't see ads we just see content that people have marked as potentially fall and it tends to be news sites that you've never heard of that are not super common\nDo you wish you didn't have to do this on Facebook Like is it I guess is it even worth it to try to do this on Facebook as their potential for it to get better\nOne of the big criticisms of Facebook is that they haven't shared enough data especially with academic researchers but also to some extent with fact checkers so it's really hard for me to say if things are getting better or worse\nI Can't say that subjectively it does feel like there are fewer outrageous posts being shared as real news on the platform\nSo I Am an optimist and I do think that if we have robust fact checking on a platform that the quality of information on that platform will improve\nWhat do you think happened\nStreaming support for WAMC come from ... woods to warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's

how to detect false information and photos and we're just going to bring this into our machine learning\nWell I think that's a great outcome than we can move on to other types of fact checking\nBut overall I feel like this is a problem to be managed rather than stalls\nIf you look at history if you look at other technologies such as the printing press there's always been problems with misinformation and the need for people to find ways to mark sources as\nCredible and authoritative so I don't see the problem that's on Facebook is going away it can get better but it's not going to
