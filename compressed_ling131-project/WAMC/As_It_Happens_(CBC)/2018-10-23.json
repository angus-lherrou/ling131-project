privately owned that is a very very high a percentage and so we're gonna have to move to more housing that is owned and operated by the nonprofit sector\nThat housing will probably look more or less the same but the way we run it will be very different it won't be based on on a you know making profit that means we can offer lower rent and then those buildings still make revenue so then we can use that extra revenue to put it into social housing which would be kind of welfare rate housing\nWhich be also desperately need because the number of homeless center city has doubled since two thousand

starting to feel units that were just purely being speculated upon really empty condos essentially are they are starting to fill up now is as the owners try to ah\nYou know avoid the tax but we want to accelerate this as well and actually we're finding now that some speculators are selling their condos to folks that want to live in them so the the taxes are proving effective and tripling it will

requests from the city\nSo I think I've said that I Would strike an emergency task force with a health care professionals in the first line responders to give us immediate steps that we can take\nAnd then it's my job to help go and get that implemented so that would be to for example talk to the federal government about getting specific exemptions from the criminal code to talk to the provincial

you\nKnow in the course of the me too movement which is just a bit over a year old now we've seen many men apologize after being public ... and for you what was it like having this experience of someone apologizing without having been named her shamed or in some ways sort of forced into it\nYeah so so there are two things about his apology one was um\n... and this really did hit me the fact that he did not have to do this I mean he could have and I wrote this in the ... the follow up piece that I that I wrote he could have read the piece recognized himself and thought I Wonder what's for

to reach out to you and apologize and he just said I'm Sorry\nYeah well and obviously he there was a level of trust with you and for him to be able to do that on some level I mean one of the things that struck me um in in reading your column about this since you don't say whether or not you accepted his apology\nThat the the the last line in in in your column and when you receive you're talking about receiving the apology and you're you're right and that is something I can guarantee I won't forget\n'em why did you choose not to let us know when and of course I'm curious do you accept his apology\nYeah so I I Do accept that I Do accept it and I think that's a big\nWay forward in terms of the me too movement I don't think all women need to\nNeed to let on and off the hook for their actions and\nI I don't believe that however I think there is a lot of there's a lot of power that women have in freeing men who are able to come to the point that this man was able to come to which is

just so many things can affect it outside of your control and especially being my first one I I just it was very very unknown to me\nWhy did you want to go from running shorter distances to running the marathon\nI think it's a natural transition for a lot of a distance athlete's foot myself running the five ... on the track\nBut for me I had a very serious surgery on my left ankle in middle of twenty sixteen and um I actually had some difficulty doing track where it goes from that point on just handling the corners of track\nAnd so it was just sort of a natural fit that I could do a little

now\nIn that recovery me as you mentioned serious injury um do you run for a long period of time were you concerned that there was a point that maybe you wouldn't be able to run at all\nI don't think
