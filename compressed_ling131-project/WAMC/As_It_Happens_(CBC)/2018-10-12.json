you'll be able to get around that time was rescued migrants you say the idea is to bring them to put to allow them to get out and to make the refugee claim why he's confident that will happen\nOkay maybe I'm not confident that will happen I mean I think that that's the intention of course of the mission if it weren't going to happen and the Italian government were to block it illegally that would be unimportant act to protest so I guess one have to plan for all such eventuality is\nSo is this launches this ship is just as much a political statement at political action as it is a rescue mission\nI think it it first and foremost a humanitarian effort but I think it also has a\nPedagogical value as much as as political I mean I think it's important for people to recognize what the governments are doing regarding migrate rescue what governments like Italy is are blocking\nOutside of the Pentagon trouble value in another sense you know I'm In the U.S and here\nThere is a great feeling of you know not only disillusionment but powerlessness interface with not only right wing governments\nRacist policies but also a feeling of even though it's probably not completely true right wing majorities favoring them I think the demonstrating that even in such situations that we can do something seems to me a really important public backed a kind of demonstration\nWe certainly know there are many Italians who ... who wants to help and we've covered the stories and spoken the some of those people and but it's the government has the support that's doing this and so are you looking for a confrontation the Italian government over this\nIs certainly not the intention of the project to seek a confrontation\nBut one would be naive not to prepare for such possibility you know so there is a legal team standing by there are the plants what to do so I don't think that seeking confrontation with the government or police as really\nSeem to me like a useful tactic but once you shrink from it either I think that we still have to stand up for what we fix right\nAway but the people who beyond that but what about those migrants to possibly by hundreds will be on a boat or you or are they are they do become pawns in it and then\nNaturally not and that's why I said before that I think the the obvious and first purpose was such a mission is humanitarian aid if their process and applying for asylum in Italy or elsewhere in Europe\nOr delayed or difficult that would be unfortunate it certainly do a much better than being returned to Libya which is deemed by international agency was not a safe port\n... will be watching you progress and watching how the ship does I appreciate you being with us thank you\nThanks for much by\nMichael hardest part of an activist group

you've never heard of ... worked for years before they get they often fail on their first try and on the second and third no twenty three one expert you post the masters similarly exam this fall of lost their designation\nThe limits given by the court of masters of millions a group of strips the titles because it discovered someone leaked information about the one on the tasting exam the court has a little else the cheating scandal [noise]\nCourtney she was always a wine journalist who worked as a civilian some of New York's top restaurants we reached her in New York\nCourtney first of all what does it mean to ... to get this title of master Somalia\nIt's probably the most lauded achievement that you could have in the wind world it's certainly not necessary for our summer yet but the people who become ... has worked for years and years to achieve this goal\nAnd then to lose if the people you have been talking with a loss as what what did they say do you\nI mean it's really devastating I have to say everyone I've spoken to just still in a lot of shock um and they're really surprised because something like this has never happened before and especially considering that twenty three of the twenty four\nMaster some way to pass this year had work to pass this tasting portion it's usually the most difficult\nPiece of the ... to pass so it's really just been devastating not only for them but for the entire flight ...\nAnd the exam is notoriously rigorous all three parts of it which is I guess or is a knowledge based part there is a practical part and then there is the most difficult part which is that the tasting\nPortion of the exam just described for people what it entails [noise] yeah\nAbsolutely and that's just only exam itself is the highest of four levels that you can achieve within the quarter master ... so you have to pass your introductory certified and advanced exam which can take several years to pack\nSo by the time that you get to her master's only exam first you have to pass theory on a separate gay and then on a later date you have both a practical exam a service exam which also includes questions that you may be given on the floor as ... as well as the tasting exam which is\nSix lines that you must blind taste in twenty five\nTwenty five minutes six wines you're blindfolded or you're you're you're you can't see what you're doing and you have to identify what\n[noise] so you're not blindfolded you can see the winds in front of you it's usually three white and three red\nBut you must go through each of the wind systematically assess the site the aromas and the power of the line and then based on what you're tasting you must come to a conclusion on where the wind is from what the great variety is an ... vintage the wine is from as well\nWhen you consider the they say that most people blindfold who can't tell the difference between white wine in red wine is really extraordinary what they have to know\nYeah absolutely\nAnd so this part of the exam this is the part that has been called into question what exactly happened\n[noise] so we really don't know the court of master suddenly it's America's has not released too much information on what the physically happens all we've been told is that a current master ...\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid no open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nSo we don't know if that was before during or after the exam because the candidates are never told\nWhat the winds are even after the exam we don't know if they reveal the identity that the wind if they just gave them some clues as to what might be on the exam we really don't know and they have that release any additional information about that\nBut he canceled the exam results of the taste portion or the whole exam\nJust the tasting portion and they have a invalidate\nThe results for everybody so that means is that everyone who kept the tasting portion of the exam whether they pass or fail now has the opportunity to reset the exam\nWhat did the people who did the exam what did they go through to get to the point where they were doing this test\nI mean it is a huge time and financial investment to study for the masters on my example particularly the tasting portion of the exam because you have to taste a lot of wind in order to be able\nTo pass this exam I Know that in the film the sound found that came out a few years ago some estimated that they spent as much as twenty thousand dollars\nOn wind to taste throughout the year before their exam\nAnd the person who is suspected of having given this confidential information to those taking the tests ... whatever he or she went through to get there this is a huge risk lead to lose a lot that's been last year I Would imagine\nAbsolutely one I've spoken to other master some ways for the piece that I wrote in seven fifty daily they really\nWere boggled at why somebody would want to cheat the system because it is such a high honor why would they then want to undercut the name by giving someone out information that allows them to cheat the exam\nYou know when we're trying to get someone to talk to us about this uh people refuse to do an interview ... a Sunday does in we're talking with you agreed does that surprise you that so many people don't want to even discuss this [noise]\nIt doesn't surprise me that those who had gained the title of master ... and now we're having taken away from them it doesn't surprise me that they don't want to talk at at this point because I think for many the emotions are still raw and they also so badly want to keep this title\nAre Landrieu stolen or resources been stolen the they created the divisions against a first\nNations so people don't forget you know we know the history and the and the history of this relationship is not a good picture\nTo look at today and it's even worse after this decision\nExplain a bit more of this because it seems that the court is saying is that because of the divisions powers listening Canadian system that the court cannot interfere with legislation that's not passed at this idea that the federal government must consult with first nations drafting laws\nThey're saying that while you can take the federal government to court after it's passed a law and say that that's unconstitutional and it's a violation of treaty rights\nBut the courts can't into the er during the legislative process is that what they're saying\nIs that's what they're saying but I I totally disagree with that I totally disagree because one is the last time any legislation has been overturned impact inherent rights of our people never\nAnd you know it's a lot of lip service that they do a very good at it when the liberal government came into power prime minister Justin Trudeau said the most important relationship that he wants to have is with the first nations well that's nothing but left the service and B. S. does the that the liberal government has a give\nUs a nothing but lip service to the elections coming true they're going to come back on ah trying to get support from a first nations chances are first nations are are going to get stronger and get together and and not support a liberal government\nAnd the the relationship right now is a it's a it's damage or is it through parable well described it out of work to be done on on on a part of a the federal government who are aversion power\nWhat is it you want them to do and and this is not just in this case but they say in the development of was below the poverty level in the ... what are you trying to stop them from developing and or or what what level do you want to see an end in an intervention\nWe want to be part of a of this uh the development we want to be part sort of it's manageable\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and

minister a\nSheet of cops department trying to pick up plans we reach out and then we won the Supreme Court so you think that this one should have been easier to make for for she'll be in court\nSo uh I feel that the Supreme Court judges or didn't want to make that decision based on whether they get a backlash from the from the rest of Canada and the federal government doesn't matter which which are parties in power\nThey've always kept the the general public in a dark they don't let him know that they're part of the treaty and that uh they're benefiting more from the tree you didn't know the frustrations are\nAsked at the beginning when he goes from here I've seen that in the Supreme Court ruling on this that national chief pay down guard is saying that where it takes you is into the courts over and over again that this is just going to be lots of court cases lots of lawyers lots in consultations this is this is the teacher\nWell let's just put it this way\nJust wait and see what happens because uh I don't think we we have any faith any court system in in this country anymore and uh you know things are going to change and a half in really a don't speak for the nation's I'm very saddened at the national chief\nWould be worked closely with a I not to try to push a there are enough to gender to basically erode our treaty rich so uh I I have no uh I have no faith in the in
