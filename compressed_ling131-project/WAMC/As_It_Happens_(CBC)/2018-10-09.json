conduit in run lines across federal lands requires a whole other set of\nRegulations and so if you think about how we deployed electricity a hundred years ago you know we recognize that it wasn't profitable for for profit companies to run the lines out twenty miles out one form or and so that's where I got through co ops and I do think that it's a sticking point right now and trying to figure

have made the relationship between growth technology and climate change focus of their work their names are William North house and Paul Romer we reach Mr Romer in New York\nTo visit Romer congratulations thanks\nSo much about how you found out\nA I heard the phone rang twice this morning just before six and I thought it was a spam call so I didn't even bother to uh uh trying to answer\nBut I couldn't get back to sleep I started thinking well it's unusual to get spam at that time a morning so I thought maybe it was one of my kids and then I looked and saw that it was from Sweden\nAnd I thought oh I better I better give them a call back\nAnd how exciting it to get that news\nOn to that he repeated that um Saudi Arabia sets a how shall be left up his own free will um the consulate on Tuesday Afternoon I I asked him if they had any um video evidence of that because there are security cameras ... so that\nHe said those cameras are showing live stream and they don't have a recording\nThey might even further declines that didn't they they took you for two or six floors of this building in order to prove to you that the journalists wasn't there\nThat's right they did a they were very keen to back up what they were saying at the time that was a Pulitzer rumors that that he was\nA abducted will being held in the concept so uh from that point you get the purpose of this was to you know to to to make that case that he wasn't there so we did have a have a tour of the building as you say it's it's it's a pretty large building from the outside it looks like a regular that townhouse if you'd like it's a maybe\nA two or three stories but it goes there are two three floors subterranean posed as well\nSo we had a tour of the consulate from the the absolute basement weather's a prayer room where this sort of filing storage rooms\nI'm On the other five floors that include a ... a visa count to include a offices for officials with dealing with Saudi of fads you know Saudi nationals who are in Turkey over the turkey\nOr the counsel's office himself um on on the other offices so we did have an extensive ... um the comfortable going round who's I think ... it's just sort of show look you know nothing to hide here\nUm but obviously we are a I'm a journalist I wasn't conducting a forensic such um I couldn't you know at the end of that to say\nYou know there's there's nothing to be seen hit but but it was a very unusual move they said they never done this before I'm a history of the concepts from that perspective it was in ... I'm trying to go a long way to discount any accusations that she ... she was actually being held up to ...\nBizarre scene that must have been doing going around looking opening cupboards no nothing ... he's not here is not under the table he's at the back room I mean that's that is really strained [laughter]\nIt's one of the more unusual assignments I've done setting the the thing about Mr ... them saying that he is now here we don't have any hair he's not in Saudi Arabia and that doesn't exactly say that they didn't do something to him does it\nKnow that that was simply somebody to say he wasn't a he wasn't Afrikaans that on Saturday afternoon when when we visited and that there were no obvious immediate signs of of anything untoward them\nThere are a lot of political tensions between Saudi Arabia and turkey so it does that factor into your your your questioning of the Turkish authorities and what they say happened to Mr ...\nIt's definitely the pay check 'em as you say that the relations and not a not great for a number of reasons a president I Would want the government itself is a is poverty has its roots in Islamic Islamic politics took heat supported a government in Egypt that was a Muslim Brotherhood\nGovernment in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen or the Muslim Brotherhood is that the movement which the Saudis have the fat as a as a terrorist organization\nSo um they're a big political differences between turkey and Saudi Arabia president Edwin has has not you know go on a one hundred percent on sort of attack mode criticism mode of Saudi Arabia\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nVery important country and the beach and it's an economic power\nUm it's no more important country for a for Muslims it's time to come to the science\nSo it will be a very major escalation if if he came out officially publicly an openly and made it very direct accusation against the king of Saudi Arabia um that it had deliberately killed a citizen in in stumble\n...

Ontario\n... vodka made from the college now it tastes like\nA it's a start well my opinion is fantastic it's a much of a standard fog but\nWith absolutely no burned and the sweet smell and the a terribly finish leaving no burn\nA few big box of college date but a vodka elephant often has said it out for tone sort of place to it which many people do like a ... when you drink it burns going down but ours has done to that it's a very smooth exit\nAcids don't take nail polish remover right big you were going to say is quite sibling delicately so what does it look like does it look like milk\nOh no it's completely clear just like a like if I could read the Philip to Ninety four percent alcohol purity dilute it with water to Britain it to forty percent off so you could mix it with all your favorite cocktails but what people are telling us is that it's good to sit on its own which is pretty rare and about\nIt and it just made this was a regular milk or or what part of milk is using to make the vodka\nBut we're using a call ... ... so what happens is you know comes into the little post suffer from all the harms our keeps were part\nOf the largest protests are about an hour South Florida was the thoughts are taken off they fighter ice cream and then there was a skim milk\nAnd what they do to make it cheaper to ship the teams could not concentrate them by taking out the water and when they do that they also take out the lactose minerals and vitamins\nAnd that liquid is called no problem yet and what's interesting is right now they have very little use for all the vast majority of it stopped and that's what we're turning into all\nThis ... this is their the farmers just get rid of it it's just like this is a waste product tens of knock the milk and cheese and in fact her production\nStuff right I I don't like to call it a wave but it's something lifting weights that right now but uh but no sugar all the ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThe safety is full of this because like closest harmful to the environment so it's an environmental problem it's a financial problem because if it costs to dispose of it and also don't want that wants to see a good portion of what comes out of the cat waste how do you turn it into alcohol\nAll that for a we work with the University of Ottawa with a professor who live there in the biology department to find a ... that can prevent a ... most useful eat it but you know new Steve how are you will consume a lot to do some parties\nTo instill in big vats like that like any other alcohol\nThat's right well it comes in we actually gonna milk truck that pulls up here\nAre they pump it into our from intern so we have a large and still from after\nWe filled up with ... or we pitch in our used they get to work with take about three or four days to convert the toes into alcohol then we put into our students when we were five the alcohol right up to Ninety four percent\nAnd then uh we talk about with water to make about ...\nIf someone were lactose intolerant ... drinks is\nOh that's a great question no not at all so be useful cleave the lock those flew into their basic sugars and the equal sugar is absolutely no lactose is the final product\nAnd is it something you have to refrigerate\nI don't know at a at the end of it it sounds like the only difference what's being made from a from though\nAnd not there is ... I'm I'm variations like it's like ... guys let's see it's new there yet [laughter] nail polish remover and and and do you drink ... mix it with something that's what's what what do you what are your recipes at this point\nWell you can make said and we found that it mixes are obviously very well with milk so we've been mixed foreign are also making premature so I think of a bally's part of one hundred percent\nBut there is something we're working hard and and but also for sipping strength feedback is people like it just uh on ice so ah it's very versatile\nThey make a wet Russian I presume a very white Russian yeah [laughter]\nOf course you're talking about the area because then you trade agreement with the United states and what that means to dairy farmers they're quite upset about that is ... is something that dairy farmers ... how do you think that that affects the dairy industry\nWell like for example right now on the ... is the third largest purchaser of voluntary are great at right now the alcohol in the ... an ounce purchased from there so\nDiners of your your son's murder and just so angry with you so much to the ... no one pointed that was just extraordinary\n... was ... or ... and how did you deal with that at the time\nAh to tell you the truth uh I think God was still pretty much living on adrenalin and I'm a tutor sat in a new song I felt like I had nothing left to lose a so I'm not normally is maybe a braver foolhardy\n[laughter] as I was as far as exposing myself to nurture possible dangers back then\nYou call yourself you said I'm I'm and then nothing left to lose club I think you said in our interview\nRight right well there were a lot of us are back in the day I remember um when there were a lot of people who have lost children in the war and\nUh that's what we call ourselves\nBut do you came to this point is it a forgiving housing collie ... not immediately this is something that was a process it took some months about half a year and you're describing that to us when we spoke team in two thousand and six I just wanted to play a bit of what you said at that time\nAfter time never once asked for revenge against it that much of a quite a while to work\nOne day I catalogue of course you're immaculate universe\nThat vision for a lot of Catholic I'm not a Christian [noise] very much of anything\nElse\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nWell I think one of the biggest things that it taught me was that to forgive someone is not to condone what they did I certainly don't condone what what Cirque our dead\nBut it's basically a A R R it says in her not to have a noted is process um the sister sister she ... her taught that corset ... said\nA forgiveness is slight quitting cigarettes sometimes you have to do it over and over again\nSo it's you know it's uh it it it is a process and uh\nShe was just so great and presenting things in such a way that anybody could could accept them and explaining the nuances of the differences between condoning and forgiving and and other things that people\nOften confused and ultimately\nForgiveness isn't for the person being forgiven as for the person to just during the forgiving and it changed my outlook on life in general\nOr my relations with people especially people close to me and ah you know it's it's still a tremendous factor in my life\nIt fair to say that that could change the course of your life\nIt certainly did and it's very fair to say\nAnd Peter I I think it's safe to say that to interview Michael's words changed your life didn't [noise]\nUh yeah they did I I just got to my son just listening to do it again and um I I mean this is funny just listening to it in today's times uh twelve years later and and realizing that that message is still more important than ever hum and at the time I was listening to Michael and as I was listening to this interview I [noise]\nI just wasn't expecting the way that it was going to unfold and the reaction that he was describing and as you know what I found out later in the interview that people call them a coward and shot at him I said\nI said hang on [laughter] you know the the the message that this man is saying is that the most courageous brave choice I've ever heard somebody ever make and it felt like\nThe antidote to this escalating hatred that was was happening in the world and just listening to it again today I'm just like it's still the answer [laughter] it still remains the answer it still remains more important than ever so he struck\nBy how do you remember the details the situation in which you listen to to Michael in this interview\nYeah I was I was driving along in my car and and a Canadian musician spent a lot of time driving across Canada a lot of time the Senate CBC and and I would always listen to as it happens and\nAnd you know it's just one of those things is on and you're listening to it and you're taking it in but it's one of those interviews that I just kinda zeroed in on as I clued into what was being said and and to me the part that I was very moved you know just by Michael's reaction in of itself I was very unexpected reaction\nBut what really kind of jolted me into action was was the fact that you know like I said the people shot at him and and and called them a coward and just put him through\nEven more held and then I ... I don't have a son I don't know what it's like to lose one let alone under the circumstances that Michael last Nick I'm so when I found out that that people were doing that to him I just said\nThat to me is just just unconscionable and I need to do something about that and and I need to somehow amplifies message and and yeah the you know the context of it was\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHe um you know mission accomplished that kind of lingo and you know they were using a I mean I I I I don't want to speak for Mike on this but they were using Nick can the murder of ... or ... as as a reason to justify what they were doing revenge yeah\n... and the lyrics of your son I'm just going to read the the course and then we're going to hear it later on some people know they're not going to miss that\nSo I guess I'm going to have to try forgiveness because men you know that's all that I've got left my boy did not deserve this but neither do the rest I guess in going to have to try forgiveness ... how did those words continue\nThose words came to me right away [laughter] um I think I pulled over and wrote down those words and then as is often the case for me was with writing I I kinda have the initial thing and then I knew I needed to be with that because sometimes the the sort of surface reaction is is not deep enough and I I immediately just\nCared about it so deeply and I and I knew that I was going to be singing in Michael's voice so I wanted to\nDo it properly um it wasn't just about channeling my own feelings about it I really want it to amplify his voice that was the goal so I wrote those words down and then I actually ended up seeking out to a copy of the interview that you guys had done and I I transcribed it\nI'm just so I could kind of practice putting words together in the way that Michael put words together and really then just kind of work from there and very carefully put it together\n... Michael ... when you first heard this on what was your reaction\nOf ours are reserved for calm ... territory overcome that um\nIn light of all the negative reactions though I had that someone would have such an understanding of what our men and bishops kind and serve a generation or\nIn this respect just over ... still does every time I ...\nThe two of you became friends didn't you read the door [noise] what was the friendship based on what is it just this moment you didn't do did you find it to the to a deep replaced\nLute who was a Knicks Knicks best friend organized or a concert and they created a scholarship and Nick's name they called it ... [laughter] and they are invited me down to come perform at concerts and so I went down to west Chester Pennsylvania\nAnd I I stayed in the guest room it leaks house where he told me that Nick would have spent much time and um [noise]\nAnd then we did this concert and I got to meet Michael we went for a coffee together in the afternoon and then I I play this concert and uh I stood on stage and in my view or next friends and family and teachers and Michael and um [noise]\nAnd I got to play the song and um I my whole body shaking just thinking about that moment and and how touched I felt to be able to do that in and contribute in that way and then several years in a row I went down and did that and\nAnd then Michael and I were also invited to give a symposium on forgiveness at a at a college in Philadelphia in two thousand twelve and we've got to spend even more time together then and I remember going for a long walk together in a park and just just so enjoying our time together but it's uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu states\nAh yeah yeah I'm In my mid thirties so um I I guess ... neck worried about is that right Michael Vick with the forty okay so pretty close five years younger yeah\n[noise] I'm sticking the singer songwriter Peter ... who wrote a song called forgiveness and inspired by an interview on as it happens with Michael Byrd", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Albany", "day": "09"}
