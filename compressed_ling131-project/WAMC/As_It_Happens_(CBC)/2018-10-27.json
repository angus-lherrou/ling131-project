W. dot com has more information\nApple CEO Tim Cook threw down about privacy in the tech industry or what he called the data industrial complex he called for the United states to adopt a comprehensive digital privacy regulations\nApple has stress privacy is a selling point over the past couple of years but this was a big broadside at a couple of the other biggest tech firms in the world namely Facebook and Google\nAnd it's worth noting that it's easy for Apple to privacy when the option it's offering is it closed ecosystem where the company controls every aspect of the technology\nLet's dig into this and quality assurance the friday segment where we take a deeper look at a big tech story Tony Robbins attacked policy reporter at the Washington Post he covered cooks remarks I think\nTim Cook is pretty frustrated with Silicon Valley he's certainly not the only one these days\nFor the company though I was able to do this because its business model is so much different than a company like Facebook and Google\nThose two companies rely on collecting data about you and turning that data into insights that can then be sold to advertisers that's how they monetize things with apple it's different we're talking about the sale of iPhones and iPads and knocked the pros so I you know Apple CEO Tim Cook has a bit more of a runway to talk about these things and his peers\nWhat did you think about these comments afterward by Facebook's former chief security officer Alex Day most he said Tim Cook is being a little hypocritical because the company accommodates Chinese censorship and essentially saying you know nobody's clean when they're making billions of dollars off of selling technology\nDads and even beyond what Alice famous was pointing out in his tweets from Denver when you're on your iPhone when you're using the search feature you're using Google Search there there's always been an arrangement between\nApple and Google with respect to search for some of the things that can cook is lamenting when he talks about privacy or things that in some ways the iPhone enabled by merging you towards using Google Search in some settings but I think that it speaks to the bigger issue here which is that for many of these companies they're troubles with governments are very complex and they're pretty wide ranging\nShould any tech company be framing the conversation right now especially a conversation about regulation on privacy\nWhether they should or they shouldn't be framing it they certainly are and that's because these companies don't want to be regulated in a way that affects their ability to collect information and monetize it and many of them are really worried in particular because of what happened in Europe and in California over the better part of the past few years\nYou're put in place very very tough restrictions on how companies can collect can use information and then California wedding had ended its own version of that sort of the GDP are as we call it for the United states these companies don't want to\nBut how companies can collect can use information and then California wedding head and get its own version of that sort of the GDP are as we call it\nFor the United states these companies don't want to have to follow multiple sets of rules and different parts of the country so that's why you're seeing them talk so much about regulation because it's in their interest to set the rules to have a voice in the conversation so to speak so that they aren't burdened by a regulation put forward\nBy government that is Tony rom tech

reluctant to death because this driver I don't think could have passed a the most basic safety safety test\nHe was just so incompetent and ah he had no business transferring the public at all so um what we're looking for is just some bare minimum of safety training some safety attracts you to see that someone actually has a confident and safe driver before they're allowed to pick up members of the public because when you call it over you don't\nIt's it's a complete stranger who's coming to pick you up you don't know how safe are are confident they are\nOr earlier this month Hoover

suddenly\nA gritty is they phenomena and it's it's not something that anybody myself for the flyers explains expected\nWhy were you expecting such a negative reaction well have you ever been to

they have great knowledge about each sport\nUm and they don't like any fooling around you know they want to get to what they want to win so they when you throw some marketing it ... the fact that this has come you know thinking way to get people to love the flyers um they're against it in in Philadelphia in tough stance I Do not like you know the furry creatures however\nWell the document comes from first they have listening sessions around the world and they asked bishop to pull their um used community there was a survey for Catholics teenagers sixteen and twenty nine\nTo fill out there and what they're hoping from the church or why they've fallen away from the church and the bishops were meant to bring those stories to Rome to discuss how to better\nCompany youth and welcome you back to\nChurch who may have left and better realized they um\nExperiences and and the questions that young people are asking about their church today is there anything bind doing about the document well look at the official church teaching 'em but it it it depends really I think on the local bishops 'em and communities to implement them\nNow you you you mentioned you know being outside and of course you're protests have taken outside of the Vatican and the Senate what kind of reaction did you get there\nThere are just ten percent of the participants are women within the Senate ... show on the day that the Senate began we had a witness outside the Senate gates and to call for women to vote within within the Senate hall basically ... called the bishops out by name and say we see what you're doing a near closing the door and making decisions without\nUs so we were able to peacefully protest outside the Senate hall I'm also praying of for twenty five minutes ago before the Roman police came and I'm\nAsked us to stop basically I was held for simply by my arm and everyone was forced show identification ...\nWhat about the reaction from the crowds were there any ... or any reaction from ... ... or ... people observing up notably to\nProfit from Ireland came and greeted us and and to our materials the fact that women cannot vote in a meeting in two thousand Eighteen it's it's pretty absurd to most people so we got a lot of support from people walking by\nNow Pope Francis has promised to put more women and leadership roles and after five years there are only six women in you know what can be defined as leadership roles at the Vatican what more would you like from him\nWell there are things that he could do immediately and he could appoint women took the position of leadership I'm across the Vatican today that positions that don't require\nWell there are things that he could get a need at the end he could appoint went into positions of leadership I'm across the Vatican today that conditions that don't require ordination and\nNow there's been a lot of criticism of Pope Francis about how slow he has been to understand the sex abuse issue within the Catholic Church and how he said the right things but has has has been very slow to act\nI'm there hasn't been as much public criticism towards him about women do you think he gets the issue of of why women should be included in in the Catholic Church and given leadership positions\nMany of us are calling for all any and are not satisfied by the slow progress at his papacy to bring women into you know substantial leadership position\nMhm but do you think you get the you\nKnow I I really hope that he is able to meet with men who I call to be praised as a pastor I Know that he would respond to them with a a generous heart and they hope that he has a man of conversion\nYeah no I understand that that's what you hope I guess what I'm trying to ask you is do you think that Pope Francis is a Catholic leader who can grasp uh why it's necessary in two thousand and Eighteen to fully include women um\nI guess I'll have to see so far he hasn't made any moves to include women in substantial voting to shed or made tremendous steps towards women in the position so I mean five years in a lot of us are are you know\nTired of waiting and but I I I Do think that it ... it takes time for change to happen
