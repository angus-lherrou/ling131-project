one of those two categories\nBut actually belongs to a third category according to an e anti disinformation website this video was staged and it is crumbling propaganda Nikolai ... is a reporter and a video producer with mashable dot com\n[laughter] when I first of all what kind of on line reaction and comments has this video provoked\nWell first of all before people figure it out of there was a fake video it received quite a substantial\nCoverage in terms of western media everybody was jumping on sort of the ... of a you know this woman in Russia actually as a in preparation for this thing you just open Google and I and I wrote viral spreading video I just wanted to see which ... which article that are going to be first they actually you can still see\nThat the majority of the articles in the Google Search or remain the the videos that don't know that it's it's actually a stage stage protest or or a fake process so that's actually quite interesting\nHow do you know it said what what what what was the evidence that was presented that say that this was a fake story that this man's betting thing was just staged\nWhen I first of all say what is really strange is that the female blogger in in the video the blogger that's talking about that Senate staging that's a protest or has been known in Russia to do this in the past but unlike this uh particular video she has\nBrought a serious issue is like a you know ups courting and other forms of sexual\nAssault that women in Russia and faith and what what struck me about this video that the tone was very differently and it was almost aggressive and the way that she was approaching so called men spreading a\nPeople on on the subway and it it just seems a little bit off in how she was trying to prove a point about an issue like meant renting which was an entirely different ballpark to ups courting once\nThe article on the eve that's information side came out the evidence that they give\nFor it being fake that he was actually published by a an outlet that's owned by Russia Today which is a you know a media outlet that directly owned by the Kremlin or the outlet it's called into now which used to be a show on the arts website which is now its own sort of vertical and it's quite popular on Facebook\nThat's where the the video that when most viral west coast it and that that that that he actually still is on line or there are other versions of the video that were posted on YouTube where have now been taken down but the original video\nOr Facebook video it actually still\nOn Facebook and I think at the time that I checked it had like six million views [laughter]\nI wouldn't do part of the debunking that are the men who are in it because if people haven't seen the video men are sitting man's betting

paid\nThere's there's an online magazine in ... in St Petersburg called ... and uh they hosted some interviews with one of the men who appeared to video\nWho said that he was actually paid and that's the only other other testimonies of people of men into video posted online on social media thing or you know that they appeared in the video and they were a couple of paid actors and I think\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nIt posted some interviews with one of the men who appeared to video\nWho said that he was actually page and that's the only other other testimonies of people of men into video were posted online on social media saying uh you know that they appeared in the video and they were a couple of paid actors and I think ... posts with you know you ... you come in for a job with little pair of pants and you and you leave with money in your pocket [noise]\nUm and then what will you know once once to sort of the investigation got a little bit deeper turned out that potentially get this video was filmed by um by a studio that that are known to have worked with Archie and with the Kremlin and in the past so the connections become you know more and more clear that the deeper you look\nWhy would this be of interest as Kremlin propaganda why what what's why why did the same as like a a not a large issue for the state government why why would they they ... how to find something like this\nIt's it's one of [noise] it's it's it's sort of like one of many uh issue said they tried to sort of like sport debate and and and sort of their anger and the reason why we're talking about it's just they got caught and that's the thing that I think is different now than let's say two or three years ago and uh what\nThe video was basically trying to do is trying to show how a woman is you know is going too far she's being aggressive in in sort of protecting her so cold you know in in quotation marks or her feminist sort of ... and ...\nThat only goal is to store I'm On a feminist sentimentality in in in people around the world particularly people and the west but it's also you know once this goes back to Russia you know it allows politicians\nFor example to it's a talking point where they can go back and then sort of\nStarts to pour it into more conservative parts of the country I think there was one politician one uh from from putting ... who said\nReally nasty things about this a activist in about ten minutes and journals so it allows them to actually bring back\nCertain points about how important is to keep a conservative society and to have it shouldn't be like misled by liberal or a radical liberal sort of ideas like feminism and things like that\nWhen you said that that when you checked on line ... just to now you found that to some sites don't seem to know that at stake I Do think it's more the case that they don't care that they are not talking about mainstream media but do you think that there is it to the point now where it doesn't even matter if it's too as long as it's effective\nYes um I think I think\nSo I don't know if it well I don't know if the desired effect is actually achieved I Know that the if the article that to you this from ... ah I added a comment that had fourteen thousand likes a as sort of proof that people are are getting kind of enraged by the by the staging acting that it that it potentially\nHave started some anti feminist a sentiment but I to be honest I think\nWe shouldn't place too much emphasis on on these kinds of attempt at propaganda they they are they are plentiful and they exist across confident in in in in Europe and in in the U.S\nBut I don't think there are sort of\nLike a started to worry too much about these kinds of temperature isn't that the the Kremlin is attempting you know different kinds of propaganda a
