about this visit\nYeah I Do know that his fiance did indeed say that he was worried about going to the conflict but that he had received assurances from his diplomatic friends that he would be fine I'm with going\nAnd his fiance was waiting for him outside is that right\nCorrect waiting for him outside um he had\nGiven her several numbers to call if he did not come out again indicating that he was a little nervous about going to the conflict in the first place and then uh he did not come out\nWhat did she do how long did you stay there\nSo she said it for several hours after the conflict had close even\nUm and even the next day ... went back and went back with a number of other journalists to a demand has release my understanding is that um she is a not well over the situation\nBut again and there are there have been reports of of journalists that have been gathering particularly the Turkish Arab journalists coalition that is gathering to\nUm to pressure and and demand answers basically\nIs there any chance that he could have left him that she didn't know about it\nUm I I'm sure that is what is that when what's on all of our minds right now obviously I'm the Saudi authorities are maintaining that he left the conflicts and the latest statement and the thing that they're cooperating with Turkish authorities\nTo try to find him on the Turkish official position from the presidential spokesperson is that\nThey have reason to believe that he is still there\nAs with all constantly since the local authorities who provide the police forces around the country this month the the host country Turkish police who are on the security at the consulate they say they check the security cameras and did not see Mr ...\nLeave the building on foot but they do say that a number of diplomatic cars had been moving in and out of the conflict since Tuesday so\nIs that where your concerns lie\nI'm sure I think there's that and then there are just the concerns that frankly that we're hearing very very different and reflecting theories and explanations from the Saudis and the Turkish authorities\nThem from our efforts at the at the post you know we really we've reached out to both um Saturday in Turkish authorities so we hope that uh the Turks can\nPressure there Saturday counterparts for information for answers I'm I'm sure in an ideal situation a there are CCD

sure who did you get it from\nI got it from both my parents and my grandma\nAnd they were good at arm wrestling they\nWere amazing it on the phone [laughter] did you wrestle them\nWell not my grandmother my dad and my mom that firmly and did they usually win well yeah it's more of a respect thing for me when did you start when did you start to smoke them um well\nI said to smoke my lawn probably around the age of Eighteen and my dad well he's rarely heritage him\n[laughter] so good to practice is your dad exactly and what about that grandmother viewers\nOh she's the brick lane at her age how old is she no she is and their seventies and and to be honest I I'd rather live better age\n[laughter] and and you're you're not wrestling or because you're afraid to yet [laughter] so you okay so obviously comes in family knew inherited but when did you first get interested in competition in arm wrestling\nAbsolutely only covering those things I eat possession ... less than thirty grams or plants less than four that are being cultivated which will be perfectly legal within two weeks I'm only talking about those things not possession of large quantities not trafficking nothing else\nHow many people ... estimate have records ... possession like that\nYou know I've been told numbers that I cannot believe but I've heard that it's five hundred thousand people going back of course decades but certainly it's in the hundreds of thousands coast to coast to coast\nAnd how would ... their lives changed ... they had this ... expunged\nWell the purpose of expunged ... rather than just a part and I think is important if you like ... maybe that you still could face consequences if you have apart and still have to pay six hundred and thirty one dollars that takes you a long time to get a record suspension or pardon\nMy bill would be a Knicks punishment which therefore would allow you to assume that you've never happen it's ... it would be deemed in law that you were never convicted and therefore when you want to go on that cut ... chaperone your your daughter you can honestly say you do not have a criminal record\nAnd that would also be expense for those who ... the United states because of the record\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot EDU\nIn law that you were never convicted and therefore when you want to go on that ... chaperone your your daughter you can honestly say you do not have a criminal record\nAnd that would also be expunged for those who are trying to cross into the United states because of the record\nOne would hope so the logic is there but of course I Can't control what United States does it may be having for example old databases that still show people with criminal records for this one hopes that the data base in Canada will be changed of course and then the Americans use the same data but I Would never want to guess what the Americans will to\nHer dad liberal cabinet minister bill Blair yesterday he said that once marijuana is legalized ... as you mentioned October seventeenth\nHe said that the liberal government will address this issue of criminal records in close and appropriate way and we heard that Ralph Goodell a public safety measures minister while ago he said the government would look to ways to make things fair so what does all that that that the do you think the liberals are supporting your private members bill\nWe're going to find out because I intend to ask them on October seventeenth\nBut honestly I Do hope they do and this is not a partisan issue I think if they characterize it as I Do as a justice issue I'm hopeful they'll they'll do it I think they could have done and should have done when they introduced the kind of a spill in the first place California brought in similar measures Vermont that but I get that they're not saying let's wait until the bill comes into force\nAnd so I'm trying to use this private members bill ... as an effort to kind of nudge them to do the right thing I'm hopefully will\nBut if it seems likely that they are going to do what you're proposing then why not just wait for that why why make this noise now when it's likely just going to evolve in that direction anyways\nWell maybe you're more optimistic than I Am certainly talked about this and vague\nTerms I Want to commit them to build this bill this country to several drops with the same kind of legislative draft or who have worked for the the government\nAnd I'm hoping they'll say this is it if they want to tweak it if they want to have proven and run with it nothing would make me happier but I Do not want this to simply linger it seems to me an issue that needs to be addressed because we imposing burdens on hundreds of thousands of Canadians that simply should not have them going forward\nI recall that Stephen Harper government imposed mandatory minimum sentences in six months\nFor uh any pot possession of six plants or less a which I understand the number of people were affected by that we spoke with billions and you know that just while ago who is a minister in that cabinet too was supported those mandatory minimum sentences he's now\nIn the business he says that ... is a wonderful therapy for people and it's a great business opportunity what do you say to those who supported this in the past and now see it as an opportunity for them\nWell I'm not going to comment on business decisions that they made and what some would see as a slightly hypocritical position I understand that what you're suggesting but\nTruly this has to be something that the liberals and conservatives support this is something that we should all pass ideally by unanimous resolution if possible so we can write this injustice going forward\nDo you think that conservatives will support you Bill\nKnow I've talked to a couple of the mind the culture of the justice committee sort of dealing with the right people and uh I've talked to one so far and I hope that they will I think they get the basic point about the injustice and\nI'm hoping like me that they see that society has changed and the things that might have been treated one way back twenty Thirty years ago is treated in a very different way today we've seen that all over the
