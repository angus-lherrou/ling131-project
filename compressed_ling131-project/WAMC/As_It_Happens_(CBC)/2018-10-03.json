missed that I should find time to listen to it because I mean not asked to comment on it\nYou should listen you said things was invented by men and built by men and becoming a nose turning against a menu invented it to your profession\nI see it and he just forgot to think of vote Marie Curie um you know I mean the fact of history that you know men did go to work and women stayed at home and so there were more men you know that's just that's just a fact I'm but obviously once you've never you know obviously there's people that are making contributions and they should all be recognized\nIs talking about what you should be recognized by which is tripped pulse vacation what is that in layman's terms lay woman's term\nIt's the fact that ah at the time when we were doing this work you could have short pulse lasers or you could have high energy lasers but you couldn't have shortfalls and high energy because of that peak power which\nHe won in order to maybe blow up an Adam and strip the electrons right off the Adam are molecules um if you did it if you read a short pulse through your amplifier you with them blow up your amplifier\nAnd so this is why it didn't happen and so what tripped false amplification did and it's a very simple concept is the fact that we realize now you have to ... the pulse first which\nMeans you stretch the pulse to be many you know orders of magnitude longer\nBut then you can go had an amplifier because now it just seems like a long pulse of amplifier nothing happens to the amplifier and after that then you can ... it also does not destroy the um stretch that you put on it it maintains that and so you can go ahead and compress it back to the way it was except with all the energy\nAnd and now it's ready for the experiment but ... but that didn't layman's terms that's really how to get\nThe shortfalls and high energy for the experiment but not inside the laser\nHas dramatically increased intensity of that post then that's right what what is it they will to do now that you were able to accomplish that what what what ... ... applications is that\n[noise] well of course many of applications for scientific right so this is why we started to study just how molecules and atoms are ionized under these the fields and now bigger than what's holding the electrons to the Adams inside later field and so this was a new sort of paradigm to work and\nIt was a very few years after it was invented that somebody actually commercialized a CPA laser for eye surgery\nAnd this is you know millions of people have had corrective laser eye surgeries and sister\nBut they don't all have to they don't have to use this but millions house yes it did it it is a huge is probably the number one application that still\nWell come on you must be proud of that\nYeah I mean and that's why I found it amazing that um it happened and that so quickly happened than that yes\nAnd it's made a difference in so many lives that's what you called you know what I can only do that no I Know you pay the way the side of the way down the person I mean they made it possible yes\nAnd there's also a lot being made on Twitter that uh you know about winning

Romeo was immediately suspended for his quote unacceptable remarks\nJust Wade is a physicist from imperial college London she attended that someone are we reached him as Wade in London\nIs we had what was the most offensive thing you heard listening to professor ... speaking the other day\nI think that nice defense if if the tokens to say that says it was invented by ... by invitation when actually within has contributed hugely specific throughout the whole of history that friend incredibly long time we haven't documented auto histories and\nWe have to be rainy castle ... we have to remember that it was I Need midway through the last and the women were even able to graduate from ready prestigious universities like Harvard or Cambridge and so that kind of huge impact on physics is only just beginning to happen now\nThis wasn't just some off the cuff remarks that this professor made and that question period this was he gave a series of slides discussing ... can you describe some of the some of the presentation he gave I Know you were in the room for that\nEveryone would have said that you know that was a great idea and that's actually what we're doing by reducing immigration quotas from fifty thousand people per year to forty thousand people per year we're\nActually increasing by twenty percent investments per immigrants so we're actually very much in tune with the current needs of immigrants to invest more in\nThem and that and that's actually a welcoming fake I think that's a good thing\nYeah it's not new money but you're saying that by the by reducing the numbers you have more friends I've been saying\nNo I actually I was agreeing with you that by reducing the number is by twenty percent or ... or actually adding twenty percent more dollars to people who are actually coming here and not give us a chance to integrate them better you see Quebec\nClimate is it is very Francophone so if we don't speak French it's very difficult\nTo talk about integration of new arrivals if we don't speak the same language if you can't borrow a couple of sugar from your neighbor I mean so that's really what we're talking about we're talking about being able to live together\nBeing able to function and work within our province so it's I think a lot of people have vested interest in throwing a Yale random accusations at us I don't think it was entirely accurate to do so\nOkay but not just defense language testing values task to immigrants and that's that would be having deportation failed that test that's\nActually the parental government doesn't have the power to the porch so we\nNever asked a federal government to do it for you but\nWe actually you know we never said that we would ask the federal government to do that reality is what we were proposing is that and it's just something that exists even within Canada that people who emigrated here are asked to adhere to king values in general and that's the only thing that we were suggesting so\nWe're not doing anything more or less than what the federal government's doing on its\nOwn at all or no where where is there a test anywhere else in Canada for your values Canadian values telling me when that happens\nImmigrants that want to come to Quebec are off a series of questions about how life occurs everyday in Canada and our our position is very similar to that and we're asking them to adhere to basic values\nA of Canada whether or not it's a quality of the sexes um are you know a same sex marriage rights very basic things I think anybody who wants to come to Canada should know that this is a place that welcomes diversity and that's basically what the question I wouldn't do and anybody who\nAh wouldn't hypothetically passive I think that would be extremely rare considering\nAnybody who wants to come here is manifestly wants to integrate within our society\nAt that point we would simply say that we don't we won't admit the credential that's required Ottawa at that point or could could walk their limits welcome them anywhere and of course the charter of rights and freedoms would apply so I'm not overly concerned with that\nStreaming support for WAMC comes

it's accurate to say that we could do that because provincial governments don't have the\nPower system makes it to clarify this what we've heard ... is it there would be this past would happen several years after the Iraq to see how they would have been degraded men's language that not too\nSlowly ... that were very welcoming to immigrants and we want them to succeed him are going to be very flexible\nAnd the way that we in the ... circuit fuck shit certificates that of course right now we're in the process of forming are cabinet the premier elect is looking at you forming a his team and I think you know the new immigration minister is going to have the responsibility of clarifying exact rules but I mean I don't think that now is a good time to get into the details as\nTo what that would look like the future immigration minister is going to consult with your crops within the immigration department consult with our federal partners to make sure that we have some good but to be cleared the few wants integration to see a cue wants immigrants to succeed and\nWe want to throw more money at making sure that they do succeed so actually I think our position is very open minded and I think it's ... ...\nWhat about wearing religious symbols restrictions will they be understanding the party would not want people in in the public service teachers to be wearing a overt religious
