...\nWell I wasn't surprised I mean I I'd heard similar charges begin to circulate secondhand people telling me they'd heard them already heard on the grapevine\nA and I thought and good grief I mean why are people bringing this up now because I had a lot of things I agreed with him about and there were a lot of things we disagreed about but it seems to me his opinions are utterly beside the point and irrelevant to the fact that he was a journalist who was murdered and\nWhat are some of the things that you have heard that you that that you found quite alarming that us media commentators have been saying this week\nWell one of the things that's come up is the idea that he was an extremist or an Islamist and at some point people even says so sympathetic towards ...\nAnd uh I think that was really a terrible exaggeration he had some sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood there's no question about that that was something I disagreed with him about a quite a lot but the idea that he was an extremist or that he was a a not a journalist but an an activist\nOr even more than an activist a conspiratorial ... conspirator\nIt was all I think a disturbing because I think a lot of it is quite inaccurate and very exaggerated\nI decided that just basically to the Muslim Brotherhood charge because there there there's different there's varying degrees of radicalism within that organizes eight and ... where was he on the spectrum\nHe was some version of a fellow traveler in other words he says simply he saw them as a legitimate part of the Arab political scene and I think he was sympathetic to Muslim Brotherhood parties in the sense that\nI Would think he was basically one of these people and and there are lots of them who is basically a liberal but who sees the Brotherhood\nAs a core part of our democracy it ... my point of view but it's not a ... an illegitimate eccentric or extreme point of view it's a legitimate perspective\nAnd one of those things that started to float around and was retweeted by none other than Donald Trump junior and it was a photo of Mr ... with Osama bin Laden rattling around Afghanistan and you know just somehow in El ... synthesized said what what's the story behind that\nWell that is that is a really great example of how disgusting this has become because\nAt no point in his life was ... and all kinds of sympathizer or a believer in violence or terrorism he did begin his career as many journalists young journalists um both Arabs and and Americans at a time did covering the war in Afghanistan\nAnd as a as a young Saudi journalist he was able to get in with this new breed of people\nWho at the time we called Arab Afghans or or you know sort of Arab part of the job he did\nA and then eventually some of them more students who becoming hide the fact that he was covering that partly makes him a sympathizer and the great irony of course is that these people got going and they were in Afghanistan and doing what they were doing because the United states was encouraging them to do it\nAny arms that they had came from the United states and essentially involved in an American covert war\nSo what's behind this you can eat you raise the question why several times why is because there are people who knows that the background to this this\nStraightening support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no poll dog harness that did to make it easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... here since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to Todd walk your dog would love that has ever eat eat it at my dog Curtis dot com\nTo kind of say in a very round about way\nThat this isn't all that bad because he was either not a journalist but an activist or even a spirit or and he was not a liberal he was in Islam is or even an extremist and the terrorists or something you know ... those are the kind of progression of absurdity that you get\nAnd anywhere you go in this direction I think he's intended to make people feel\nLess alarmed less horrified less angry and to recast the as less of an outrage you know this is not the time and moment to have a debate about ... complex political opinions on that would've been before he was killed or a long time after the cases are resolved\nRight now the only thing we can be gained by is frankly is to try to imply that it's not that big a deal and I find that horrible\nI Wonder who who the target is because the same time we have seen a Donald Trump said that journalists at the enemy the people he praised politician for having a ... a journalist so obviously there is no love lost their so who who's the intended target for this\nI think the intended audience is people on the right of the American spectrum or others who are primed to thanks very badly about the Muslim Brotherhood may be supportive of Israel people on the Christian right intense secularists which means we put me in that last kept but still\nThe point is that I think that there's an idea that ... being misrepresented being cast as a better person than he was which is ridiculous but I think that's the idea and that people who can really learn what he actually thought\nWe'll think again about how bad this was that age\nReally infuriating and they're not all lives like any good conspiratorial urban legend there's a grain of truth in parts of it but uh I think the only thing that can be gained right now by getting into it is to make people care less about the fact\nThat he's gone missing and probably that\nDoes this indicate though that how much they are worried about this story and about the the impact there's a lot of people worried about how big an impact is they are and I and\nI Would imagine that they don't want the United states to overreact and certainly there are pro Israel voices who do not want the United states to become too strange from Saudi Arabia I Want to keep the heat on Iran\nAnd want to make sure that this doesn't mess that up and I actually think that's a very important project but I I think that the the these are two different matters you know nothing should justify people's sense of outrage about this a heinous atrocities\nWe leave it there will be following this dynasty thank you\nYou're very welcome Hussein ... has known Jamal ... for more than Fifteen Years he works at the Arab Gulf states Institute at

the more children are going to die on the was watch\nWe also call up on all parties to the conflict to put an absolute end to all great violations against children\nThis means that they must image if you stop attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure including schools hospitals and water systems which I saw a trend show for the Yemeni population as well as you have any children nothing really justifies killing innocent children\nAnd depriving them off their basic rights\nThere's a couple of things that people are saying that immediately have to happen which is number one has to be that the airstrikes by the coalition I have to end the cat the any more interesting would you agree with that\n[noise] uh we would like to really call on all our use of the conflict to make sure that

only seen the situation get was with every passing day and it is sad that that is so much suffering happening\nAnd the world is building a blind eye the parties to the conflict must work to reach an
