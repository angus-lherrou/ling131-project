something more about what made them tick what they were concerned about what they thought about what they cared about where's your genetic data doesn't tell you anything about that but then\nYou get to you know the news the twenty three news partnering with a pharmaceutical company to develop drugs based on the DNA data that they got from twenty three me do you think that changes the calculation

solitary confinement by another name here's what minister Goodell had to say\nIt is not a it is a fundamentally different approach if you go to the to the definition of what you have nations would

to a essentially demonstrate what fall so it's the Saudis have been saying this\nI Want to go to some of these series because what you're saying is that there's confusion about what story they are going to finally come up with an end to stick with is okay so we have tweets from media reports that the Saudis were planning to admit to they were they killed ...\nAh in in interrogation that went bad and so what happened to that theory\nI don't know we don't know what happened to it every a leading a paper and journals opinion had been given the same tip off that that the Saudis were on the edge of doing that right before among my ... strip\nAnd we don't know whether Donald Trump told them not to do that which she might have said you know he believes that you ever admit anything that than the cards in the fall so\nDenied denied and I we don't know if this was a Trump led\nA issue or whether Mohammed bin ... himself and I think this is more likely explanation feels under so much pressure among his royal cousins within the royal court that if he is attached to this low cooperation or not rogue operation his days are numbered in that role\nOkay the other element as you mentioned is the Turkish officials in what they're putting out so you got the possibility that that a downtown and the crown prince and the king or trying to work out what the story is going to be the

the United states Donald Trump\nAs they come to the point where it doesn't matter ... we we know they're lying there saying these things we know it's not too and it doesn't matter that deadline doesn't matter we're just going to at some point to that that now accepted this is what is going to give you the truth even though everyone knows it's not and\nAnd Donald Trump and the the crown

inside Saudi Arabia there is frustration inside the royal court there's anger\nAround Mohammed bin some on that he put them in this position because they actually liked ended mired and respected ...
