story Tom Barrett is the host of the podcast daily tech news show he said before you decide whether to worry about smart speakers you should know what you're worried about\nIt's kind of the new the CIA is listening into my telephone I mean we all had Mike's in our house with telephones a long time ago and there were misperceptions about what could actually be done or even if it could be done how often it was done\nUh it's pretty well audited that these things are only listening for the wake word and not sending things to the cloud I think there's a lot of worry about the wrong things would be smart speakers you should be aware of what it is collecting\nBut on the other hand I don't think that you need to worry that it's constantly spying on you\nYeah I mean I feel like the reason we're having the conversation is fundamentally about this trust thing and it's hard to say yes they're gathering data about you and you don't need to worry about it\nI think it's all about knowing what they're collecting and knowing what they're using it for I think that's where the trucks got lost his people didn't realize it was being collected and what it was being used for people voluntarily let Nielsen collected information about them all the time because they go in with eyes wide open I'm going to get this benefit in exchange for giving them\nThat knowledge and and I think that's the situation you need to adjust yourself to his what benefit am I getting by doing this I'm able to turn the lights off in my house with the speaking of a word is that okay in exchange for Amazon going oh this person that smart lights the next time I go to Amazon dot com I'm going to show them some suggestions for that kind of\nProduct we're kind of like guinea pigs I think at this point for all the technology that's being thrown at us and part of the reason people feel skeptical that this is new in its were the first generation I think you could argue that really are having to wrestle with these questions about privacy can we even really understand the longer term consequences of the decisions were making today\nI I think that's a good point is that nobody knows these companies don't know what the consequences of their collection are uh I think in large part they are doing it out of a profit motivation or it's not necessarily for your good but I don't think they have an evil intent or either\nIt's an amoral intent for a large part and I don't know\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog hardest dot com no joke no poll dog hornets invented to make walks easier for both dogs
