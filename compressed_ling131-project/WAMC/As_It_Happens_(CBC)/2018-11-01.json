designed by humans\nIt is not to be on the Ken of Google\nTo make a system that doesn't come up with criminal background checks every time you search for the name of someone who sounds African American because it may well be that plenty of people have clicked on that in the past but plenty of people can be kind of racist so why would you build a system to replicate that rather than one which actively counts as it\n... it does it gets back to the who decided to question though right I mean you are asking humans to make value judgments in order to create better algorithms and some of the value judgments might be obvious but you know we don't agree on much apparently anymore ever\nI completely agree with you but let's just break this down\nJust looking back in the grand sweep of

distorting force here is going to be capitalism right like the the reason not to make the algorithm transparent is gonna be competition and that seems to be hard for us to overcome\nAnd that's a key argument in my book what we have is systems that are being generated developed and deployed pursue into the logic of capitalism which is fine\nBut actually the consequences are kind of political I'm the logical politics would say actually they should be more used for the common good they should be regulated in a scene where the logic of capitalism says they should be used to compete and they

are you putting things that may make quickly had ours and that to do this story that maybe there was just a a communication problem\nI think to me it was clear what we were doing and the choice that we had made and\nMe it just wasn't a choice that I agreed with in terms of um whether it was a a communication problem or or what have you um I I don't know as much as I'd like perhaps on on exactly what went into that decision I wasn't I wasn't really apprised of it\nAnd did you need to clear out your desk that point\nI left and he was from that day on Monday and then um you know for the next twenty four hours or so I had a thought a lot about it and I had a in a long conversations with my wife and and other people I trust and uh I went back on the on the Tuesday and I clean at my desk\nAnd went to see like to do that you were there to go ... ... ... if you'd like to walk and\nIt's it's ... it's a it's a hard position to get to as a journalist color um to get a job at a at a prominent publication particularly in print in this country and so\nIt's not a decision you made lightly you know I I I'm not an incredibly wealthy person so that the uh the loss of a paycheck is going to be felt but I I mean ultimately I didn't think that I was really making any sort of difference in the area that is the most important to me and if and if that was the case then what was the point standing on\nThe road to in this article when I brought to the newsroom did not matter\nYeah that was the feeling that I had and then I think other journalists of color have that you know we have these experiences and these insights that we've been to the table but we don't feel you know seen or or hurt or or or understood perhaps and that can be a real struggle\nAnd I'm Glad I mean this is something you you walk now do your job because it just burned you so much that this was the case and so we have what have you heard what are you hearing some other journalists of color about your experience the globe\nYeah so I published a piece on Monday I've heard from dozens of journalists of color at a vast majority of whom work in this country and they shared the same experiences of not feeling as though they're represented and not feeling as though their voices are valued and and you know some people have left\nJobs over it some people have taken on different roles just so they don't have to write and so you know what I've heard is that the struggle is is a lot more widespread for journalists of color then people might might recognize\nEvoked as a journalist who ten years and you write in the speech that you say there are solutions that are pretty obvious what are they\nYeah I mean I think sometimes there's a tendency to talk about this issue as though I'm well how are we going to fix it up very complicated but actually I think it's actually very simple I mean you you know you hire more people of color\nYou hear their voices and and and trust them and empower them to to report on what they see as important and you know you elevate them to positions of power prominent so there are\nPeople of color higher up in the chain who can champion those stories and I had to help with their framing and I just think that the solutions are are fairly obvious\nThat what do you think's last with your departure I mean at some level you thinking well maybe I should stay and fight the good fight and that did you leave then you know you'd just once you have people of color in unions and\nYeah I mean I think that's sort of part of the struggle if you leave you can feel like you're letting other people of color down and that's one less\nIn your newsroom yeah I mean I think\nThat sort of part of the struggle\nYou leave you could feel like you're letting other people of color down and that's one less forced to fight for you know the issues that you've you as as important but I think for me ultimately I felt I was a really providing that much help anyway and that my efforts have been sort of few tile and so it was probably time to go but I just didn't make that decision lightly\nSunny will be the day she had speaking with you thank you thank you\nSunny Dylan recently quit his job as a reporter at the globe and mail we reached Mr doing today in Vancouver we did request a response from the globe we did not receive that response before we went to air but you'll find more on the story on our website CBC don't see a ... a I H Mm\nWhat if somebody took your average paperback and trying to roughly one quarter its size and then turn it linked wise to me the words read horizontally you could put the pages up instead of left or right or left to right\nCongratulations if they did that you have a ... of the books are known in the Netherlands where the format was born in English there called flip the box and this month nor North American publisher released the first flip back here\nThere are many versions of four young adult novels by John Green Julie Strauss ... is the president and the publisher of ... books for young readers we reached ms Strauss cable in New York City\nThis just gave a what's it like for you the first time you have to have one of these flip backs in your hands\nUh they were pretty much a revelation to hold in your hand or you can explain and described them as we've been trying for a long time but when you really hold one there is just a perfect balance of design and mechanics and they feel like something really special and you see them for the first time\nHave to say when I haven't had one in my hand because I've decided the images today but it looks like something whose time has come we should've come a long time ago\nWe hope so well and they have been doing this amazing ... and the Netherlands for so many years and they've been introduced in various countries in Europe but really in in their home countries where they've done the best\nAnd it it really is astonishing to me that they haven't made their way over to North America yet but I'm delighted to to bring them here and they they really are sort of an answer to a question I think a lot of print readers have in terms of\nThe portability that were used to in our lifestyle but with the luxury of print that so many of our readers we know prefer\nJust to I Know it's hard to do because you do you see them you can't have that kind of oh my gosh yeah of course yeah as as best you can you describe what one looks like four hour radio listeners\nThere there are several things that make them really special in terms of construction so they're really not just teeny tiny books shrunken down a they're a horizontal format which you can tell when you're looking at it and so they're very genuinely easy to hold in one hand and flip the patches\nThe fine is not a traditionally so inspiring it as a hinged fine see can truly flipped the top open and hold it more or less flat\nFee you have the horizontal aspect\nPlus the sort of top to bottom horizontal reading of the flats finding the hinge and this ingenious flee special nailed paper that's just paper thin but has almost no show through and super sturdy\nThis ingenious flee special ... paper that's just paper thin but has almost no show through and super sturdy\nUnder that when it's closed it's about the size of a smartphone\nYeah it was almost it is almost the exact same size as my smartphone so in in the case of some phones smaller in fact a little tiny bit sicker but easy to slip into it back pocket or even a front pocket\nSo it really is a pocket book I was wondering why they call them pocketbooks I never had a positive yes and the text isn't too small\nThe text is not small at all it's not shrunken down really so when we went into it we broke down the text I worked with my art director here I'm\nAt a certain and we read ... pages of paying attention to lie in town and spacing and the best fonts you could really read it so we worked really hard to be able to have a comfortable reading experience that's the same as almost any print books in the trade\nBut now that the paper is different because in order to have as many pages as you would for a book you need to use a different type of stationary we would describe that for us\nIt is very similar to and in fact is um it is like Bible paper\nUm the publisher the printer that we work with and the Netherlands is historically by trade a Bible publisher and this is an innovation they came up with many years ago um so it does have that same than paper but they get it\nFrom this one single meal and Finland so I Believe where it is reinforced so it really doesn't or if it's quite sturdy\nUm we had a a laundering\nOf one of them in my household my son left one in a pocket which most folks would not survive and yet came out a little soggy on the other side but the paper was completely intact\nSo they can put up with a lot so they'd been you've tested they have been used tested they have made it through an adolescent boys laundry\nAnd which is a good thing because you're the first of these books are going to be for young adult readers is that right\nYup we're launching what John ... with fourth has back lists titles and he is you know his historical young adult author though his readership is very broad and crosses a lot of demographics and one thing we know about young readers and which is across the whole spectrum of people who read our titles is they really love print books\nWe know that they are looking for print titles that are not migrating to eat\nAs some adults have so we know it's something they're looking for\nWhat we know that people would turn to the readers because it had that Compaq major and that was easy to just carry uses light\nAnd it sort of the gas an ice giants like Neptune and Jupiter and we think some of those maybe many of those are one or planets ocean planets ... completely covered by an ocean\nAnd we find many of those in a habitable zone also wants to specially interesting about that is if it's a habitable zone covered with water water will evaporate\nAnd out build an atmosphere water vapor as a common molecules that are around our solar system in the galaxy or nitrogen and C. O. two [noise] so you can imagine this plan is having a nitrogen CEO to water vapor atmosphere\nBut that's just what we need for life that's what the earth was like for billions of years before the bacteria made enough oxygen for animals like us to live\nAnd what are they found them to do is your imagination pigs in what are the possibilities those Hollis planet that could be life as we know it could be people that could be animals who could be things I guess\nThat's all sorts of possibilities\nAnd the other hand you know you look at this positive thing and you think well this is what could happen but we're always making assumptions and I always I'm afraid of assumptions if you assume\nThat whenever a plant and us in the habitable zone as small as got water life starts then there should be life throughout our galaxy but then we would have a problem with the Fermi paradox right cause for him he said well there's no life all through the galaxy why hasn't contacted us this letter there's\nThere's two aspects here one there's so many planets habitable zone\nThat might have a life\nAnd yet we have heard from none of them so it's a big puzzle that we've uncovered as well\nAnd we tried to contact them I don't think we've done that [laughter]\nWell maybe that's the problem is that is right that might be a problem can you just take us back to the day this launch march of two thousand nine what was that like to do that bond to what was it like to be there\nWas absolutely marvelous taxis\nBack to the day this launch march of two thousand and I what was that like to do that launched what was it like to be there\nWas absolutely marvelous to actually see this big rocket and see the you know our space telescope on top of that\nThat was marvelous and I had an opportunity I was told you could be in the control room bill and say your name over a fire or you could spend your time with your family watching a launch well\nAway from the launch I'd spent so much time away from my family building that mission I said no control room would be a wonderful experience but I Would rather be with my family and so my family and I\nAnd some of our colleagues for the measure were sitting there watching this magnificent missile was plume of fire ... going to try it was absolutely marvelous I used to talk about how wonderful that was at night was the most exciting night at my life\nMy wife said no it was the second most exciting your life\nThere for the most exotic ... was ... I Would presume that you got married\nHowever you interpret [laughter]\nWould you win which is over the years and people said you know ... ... you had a lot of pushback and and you you just didn't you know people know credit you with having done that you hadn't been so resistant wouldn't be there\nYes we ... we proposed five different times you know only the fifth proposal was accepted it takes a tremendous amount of work\nAnd I'm from a lot of people to put together a spacecraft proposal Carl Sagan was one of our members our team members I don't know if you remember Carl Sagan of course and every time we would fail I Would ask all the team members do you want to try again\nAnd I had a letter from Carl Sagan yes yes I Want to try again I think it's a great mission and\nI'll be feeling better so a few months later yeah diapers letter on my wall\nSo the Kepler telescope is now retired and I understand there now says project called Tess he's launched this is the satellite is going to be watching those dies\nIt's actually on orbit it's actually sending data back down but they've already found several planets and the nice thing about tennis Kepler was a discovery class mission it was a probe into the galaxy\nOur plan is common or rare earth common or rare just give us those numbers so we can build new missions\nWhich is what kept her did now test comes along and says let's look at the whole sky and find the closest planet to start the plants around the closest stars and so we can examine them\nWith a James Webb telescope and we can examine them with ground based telescopes the new big telescopes coming online and find out more about these individual planets so that's the next step in our exploration of our galaxy\n... appreciate speaking with you thank

time is the assisted evolution and what that really means is acceleration what nature does\nI'm On a longer time frame and the time to do that in a shorter timeframe and will be to do that is that the climate is changing much more quickly than coal can keep up with so\nWe do that really through using things like selective breeding when we will will identify them most recently into resistant Carl's

others corals are the ones that aren't strong and can't adapt to these conditions that we stressed upon them aren't going to survive\nWell and if we do nothing that's exactly what the outcome will be and I think that that fits with a pulling back from the context about what\nWe've observed and we continue to observe the death of call leaks in Nineteen Ninety eight to the El Nino we lucked Eighteen
