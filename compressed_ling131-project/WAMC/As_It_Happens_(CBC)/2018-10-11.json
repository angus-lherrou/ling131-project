the United states contributed about half a trillion dollars to the economy and twenty sixteen and even a whiff of that potential is why there's a race to get to five gee first between companies and even countries\nScott telling you the marketplace reporter and former China correspondent he said the U.S was afford gee winter and China doesn't want that to happen again\nCompanies the innovation that was built on this technology right whether it is social networking or gaming or video a lot of those companies I've built their products on top of this infrastructure were American companies so the U.S was kind of a hub\nFor this you know giant economic boost for the country and that is why so many countries I mean you have the European Union Japan South Korea all investing billions in this tens of billions and then of course there's China\nWhich has invested more than any of these competitors as far as the infrastructure so\nThe assumption is if you're first kind of build this ten lane

open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOf rolling out this infrastructure\nOne of the great big challenges that comes over and over with five gee it's how expensive it is to build the network on one reason is because of the nature of the frequency where these signals are going to be transmitted is the cells are going to have to be really close together so every little physical piece of the infrastructure is going to have to be much closer together\nThan it is now now they don't have to be this big giant cell phone towers the nature of the technology is you know could be a small little pizza box sized thing on top of a light pole but all those have to be installed you have to negotiate with the city or the owner of a house\nTo be able to put it there so one of the price tax and one of the consulting firm said was you know on the order of three hundred billion dollars in the U.S to build this out\nSo what is the timeline for the rollout compared to some of those other places\n[noise] so the first five phones there's talk that they'll be coming out in the next year in two or three years there's\nTalk that some of the networks will be commercial ready to move into this Internet of things these machines that talked to one another will be out on the market\nYou know what's a broader timeline well you know a lot of folks in the industry talk about a five year rollout and even more broadly that each of the past generations of wireless technology three G. for each of those generations has been about a decade so maybe that kind of order of magnitude\nGot hung up the marketplace reporter and our former China correspondent tomorrow in the show we'll talk about the tension between companies who wants to roll out five gee infrastructure\nAnd the cities who want some say in that process [noise] em Ali would and that marketplace act\nThis is eight PM [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] hello I'm Carol Off

family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nI should say at this point it's just the accusations of Turkish and they haven't made his accusations by name\nBut it may be that the Saudi Government just feels like they could act with impunity after all crown prince Mohammed bin Salman since he consolidated power over the kingdom has done a string of things\nWhich really troubled the west at appear to have been misguided best including holding couple of hundred of his country's richest people in the Ritz Carlton against their will temporarily abducting the prime minister of Lebanon and\nWaging a truly a horrific war in Yemen that has been going on now for three years and yet after all that he's welcome pretty warmly by business leaders across the United states and the White House\nSo he may feel look the criticism again and couldn't get it worse or you may feel like nothing it's taught me\nThat why would it matters to them presuming that this is what happened why would it matters so much to get rid of this\nWhy indeed heat for years was a kind of a mouthpiece for the ... he was someone that a lot of western diplomats and journalists will turn to\nTo get a kind of cogent rendition of the royal family's perspective and as a critic styles himself as a kind of loyal opposition Seventy wasn't against the monarchy or the idea of the monarchy\nBut just thought they were making some bad decisions it may be that his particular credibility built up over all those years or his prominence as now a Washington Post a contributor\nOr ... or something to them it maybe they wanted to teach a lesson but it's it's really a puzzle in part because it's foreseeable that a lot of western journalists and western diplomats are going to be alarmed at Richard ...\nGiven that there is no love lost between ... and it took ... minutes Asian and then Saturday ... family so can we really trust the Turks are saying I mean don't don't they don't they have an out against the Saudi royal family\nThere is a kind of a an friendliness between the two governments but there's also kind of friends with both sides have been careful to maintain cordial relations\nThere both important regional players and I think they both feel a need to continue to get along and really it is quite inconvenient for the Turks and for president I Would want\nTo have that rupture now because Saudi is a it's a pretty big trading partner and the economy is in trouble already so there's not much incentive for him to be picking a fight\nWe know in Canada what it is to take on my ... been some on and uh has had quite a desktop with him it was ... he wrote about that\nBut why isn't the rest of the world responded insisting that the U.S doesn't Donald Trump saying he's concerned to them as you can show the hopes his in laws sort itself out what message is is that sending to the Saudi royal family\nWell I think today a President Trump has spoken a little bit more strongly at a little more supportive leave the Turks\nSo the pressure from the U.S is rising a little bit at the same time\nPresident Trump has made clear that he has a high regard for prints positives saw him on the president's son in law visor Jared Kushner has really embraced I'm a Harvard Salma and Saudi Arabia as a partner at the same time the Turkish government ... not super popular in the U.S domestically\nSo it's not it's not an easy decision for the Trump Administration\nThat we're sure of that and like when the Saudis are saying they knew nothing about this and we don't know what happened to him he's not going to show up alive\nNever say never but it every day gets less and less likely and it's really hard for me to believe that the Saudis are keeping 'em someplace\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nPlace I Would

exactly there are going to do it like um that that part I've tried to me by surprise on\nYou know I didn't know\nI didn't I didn't know that we're going to lead Locke writes I thought it would just\nLike stunned but then they asked us to leave about what it was fine\nBecause by the time we were there for at least than fifty minutes so um before we actually win told they actually did all this safety procedure test check on all those stuff so they check to ensure that everything is secure secure so I think that kind of up just to get a lot more comfortable\nAgain I mean people who do this is chip else I've not done it and I know people who have it's quite a memorable day [laughter] so you didn't do much to make it a special lines for you but why did you agreed to be one of these people\nSo it just it just goes to some of the things in this last uh phasing out to sea said pets all diesel cars by twenty thirty zero carbon emissions from your ... your transportation from buses by twenty thirty in the city's\nCharging stations for electric cars a funding for that no registration fees for sustainable vehicles are um all these things are I Will be very difficult to happen in most countries including Canada and this is that would be something to be a lot of pushback\nYes and and and and there there are details which which which has to be explained as well because it's very well protected from the government but\nFor example the taxes on the cost\nIs only the row for the next two years and then we have to do that how is it going and we need to make real plan to actually transform our transport ... very different from from from Canada when it comes to distances\nI mean that markets a small country so also we can have a transition to electric vehicles\nMuch faster than you can kind of that because of the technology here it's I mean we have now for cause actually woodworking mock\n... she you compare um Denmark in Canada and into the distances driving a car really considerable but something that is quite similar is a distance we are as you are from food sources during the winter in from fresh produce or whatever\nAnd one of the plans and part of the plan in Denmark is to get labels on to food in supermarkets did show in climate impact of what this sounds like something that is ambitious as well is it not\nIt is it is it is invasion studied very much depends on how it's being done is it's a real thick ration so you can actually come scare sample a neat a written meat compared to ...\nSo you can actually do a real comparison when you're doing your your your grocery shopping and so it it depends on how the dog we're very positive about doing picture ration on food because we need to change the way we eating as well we need to much less a neat and that and much more vegetables it's an interesting idea and\nCompare it it depends on how it's being introduced\nYou know that the the issue you say that you don't care what other countries are doing you don't it's what you want them to do the same time it is they're not a problem with\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThat we hear this elsewhere saying well why should we be way out there doing something we noted on shoes aren't doing the same thing so I Would you do you expect some pushback from Danes on this\n[noise] no actually we can see it population which actually say now that the climate is it out of the agenda that's a that's a lot of things saying we need to to move on this and if everybody's waiting for somebody else why should we do something when Trump is is it leading to pass it was like why should we do this we got out of this up to ...\nWe need to see just said to ourselves and especially as politicians and I'm saying that's again with the with the un recall in mind what can we do how the steps can we take and then let us be an inspiration and also a a case other countries can learn from\nThat if if you're saying Denmark isn't going far enough where does that leave while he just mentioned counting the U.
