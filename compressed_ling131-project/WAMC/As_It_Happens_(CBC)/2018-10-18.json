economy doing are you worried about a downturn is the government handling the economy well things like that\nThis year though the poll included a new question asking people how much influence they thought tech companies had on the economy\nAt us and founded Seventy eight percent of Americans believe big tech companies like Amazon apple or Google have a good amount or a great deal of influence on the economy\nWhat's surprising is that fewer Americans more like sixty eight percent of people think the president or Congress have that much influence over the economy here to break it down at me Larry Rosen cofounder and president of Edison research\nI remember a survey from the Nineteen nineties did ask the question who gets more credit for the good economy Bill Clinton or Bill Gates and Bill Gates one strongly um I think the American public definitely thinks the president has some influence on the economy definitely blames the president of the economy does badly\nBut I think are

and then obviously politics is very polarizing and divisive right now and yet the strong majority the Seventy eight percent who said tech companies and banks had a lot of influence across political age and gender lines what does that tell you is it are they unifying in a positive way\nWell I think it's important that we clarify that the fact that people say they have a lot of influence on the economy doesn't necessarily mean they think it's a good influence they just see that the employer news there and yeah this was absolutely one of the few areas in our poll where there's almost no difference between Republicans and Democrats in the way they see these things\nSo I think it's just a generalized awareness of what really does drive our economy and it seems to be big companies\nThat
