eight were engulfed in flames\nAnd um the the fact of the the the level of his drinking during high school and college uh too which I'm some have stated on the Republican side that that is beyond the scope of the FBI investigation\nSenator coon actually went on the record to talk about what happened in the moment I'm with Jeff Flake and it it is they ended up in a phone booth together yes where a and apparently the night before\nA senator Kearns sent an impassioned plea to add to Senator Flake saying you know I I really am disappointed in what in the direction I think that you're taking this and I really implore you as a man of faith I think I mean they brought they brought it all out\nAnd then in that phone booth it's my understanding that that ... expressing some remorse about his\nEarlier decisions earlier in the day started coming out and it ends and indicating that he would be voting in favor\nAnd so that dynamic and that relationship it's sort of like a shining moment in on them because it makes me believe that that that does real conversation that like a glimmer of what we hope statesmen we'd be\nIn those moments and then it's my understanding based on a senator Coontz recounting that's that he left the phone booth said that um flake could speak with Rod Rosenstein scene in order to ... talk about what the FBI investigation would involve\nI mean just think this is high drama I Can't even imagine and then all of their colleagues flooded them and ... them all out that you don't see anymore because he's these were a republic\nDrama I Can't even imagine and then all their colleagues flooded them and I might add them all out that you don't\nSee anymore because he's these were a Republican and a Democrat in this highly partisan\nA situation that we're in now they don't talk to each other but flake had a moment of conscience\nAnd he said on sixty minutes last night and he was running for office he never would have done yeah within a literary auto which just speaks to this notion of get real that two rules for uh any elected officials get elected in reelected\nAnd so you know as that that that was huh who taught me that it's really Gordon actually [laughter]\nI have all my credit surely garden but anyway um you know it was really it was startling um and that the the two of them are on sixty minutes together are talking about that\nAt all remains to be seen what ends up happening you know some people say the FBI is going to wrap it up by the end of the day which is ridiculous I mean how can they actually do a good job in the desert ...\nLook the whole thing it's infuriating I mean it's a really infuriating the idea that the White House first of all is lying about what the limits that they've put on the FBI are and we know that they're in and they were told who they can talk to who they can talk to this is really bad stuff um and\nMy question is how many of the people not on the Republican\nSide not necessarily out of the Democratic side\nBut in a middle of watching all of this and saying this isn't fair this isn't the way you're supposed to be doing this who do they think they're kidding right when they when they do this kind of thing as if they're talking down to us and they're telling us that they're not doing one thing in another\nWell I'm I'm a you know really truly believing that they that Mitch McConnell will do\nAnything in his power to get this guy who makes McConnell to me is the bad guy and all this because McConnell wants this done 'em and he thinks that's going to be his legacy and wanted done it's done I wouldn't be one bit surprised to see him say Bye bye now let me in the paper and women's truth ... yeah\nWell you know and and just to back up real quick to what you were saying on as far as a\nAs the the time I lost my thoughts go ahead I I Know we don't go ahead I I I lost my train well\nIt was interesting over the weekend that former FBI Director James Kobe to come up with up at the New York times saying that he's still believe that obviously the career rank and file FBI agents actually come through with actually investigate isn't it properly I thought\nOh that was it because the fact that what you were saying thank you Joe you were talking about a a footing the uh putting the the reins on the FBI investigation but this was after the whole farce during all of the hearing so much they were saying there couldn't be an FBI investigation\nYeah yeah yeah no there's no there's no there's no question about it that we have to find out who the FBI will be reporting to for example\nIf they report to the man who told them what to do the president of the United states we may never hear about it if we hear about it as much of it must be a bunch of lies because this guy's just lives through his teeth all the time you just don't know what what you're going to get what what we do know is how terrible it says\nDon't we don't we don't you think so though I mean if whatever happens happens obviously but ... a week to look a little bit more into this guy and his behavior in any way shape or form seems like a good thing\nOr even to test that attack the money I mean looking at the lives that he told a including um insinuating that he that he had no connection to yell and it turns out he didn't like the his grandfather right with a graduate um and and then just and I hosted all others\nConnections to yell and it turns out he didn't like the his grandfather ride with a graduate um and and then just an I hosted all other somebody um put together a great visual of the number of times that I'm professor Ford or Dr Ford at ... answer the question\nDirectly and then you know and then then the number the number of occurrences where I'm Kavanaugh dodged a question and the number of times the answer correctly in it and I think the ... flu and ... and just like a sea of red for him\nBut you know I'm a ... Russo my wife got into a ... a little bit of a tiff with a lady could result posted the Saturday Night live thing which was in the early ... and and this lady said\nYou know there's nothing funny about any of this so then the question a right way to make a face for those of you\nKnow really well and Matt Damon I mean was a controversial in the me too movement trying to manned plane right you know said that was a career redeeming choice I guess everybody\nWas on our partially agree however he was fired on a really interesting yeah sure then the\nQuestion is is it is it appropriate um to have this kind of humor to the American ... I've always said that what you get on Saturday Night live is closer to the truth than what you get on the ... you know the network of programming um because you know they tell the truth and it was uh paradise hotel yeah yeah yeah yeah we\nLive without talking about the sexual violence it was more about the calendars and all that kind of thing and the and there and yeah I ... and has ... right and\nYou know and what came out in today I guess yesterday and now today describe Charles Weddington who was a former varsity barely a year and a friend a cabin on you know just totally refuted Kavanaugh's um you know oh I just had a few drinks or I just I like to be over but I never\nGot so drunk that I blacked out and what a guy who he's stumbling every time I bought him right I was\nReally ... those who it was it the Princess Bride everybody always corrects me was a he's\n[laughter]\nUh and so and letting some I Believe has a has a date with the FBI my garage on that also yeah um that is a that will be interesting to see what come right out of that but\nHe didn't want to answer the question Joe so in other words they say well you falling down drunk where you did you do this what were you I Know that much of them yeah that was\nSo bizarre and for Jeff Flake last night to say well I Would have been angry to giving him a pass on his behavior was district and\nThe other one was interesting to watch here I'm Sorry for interrupting is Lindsay granted if oh God you know I mean here unless they had one million\nAnti uh telegrams um if they still send telegrams whatever they do not doing that thing so then you say to yourself OK so the next thing we hear about from Lindsey Graham is\nI Believe Jeff Flake is as a good man and he's just frying he's just trying to make America whole again in other words he was doubling back oh I I I Want to turn in general is really what his ...\nHis messages I thought the same having Allen because of the sixty minutes interview he didn't say anything they had him on sixty minutes and he really didn't say anything he was saying that this was bad for the process [noise] um and they I mean but they showed that clip and he was glued\nTo remember a mechanic and well he should have ... yeah and Kate McKinnon portrayal\nOf was bought by the way she can do a white man\nMy name is Ken and well he should have ... yeah and Kate McKinnon portrayal of and it was ... by the way she can do a white man [laughter] you know national treasure what\nTheir hand and bringing in the arm was just saying like a good\nI'm All right or ... or one more question then we'll we'll take a break and come back we'll go to others but the ... when we think about the the timeframe here I'm ... and I just I this is the procedural question I don't know the answer to\nIf so the FBI comes back they presumably give the report to the Senate Judiciary committee and men do they have to call everybody back or can they just make the decisions based on the report or do they have to be another round of here or could there be another round up here they are going to go right\nWell yeah there's reports the White House to go to the vote you know he's got it set up a so that is so that there's going to be a vote and if they had\nBut wouldn't Democrats want to ask I Would think everybody would want to el ... would want\nTo but they're not going to get a chance to they're going to go to the vote or the leader is going to say we're going to vote and if he and they will do it if they have the votes so now you look at Susan Collins who I really have grave doubts about at this stage of the game and you look at some of these other photo Lisa Murkowski ... the\nDo that not always pleasant but then that's what it is\nThat your public radio station and there are these are your programs and you have to do your part so it's as simple as that WAMC dot org WAMC dot ORG if you'd like to call ah that that's OK a it's a one eight hundred three two three nine Tuesday extreme\nBut let me just say one thing you say you have to do your part nobody has to do anything that's the great part about this it's only because you want to we can't tax you we can't reach out through the telephone and tell you you know you always this money and we'll put you in jail if you don't do it\nAnd this is you say it's your public radio station but everywhere I go people say they lived all around the country and they've never heard anything like this before\nWAMC dot O. R. G. W. M. C. dot for all right we have ... and go to those\nThank you Joe I'm a Ron says a Kevin he lied repeatedly by well being questioned by the Senate panel which is a crime correct I'm going to go to our Sarah who's going to tell us whether it is and and he lied about stupid things devil's triangle\nGoofing drinking even if you don't believe he is sold to the doctor for how long has he even still being considered thanks for everything and there's a shoe in cable and let me just say that's a very good point isn't it\nThe idea that the idea that um his demeanor\nWas so bad he was following Trump's orders by the way Trump said you've got to get out there you got to really like when I was incredibly hard as you well not only part of what he was but he was\nThe opposite of what our judicial a person with some ...\nOr did he he was acting like a predator he was yes um and I mean we have to be reminded that this is these are civil proceedings and our criminal person you know and so he he ... ... it's up to the Senate Judiciary committee to think about um [noise] whether it's hard\nTo ... to put that in the category of perjury right about that well\nBecause it's all around the margins just like everything else with his administration that's where they function where it that's that's the great the sweet spot right ... if you can ... he could make an argument\nThat he misspoke or you know that it was that he was trying to articulate there isn't there a lot of pressure right I can think of like fifty different ways for him to say\nThat's not what I meant to say and I'll correct the record but he was under oath and he was under oath and that's\nAnd that should be taken seriously and at the very least that should disqualify him from being an officer of the court which is what judges and lawyers for our we put people in jail for project\nWas at the end of the sixty minutes interview they said um to to both ... and like he should be disqualified if he's going to be wanting to respond to belong to the committee mhm and they both with us so we we were pretty\nWell know you want to live with just come out it's right there yeah right you know black and white and the notion of\nSober as a judge has just been thrown out and you know and he has\nHe he he did lie and and people are going to more people got to come out of the woodwork I mean we have this one guy who used to go to school with him you know gee if you went to a job interview which is this is simply was wide and cried and acted the way you did would you get the job no yeah right so we ever had\nTo a job interview which was this sensibly was lied and cried and acted the way you did what you get the job no yeah right so we ever had when I don't think\nWe've ever had one here at WAMC we've had some pretty interesting interviews over the years but um I don't think we've ever had anybody who cried in the interview\nYou know maybe after ... Iraq I quite the knock them along with crime no no I was er the matinee rang and I\nCried I cried I was just about to say because the legislative because it had its fortieth ... fortieth reunion for this anniversary and I went and that's where we had one of them from bologna and\nGet get this thing done and in the middle of it inexplicably all of a sudden the cheers were coming out I was really was released I ran into an Erickson yesterday and she was a lovely events she she did all the work yeah\nShe was great she and her friends does the word enacted makes me cry all the time [laughter]\nAnd then she so lovely yes\nThe best the best and and a wrong says uh we we did that already thank you sorry about that and ah and anonymous ... no rush from Greenfield says\nThe public knows a debt of gratitude to the courageous forthright and unrelenting women who stopped just flakes elevator\nAnd gave him the opportunity to say something about his decision to vote to approve Brett Kavanaugh and steady chose the shame of self by saying nothing on Mike in camera to the world even if a Kevin ... is confirmed maybe those women should be considered for the Nobel freeze peace prize\nWe're talking about that at the break that that was pretty remarkable and and senator can may not have been at ... and if they hadn't done what they did or going to be\nDebating we're going to be debating flake for a long time learn I just had a little bit of a debate um but the but the fact of the matter is he's the guy who got the FBI investigation going year round and ... and I think\nHe deserves some credit I loved what Joe said before about his was on sixty minutes which I didn't see a assertion that he could not have had done that if he was running for office and that tells you more about our political Clinton than anything else you could possibly believe so I'm willing to give him a break um\nYou know although although uh and you\nJust a further um further Sara's point he didn't have to vote for it to move through to the fore\nEither a ... vote right before he moved ... been in the intervening\nEvent no question about you know you know the fact that he couldn't say anything to these women\nI I don't know if there are no I don't know about that would be what I go ahead I I I don't even know what I was gonna say oh go ahead no I don't know about it because I I don't know if there are\nMany men in his station\nIn the world who would be able to say anything I think that he felt like there's probably nothing that I can say here that's going to\nMake these women feel any better 'cause I think that's where he went what can I Do feel women feel better and clearly there wasn't anything he sort of\nRecognize what they were saying he did in some way validate what he was saying and then he went on to validate what he was saying what they said with his actions so you know I I\nHave to give them like you Alan some credit for doing for doing that but it remains to be seen whether or not he'll vote for him on the center for\nAbsolutely so who knows I mean there's we often thought we've often been told he wants to run for president ah and you know he may be examining a those options are right now but the picture of one's mom or sister or daughters um has to come up uh as\nOptions are right now but the picture of one's mum or sister or daughters um has to come up or as you are doing you know there's a difference between right and wrong he knows what writers here\nThe other thing too though is is to Libya is is that he wouldn't have\nThe ... the the women would not have gone after him in the elevator had he not just announced that he was going to vote it through an absolute you know and I mean that that was what made it it's so compelling because the news had just broken that he was going to ... you\n... you could see the pain on this man's yeah you definitely could listen go on Allen says ... FBI and capital a pat on the good\nNews is that if you if the reports comeback thin or obviously doctored the swing voters should also recognize this un vote\nNo maybe well the only thing that will come out will be some report by the FBI you won't be singing detail you're not going to end up\nNot when the president has said to the FBI here's what you do and here's how you do it and speak to and here's who you don't speak too simple\nAnd run to a says Lindsey Graham his act was the shiny object we watched while they measure clean made the prosecutor disappear that was amazing I saw it I was watching it and I couldn't believe that\nIt's a ... you know grandma say something um and and then she was gone and an eighty\nBryant's um portrayal of her on Saturday Night live is why I went on southwest for us I mean really foreigners and that's all right you're right I've got to fork out in the paper on this baby little babies yeah [laughter] it\nMust have really Hamad or it because It's MORNING she's out apparently guys statement saying you know taking the Republican side on this\nTaking the Republican side yeah yeah oh yeah I didn't see that one\nAnd yeah she's saying that she wouldn't have been able to prosecute\nLess than that the Sam attack\nBecause there's not enough evidence there it's basically undoing testimony is evident\nWhile we do a more will take a break and we'll come\nOut okay we go from needs capital for upcoming Supreme Court case says Mary Russia confirmed capitalized directly related to an upcoming case next month before the Supreme Court gamble the rest of the United states they will need Kevin always vote simply stated it concerns ruling that denies state convictions relating to federal agents\nIs based on double jeopardy productions once done it will give the president power to override any criminal conviction\nBut there is that they would do this I I was watching morning TV sporting and they are I think CNN put the article to one or something like that ... one or two hundred and one point one I'm On the air and it and it really speaks specifically\nA two temperament and to judicial temperament and what you have to do to be confirmed\nForget though you know there are at risk Democrats that people still need to apply pressure toward your Joe mansion camp and even Joe Donnelly even know Donnelly said he would not support the capital nomination you still need to apply pressure to Democrats though are looking at these really can touch was collections and the ...\nAnd so those guys right show or I'm praying that this never gets to the floor it um but you know they are ... and um\nYeah and country before self and all the circumstances because otherwise you're gonna get voted out either way I mean if if you know for this candidate women will revolt ...

the man who calls all accuses liar she lives on his behalf repeatedly why should we believe her when she said she was assaulted she has zero credibility ah yeah\nYeah I Believe I Believe any woman who come down on to say that it's not it really isn't an easy thing um to to the to the public about Sarah\nSo I Want to ask you a question has a very good lawyer um do you think any woman has ever lied about\nBeing sold well\nI think that's the wrong question both my question well\nI think you can keep that one because I think that it puts too much attention on on the victim which we do all the time it puts a magnifying glass on the mic them when really what the process should be is if somebody if someone claims that something like that happen to them there should be an investigation\nWell I agree with that I could couldn't agree more with that but I'm just asking you you say everyone you know I mean I'm concerned that we have seen throughout history people who have done bad things they get mad at a divorced husband they get mad at you know at a boyfriend\nOr the problem is is that one is that those incidents to get blown up to a degree that that undermines the women who have been\nMany many many many many many more women\nHave been abused have been victims of sexual violence than the and and have not spoken up because of the treatment\nWe live or I completely agree with you on the go absolutely right about that nevertheless [noise]\nUm you know you cannot say that I mean I think Sara's point is extremely well taken which is every accusation has to be investigated\nI have no problem with that I also know that throughout history there have been there you go and look at the story of Joseph in the Bible and you'll see\n'em you know it happens that that are you you you're the the\n... yeah no this is actually really important because not biblical story is about a power and control and so it's not gender it's not just sexual assault is not gender specific so if we so framing the question do women lie just further puts us in the\nLong so sorry for examining the the proposition or I Will biology eyes a diverse saying do you ask them liable question do you come on come on yet but it's it's it's once again victimize as women that's basically what the bottom line so we watch victimized as women gets there\nWell continuing to frame the question around women's behavior\nNo no I was not I don't know but yeah I had no no ... I agree with both of you I think every thing has to be investigated the rest of it I asked a simple question and I will not be told not to ask a question by anybody\nThat's okay but we don't have what we don't ... you might not like the answer right I didn't get an answer [laughter] well actually you told me not to ask questions well\nHere I referred my answer my answer is that the that the appropriate question is whether or not people empower lie about sexual assault on either being victims\nYou're not wearing meat or or accusers iron curbed her attacker\nI won't say and the other part of it is the investigator investigatory part of it is well if the John\nI'm a ... without any kind of um\nGets or a part of it is will it be John\nI'm a ... without any kind of um discriminatory whatever you know I mean look at and we haven't right here look at the situation with Sean Morrison his wife the police chief there\nTo cheat right is complicit in all of this you know he knows exactly what's going on he didn't take ... complaints seriously he protected Sean so yeah we can have all these investigations but if the investigations are tainted because we all know women why exactly\nAre you saying that I said all women are no men don't notice I Would resent that\nYes no I did not say that I didn't say that but but the fact that the matter is is that the conversation has to come away from well are there are some women who might make this up to the ... the reality of women's lives and the truth that women live around the fact that\nAll of us are are potential victims of sexual violence I couldn't I couldn't agree more but at some point lawyer Sarah a wonderful lawyer is going to get it to defend somebody who's saying that the woman in the case like what are you going to do then\nDefend someone who says that the women in the case like any attorneys obligation to do it to their client and any attorney who's an officer of the court is obligated to seek the truth\nSo you know that's what we try to do but if women don't come forward it doesn't give U.S attorneys are very many options um other than you know holding vigils are mourning the loss of our friends\nBut I just don't like it when people put words in my mouth nobody would ever know I Know what I said look I have been more critical of governor than just about anybody and all the rest of it but it's an interesting discussion and we should have interesting discussions on the show in my opinion always always and I think\nYou should have people on who I mean shares a lawyer I Am not but people from the D.

I live in Gardiner New York so I have the mountains there\nI'm overlooking me every day when I'm driving and um I I thought that\nIt would be really good to kind of try to write a piece of music really directly inspired by it\nAnd it's and it's people as I mentioned before so each movement I tried to follow somewhat of a traditional symphonic form there's foreign movements although I kind of flip to it would traditionally be the first two\nAnd then\nI when I was interviewing people I had some ... selected number and that number also helped me um get tones that I used to help create little motifs that became let's say the motif the farmer ...\nBe as we mentioned it is for movements is a ... can you describe each movement\n[noise] yeah so we open up with the first movement it's just a ... to the natural land and um I even tried to know Tate a few native birds in there to throw in\n[laughter] and then the second movement\nI even tried to know Tate a few native birds in there to

little back and forth unintentionally ... somebody talking about an issue they were having with one place and another person talking about that other that place or\nThat I helped bring in so yeah the second movement we get more of the conflict in the protesters of the Hudson Valley third movement the farmers and then the fourth movement I kind of try to bring it all home and a look ahead to\nThe

rooms or two words\nThere is kind of the feedback cycle that happened um where I\nSome of it was in real time almost so I might have been composing getting interviews they were informing\nAnd whatnot but then um I Would say by the broadly showcase the music more came first when that was happening but uh yeah it kind of they they both I talk to each other\nDo you feel that there's both of I mean obviously we're talking about the overall the hill the overall beauty\nOf all sir county and its environment so we have that [laughter] but then there's also I think a I'm a melancholy or or there are so you've been an anger that comes over what's being done toward natural resources that reflect in music can smell\nIt definitely is and I tried to throw in some little musical Easter eggs for people that know music\nTo help or [laughter] I don't give me an example of a musical ... okay well giving anything away but will like what would it be a ... well I'm\nMeaning there's certain themes both in a classical romantic music and even a TV and film that are used to be picked kind of dark conflict and I tried to kind of just a sprinkle it in there I see I'm here and there\nSo it's it's just sort of set of set the mood\nExactly yeah yeah um but yeah I I definitely think it I mean it's hard living today in twenty Eighteen to\nNot be aware of all these things and you know I that it's such a no matter what happens with politics I think it's something that crosses every single down just the need for clean air and water\nAnd with that said though that comes off do you think or not to feed your wind here but um do you believe that uh comes off as as overweight as as optimistic if you you leave the peace feeling good about where we live and\nUm yes yes uh but that like the melancholy it's hard to avoid as well yeah um I mean it's but I I Do think that\nThat like the melancholy it's hard to avoid as well yeah um I mean it\nBut I I Do think\nThat where there's a lot more awareness I worry that it might\nBe too little too late but hopefully maybe are helping\nBring awareness through my art and other people like me along with all the various actions we can maybe help continue in that direction\nI did mention that we'll be talking about the positive festival tomorrow but give me a sense of of what the attraction was for you and and why it's important to be a part of this has been oh yeah\nDefinitely and I also just want to quickly mention that I'm a big thank you know arts Mitt Huck Finn and that they're decent realization program that helped get me the funding to um to make this competition possible and\nI really wanted to bring the music to an audience that was diverse and I thought the positive festival whereas they do have a suggested amount for their rich stand that gives you a three day all access pass to the festival\nIt is a pay what you will so even the people that maybe are lower income and can't afford it that they would be able to go and attend the performance as well\nAnd ah the old Dutch church where it's my dream venue because of the acoustics and the beauty of that room um and I was really really happy to be able to have\nA gotten the performance to be had there\n[noise] well ... it sounds like a a great event and you have two chances are one is on friday October fifth of ten pm the other being Saturday October six at one PM in Kingston at the old Dutch church the piece is titled the edge of the hill\nMusician a Michael ... composition the edge of the hills being performed at this year's old positive festival which you can

first time I've come back\nThat's correct and uh they have since toward the world or they have since produce three albums are and they are even more fabulous than they were during that debut back in twenty fourteen and we can't wait to see them again and enjoy their music that's definitely a dance supple show\nSo tell me a little bit of a better sound so the big corporate\n[noise] well it's a it's a very progressive and modern sound um they're based out of Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe so they sing to some of the traditional languages that come from that area of Africa\nA and yet their music as pop really for all intents and purposes which is why the shadows will be bouncing at night\nThat's great a very very cool how do you find those groups I mean how much world travel does it take to find those groups are so\nWell with the fabulous Internet out they're not nearly as much as you might think okay I'm I've become connected to\nSay I wanted to see your passport oh [laughter]\nYeah no passport need it for these shows but I really become connected to a lot of agents and managers over the years who are well connected with these artists that are emerging\nFrom other countries and we'd just be work together to make sure that as their floating through their us tours from here to there from New York City to Montreal I make sure they know that we are beautifully saturated right in the middle and that we would love to experience what they have to offer\n[noise] what do you think of a I'm sure you you have evidence now that you've been able to obtain over the years of of how people have have been um turned on and entranced by the music you presented as a um\nUm turned on and entranced by the music you presented as a um as a result of these of these concerts and and the work that you've done and world music\nWell I've always believed that one of the best way to share other cultures is through music and food\nThings that are accessible and and things that we can relate to a an over the years I think people have really bought into that and they recognize that when they show up and they open their ears they open their minds they open their hearts to the music and the words that are being shared and sometimes even the food\nUm they can experience that culture for for a window of time and then return to the comfort of their homes\nA but yet still have had that opportunity to go there ... and to see what it's like\nAnd ... and I I Know you and I have talked about this before but the the very cool thing about what you do is that a a a a concert goer can walk in and not have any idea of what they're about to expect but have a trust and\nAnd you and in the series that what they're going to hear is going to be pretty cool\nNow that certainly the greatest compliment that anybody can pay to me a as a producer\nI think sometimes people here are the country of origin and they think oh I Know I like Irish music when you may not know that music from Sweden or music from Finland has a Celtic ring to it and if you like Celtic music you'll probably like music from Sweden in Finland as well\nUm but I Do think that it's interesting to people that they can experience something that they may think they know about or they may not know about\n... just intriguing and can add perspective to their world and they come and check it out\n[noise] well there's a wide range of performance was from October through April and you can find out the entire schedule by going to ... and was on your schedule was well\nDid certainly music haven music have another aged out of work

Oregon we have all the wings on our website WAMC dot org slash round table you're listening to round table on WAMC\nWelcome back to the roundtable I'm Sara will do the\nBetween an it guy\nBlind along [noise]\nMy\nMusical mean girls tells the story of Katy herring and she and her parents from Africa to America were Katie will leave behind potentially dangerous animal encounters and learn to navigate the emotionally perilous habitat [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nIf you're building Jerome on fashion Katie loses her way falling in with the superficial click led by alpha female Regina George before she rediscovered or moral center and learns about true friendship also it's very fun [noise]\n\nStarbucks\nThink I may\nStarbucks teach the musical is adapted from the two thousand for film of the same name which was written by Tina Fey adopted from Roseland Wiseman book Queen Bees and wannabes\nThey return to write the book of the musical which features music by Jeff Richmond lyrics by Mel Benjamin and direction and choreography by Casey nickel on the show was nominated for twelve Tony Awards last season a number that should make even a plastic proud\nOctober third is mean girls day and there will be events all over New York city to celebrate to join in on the phone I spoke with Eric ... who plays Katie here and I began by asking or what it's been like two originate this rule on Broadway\nOh my goodness we're catching me sort of at the end of six months from start at the roller coaster to know when it's settling down from the climax and it has been now that there's a little time to breathe and have some hindsight it was better and more crazy\nAnd more fulfilling and more challenging than I think I could have anticipated\nFor so many reasons that\nThe show was\nReally loved by people even before they came into the theater just because they left the source material that Tina wrote the screenplay and then to see them\nHop on board even more when they see what we did with it that that what's the biggest joy and continue to be the the most fun of performing the show every night\nWhere are you familiar with the movie before getting cats oh yeah [laughter]\nI think I mean our our whole cats is ... and early twenties early thirties so we're all in sort of that decade where we were either some people were seeing in theaters if you were like me it came out on DVD and you snuck watching it 'cause it's PG Thirteen\nI'm so that was me it was one of those first PG Thirteen movies that my sister's let me watch with them and I just remember thinking oh this is this is good I don't think a lot of twelve Thirteen year olds have great taste [laughter] time in life\nBut that was the first time I remember watching something and thinking I'd never seen anything like this and I can tell it's different and I don't have the wherewithal to know why but I Know it's smart and\nAs a Thirteen year old person saw all those girls that my own school so even though I didn't realize it was written by you know a grown woman with a daughter that I felt like I was watching something that was true in on it to the high school experience and not what\nWas rooted in stereotypes or in sort of the not to just on PBS but the afterschool special PBS documentary style and I think that's why it\nIs around to this day because it ride that line of teaching you something but it does so in a very we can be funny way\n[laughter] but I hadn't thought about that before how a lot of times when I did not know it of course there's a lot of great team material out there but a lot of times when adults right teen they're like mocking the heck out of their experience like it's like they're so superficial and it doesn't matter I'm like oh they just haven't learned anything to\nFight right they just don't know and that's that's the great thing about doing the show that I get to go back to high school and especially the part that I play it so honestly trying to figure out how to survive and the choices and she makes are all\nWith the good intention or with the intention of well I think this is the right thing to do\nAnd it's funny from an outsider perspective and it's funny in in the shell but I think that's why this material in particular being about high school it has stuck around because Tina didn't play to the lowest common denominator [laughter]\nWhat are some of the main changes I mean\nAround because Tina didn't play to the lowest common denominator [laughter]\nWhat are some of the main changes I mean obviously this is a musical the movie wasn't rental but what are some of the other changes that happened between the film and the show\nAnd the show well the big thing and you know maybe I felt that the most because I play the character but the way Katie more from the movie to now is very different and it was actually something we didn't really realize needed to happen until after our ... and do you see in the movie\nYou're able to fall into low him
