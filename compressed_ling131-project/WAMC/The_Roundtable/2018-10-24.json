Dina WAMC news\nA debate on CBS to New York city between New York governor Andrew Cuomo and his Republican challenger Marc Mauer narrow focused in part on the candidates relationships with President Trump capital corresponded ... reports\nCuomo in Mali narrow argued over who is closer to president Donald Trump Cuomo who's often critical of Trump and his policies repeatedly asked ... whether the GOP candidate is a Trump supporter\nVideo support Donald Trump civil ...\nMile an arrow never directly responded but he said he didn't vote for Trump he been accused Cuomo of previously having a cozy relationship with the president when Trump was a real estate developer in New York\nHere when you were trying to make friends with the president when he first came to office told and you wouldn't run against them and use our had him at your bachelor party I didn't\nTrump did not attend the governors party held in the Nineteen nineties in person but he said a humorous videotape in Albany I'm hearing too wet\nThe three women running to represent New York's twenty first congressional district met to tape their first debate Tuesday a mountain like PBS in Plattsburgh North Country bureau chief type Bradley who was a member of the panel reports there were a number of charged exchanges\nSpeak to our values to what our country really stands for this president once again passes up that opportunity and says something that basically means nothing\nAnd and it's to me I think disturbing is the key word all around I\nAm not a peas are comforted by anything Trump says about this matter by anything or anyone says of this matter because both of them are equally agreed to plead guilty of I'm\nPassing and supporting policies that hurt people that that destroy us human rights and um so to have any of them you know comment and say that something is is bad and should be done um you know not until you actually\nUm take actions imposed sanctions um protect people like you should ah well I Believe anything that they are saying it's it's it's absolutely grandstanding\nIt may be but but again don't you think that or to one in this case gets the high ground he gets the points uh you know he could have shut up a little eager to negotiate it a little league could have done this but he came out ... and of course that puts the United states that are really bad spy\nBut you have to put it in the context of of what's going on and in Turkey and the rest of the bird on or do you have you you absolutely have to I mean he doesn't care about any one look at he's jailed among the most journalists in the ... the world so he's not looking out for journal\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nYeah absolutely it's a it's a I think the disturbing part two is at the bottom of all of this really are the issues of our financial\nConnections with Saudi Arabia and it just goes to show how important a monetary value is to this president and that he's willing to essentially allow our country to be bought\nUh the fact that a country has murdered a reporter who has spoken out against another country I'm is not enough to actually stop and make this president realize that maybe there is a time where we have to put money aside and speak up for\nWhat our country actually believes in and right now I don't think the president has any idea what our country believes it well you know it's\nOne thing to say that the country has been ... but the other problem is that he's been bought\nI mean he's admitted that he has this physical relationship with the Saudis it's all been documented we know what it is um and so that's why the among humans clause I Believe was put in the constitution to make sure\nThat this kind of stuff was going to go on a and that is and that you know he wasn't going to be a friend of\nOf the Russians because the Russians were helping him out fiscally personally fiscally or the or the one uh excuse me or or that the Saudis weren't a helping him out and he said they had I mean we have 'em on tape saying that he's done millions of dollars of business with them so that's that's very scary\nWell I'm not the issue of of handing it over to Congress isn't it it's that it could rational leaders also um have had long standing I mean our our relationship with doing business with Saudi Arabia um definitely predates\nThis administration and so to to then put decision making in the hands of people who may have been affected by their physical ... relationships with the Saudis um\nI don't think that's entirely ethical leader\nThere the the thing here though and people were going to use me of being overly simplistic and I apologize but we're talking about we have this story which is with the Saudis who have ties to people who legitimately terrorize this country\nAnd yet the bigger deal is the migrants caravan bigger deal meaning what is being covered and concerned and the G O P\nA platform for the midterms um which many of us look at it and say this is harrowing but it's not it is certainly not the story that they're making it out to be on these people are not going to come and take over our country\nAnd terrorize us that irony bothers me and I don't I don't know why those jobs are being connected more and I certainly don't know why the Democrats aren't making those connections for\nJoe I think one of the things you gotta look at here is the relationship between the Republicans in in the Senate I think you make a good point about this being related to the election but the but the excuse me the Republicans in the Senate\nBecause I'm up to now they have done nothing to criticize as president but I think this one was too much for even them to stomach so when the president says this is now going to be up to the Senate he's going to say at least those is the way I said come on\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nThis and see if you're going to alienate your basic primary voters who are my people and not yours\nBut I also think it's a ... among the ironies that we're talking about and I are jumping ahead here but I Know are eventually going to talk about his comments yesterday about being a nationalist\nAnd it it it it's it's confusing it's contradictory what does this mean does it mean to he doesn't actually care what happens in any other country but ours unless there is a substantial financial connection that we can somehow benefit from um it's all quite confusing but\nI but I Would I Would just turn around and say exactly what you said at the beginning of this program as good as words don't mean anything I mean I was watching the um I had a was to gym class last night in our class or watch the less waste all\nDonald Trump interview and I mean the the the ... you\nHear him when he's saying these things and she would come out and he goes well I don't mean I looked it doesn't matter\nBut those words do matter so it doesn't it doesn't\nI don't know I don't know what we can expect an an ever a cause we I mean there's I don't always says what he lives um we ... with what means something today is we're going to mean the same thing tomorrow\nIt's always a moving target I don't I don't know how anybody including Republicans and Democrats who are either running with him or against him\nPut their finger down on it and say yes but you said\nBut I think there's a difference to interest in using words that are ... are actually trying to\nLie right there before the people that you're purposely in denial um and then just using words or as he did with this quote here about what happened with the Saudi journalist that just make no sense they just make no sense to say it was the worst cover up\n... how does that even connect to anything that's actually happening here\nOr to say it was a bad original concept I mean these words just don't make any sense I'm so to me that's just another sign of how\nUltimately an intelligent this president as\nWell and they think it's it's all the more importance of why we have to watch what the actions are versus the words um because it's absolutely true that nothing that comes out um is making sense and and you know I Would say I mean obviously the\nThe president is a prime example but I think that that happens a lot in politics in general and you really have to watch you know the actions um whether it's voting records whether it's on pushing policies whether it's imposing sanctions 'em and\nYou know with this administration I think it's just\nWords mean one thing but you know watching what happens with relationships um especially when you're looking at international relations is the whole story I think a lot of stories that we're looking to get it looking at today um there's just all sorts of contradictions that happened um and and that does\nMake it hard to make voting decisions or um to really understand um you can't make a really educated guess for the future of what your your vote might mean because um you're you're hearing one thing and seeing another\nIs that the garbage trucks that the [laughter]\nAll right we've got an hour's worth of okay so I I Want to but I Do want to say\nUm I think you guys don't get this president enough devilish credit\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for

what they were doing that seems to me to be the dog whistle or the or the um the meaning of those words and I think he knows what he's saying I think he knows what he's saying we'll we'll find out soon enough suppose\nYeah I don't I don't agree with you I mean I've gone back and forth and so it seems like he does and and there is a there is a strategy in his mind but it's not as though\nMaybe the first thing he understands but not the second or third but there's not wired it's not there's not a deep ness of of comprehension\nWhen I hear in an example like that just like well my question is are you saying that you can do better like you can be better at covering up the scandal is is that what do you think\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no poll

dot com\nNew York governor of New Jersey Senate races raise moral dilemmas the dams offer elected flawed elected leaders so what does a voter to do party over country\nAnd then that leads to Jason's Letter who says I Hope you will discuss what a shameful display the so called debate was in New York I'm not voting for mowing aerobic woman was horrifying and non substantive about anything also nobody called them out on changing as stance on recreational we'd\nTerry I Know you watched the debate last night where did you make of it well\n[noise] it was alarming I was a not expecting a such a high level of attack that occurred between both of the candidates and I do think that the end of the day that people of New York where the real losers in this debate because the\nImportant issues that are facing our communities in our state we're not really dealt with in any\nUh in in terms of any depth in terms of what real solutions lie there it was really just opposition research or digging as deep as we could into people's passed and throwing mud and the other day nothing was really resolved and so I can certainly sympathize with some of the letters you just received about not knowing what to do\nI don't well what he said\n[laughter] but\nBut in addition leadership is all about character\nAnd uh you know I've had issues with Andrew Cuomo we all know it and um you know uh it's astounding to me that one of the things that ... said that I really did believe or was that to come here to take responsibility for the fact that the people who are surrounding him\nUm [noise] I've been crooks and are going to jail or and he said you know nobody else no the governor would have won under these circumstances now Cuomo winds of course because he's done some very good things in New York state there's no question\nUh when you're talking about minimum wage and uh she she too I'm an old ... those are good things that he has done never and modeling narrow of course is tied to Trump\nAnd modeling arrow wouldn't answer the Trump question by not answering he was answering he was saying a okay I'm there are so so to me um and I listen to it with the same sort of horror\nThat I think Terry I'm settled and we have not discuss this before but um it it was it was um uh like like cage fighting it was it was it was terrible but there's one thing I have to say and that his leadership it's all about leadership\nOr you don't tell me to the ... my point my point here is you want to be led by somebody and you want to know something about that character\nAnd I think we learned a lot about the character of a of a coma last night and I think we may have learned something about uh about mowing arrow who refused to come clean about about his relationship with Trump\nSo it's pretty horrible I Do believe are almost gonna win big time it's New York it's blue and and uh not much change although I suspect some upstate votes May of or some people may come out and and give ... a little bit more of a lift\nOr or I I agree with everything that he just said it's um [noise] uh I\nI just think that there was opportunities there for both candidates to put the months leading aside and really dig down an offer\nI think that it's it's um [noise] uh I I just think that there was opportunities there for both candidates to put the months leading aside and really dig down an offer up their ideas solutions about moving his state forward because we have so many incredibly difficult things to resolve in terms of health care in terms of mass transit\nTerms of a high cost of living and in those things were barely touched on and he didn't they did\nThey did ... touch on the empty AIG or you know close but just grateful on the MTA first you know he's tried to deny that the MTA mess ... that the the ... phone transportation authority was his but it is it's his board he points to the people\nYou'll remember that when they put the three or four stops on the east side I'm I'm new line he stood up there and he beat his chest and he said me me me me I did this\nAnd then when the subway system really fell apart he said it's not mine is the MTA and I have nothing to do with this ... this isn't really mind um I think that that was pretty telling\nI I think also I mean my my assessment the end was that both candidates gave voters lots of reasons to vote against them equally but not a neither candidate really provided the voters a lot of reasons to vote for either\nWhat what would you have liked to see them and in fact more because I listen to a little bit on my way home and I had to change the channel because I like I couldn't hear anyone said sponsors because they were sparring so so hard but I mean what what do you think people want to hear about here in New York\nI think people want to hear a detailed plan about how are you going to reduce our costs of living how are you going to reduce our property taxes how are you going to fund our schools how are you going to actually funding into your house they really going to work regardless of whose fault it is that it's falling apart right now\nThough it was all about blame blame blame and no real solutions I think the ... the American people in the New York if people want to hear some actual solutions these people are about to take on a the leadership of a very large state with a very large budget or with a great deal of responsibility with incredibly diverse population\nAnd it was ... I think Alan actually said it perfectly it was a cage match\nThat um [noise]\nI think really just did public service um [noise] uh it created a real negative uh\nIdea towards what public service me this is not public service public services not standing in a cage and beer fisted fighting your opponent it's about offering solutions in trying to help move people's lives forward\nBut it didn't tell you a lot about these two guys yeah it really did is from ... Andrew Cuomo is in is ferocious that's who's that guy is a you know people I interviewed at Mary Cuomo for a lot a lot a lot a lot of years and I knew Andrew back in the day and he was the enforcer he was a tough guy\nHe was the guy who had around the dirty work\nAh and ah that hasn't changed so so what we have here is the guy who doesn't have a limit he doesn't know when to stop 'em you know it's always is if somebody's going to kill them and you have to kill her first and in in Mali narrows case\nOr you know he couldn't be a stand up guy and say uh you know Trump is look\n... you may you reference Baker a governor Baker\nSomething like Seventy six percent approval rating in New York state in Massachusetts Saturday Seventy six percent as I as I remember it\nAnd uh and you know his opponent is good in the school that door election but he's got to win because people really like of as they would I Would call a republic crack\nA you know he's a he's a Republican but he had democratic values he's he's certainly put some distance between himself and Trump and if ... wanted to win this that was his only way to do it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to Todd walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog current S.\nDot com when he comes up the orchestra no performing Aaron Copeland Lincoln Portrait just before election day November third and fourth at the Fisher center at Bard College the orchestra now dot org\nAlbany distilling bar and bottle shop Seventy five Livingston avenue featuring an array of locally produced beverages announcing barrel age in class one oh one Saturday sales at Albany distilling dot com for information\nStories grocery free hold New York featuring a variety of shrimp centuries for fall planting and bolts for spring flowers Monday through Saturday eight to five Sundays nine to four stories nursery dot com\nH empty it the style little bitter kicks off their thirty four season with the musical Young Frankenstein based on the Mel Brooks film weekends through October twenty eight at the spa little theater Saratoga state park homemade theater dot org\nAnd parts building and don't work Schenectady offering network flooring kitchen and bathroom science and more providing staff large displays samples and design ideas park building and bill work dot com\nComing up today on mid day magazine at noon on WAMC New York governor Andrew Cuomo and duchess county executive mark bow and arrow sparred in their first and probably only debate yesterday\nIn Plattsburgh congresswoman or at least a phonics took on Democrat Tedra Cobb and Lynn Connor the Green Party\nBottle lines have emerged in the latest Saratoga Springs charter reform debate and we'll have a report on Tuesday nights north Adams city council meeting plus the day whether somebody from Paul ... commentary from ... a lot of nice that and the latest from Wall street on midday magazine at noon on WAMC [noise]\nGood morning welcome back to the round table and our panel discussion Allen chart dogs here Terry Gibson and\nJohn Smith we welcome your letters panel of WAMC dot O.

each other each drug barely warmly and Diane Neal has between five and six points in this election and that of course\nEven though her protest is that she's left of center not all the way left but left of center or could it could be that they'll got loose\nAnd so the point made by the letter writer I think is very good well why would you run if in fact you're going to keep the house from flipping\nSo the other letter that we got that is in in that I Want to ask you about is from Betsy who said comments please John\nSo the other letter that we got that is in in that I Want to ask you

legitimate they really are I mean I get I get it I said what I was talking about a valid proposition number one that they really weren't two sides to that issue and and I think there are\n[noise]

so um it has something to watch today I'm\nTerry you mentioned this earlier and I just\nScott old so um it has something to watch today I'm so Terry you mentioned this earlier and I just would like 'em\nTo ah talk about this this was the [noise] the label of of Donald Trump as a nationalist and he said with an exclamation point use that word he likes it and says that as a general rule presidents do not refer to themselves as a nationalist given the ... a\nHistory of the world but as President Trump tries to galvanize his conservative base and turn out in the midterms she's adopted the labels a badge of honor\nAt a rally in Houston this week he embraced the term as unabashedly as he ever has really we're not surprised or we're not supposed to use that word he told supporters and a nod to the usual political sensibilities\nThat he relishes disrupting you know that what I Am I'm a nationalist okay I'm a nationalist nationalist nationalist use that word used that word nationalist now he certainly is [laughter]\nAfter the oval office why he used the word given its association with racist movements was drummed profess ignorance of its history\nBut did not back off I never heard that theory about being a national and she said I've heard them all but I'm somebody who loves our country undaunted he add I'm a nationalist it's a word that hasn't been used too much\nSome people use it but I'm very proud some ah some people use it but I'm very proud I think it should be brought back oh here's a case of run back\nTo what Ninety two or thirty eight yeah I mean you know that guy used ... nationalist also\nYeah yeah well\nThat may very well be his agenda I mean this is a case where he clearly knows what his base\nThinks about the interpretation of this word regardless of how you want to define it any other dictionary and that that's the reason he ... he he knows that his base will justify this meeting white nationalism and he knows that that is popular he knows that that is what they want to hear and um it works\nThey love it and so\nYou can see why he would be bringing this up can I ask a question though ... pardon me for being naive but we say it works and I know we talk about this all the time works for the base of works for the base that works for the ... works for the base anybody else this wouldn't work for what is it about this guy were works\n... rich powerful seemingly person and people gravitate towards towards that um you know and and he's got he's got a captive audience he knows\nThat millions of people are watching him and they are watching him and and so I think he is you know\nBefore being a president he was a very savvy about his messaging and who the audience was and I think that's why it's working 'cause he knows he has a very loyal dedicated audience\nAnd you take a look at the history of this thing and you could trace it right back from the civil war in my opinion a you know that that this group or is that look they're attacking they're attacking a the Georgia\nOr you know gubernatorial candidate a black woman um who who burn had the temerity to ... ... as a twenty six twenty six years ago or something like that

white supremacy and as Alan said it goes all the way back to the history of our country and the civil war and it just goes to show how we still as a country has not recovered\nFrom the divisiveness that was ... that that it began with slavery that went through the civil war we still haven't recovered from that and there is a a significant number millions and millions millions of people in this country especially in the south that are still hanging onto the heritage issue\nAnd they are the ones that look at Donald Trump as the carrier of that Confederate flag and so when he uses these terms um they love it and it's nothing\nAll day I'm Sorry that say nothing of David Duke and his relationship now or the president announced the relationship with Trump what do you think that that is that's the Ku Klux Klan folks twenty five seconds\nJim yeah and I think it also this messaging comes at a time where there's a lot of people in this nation who are are feeling very vulnerable very fragile

into the summer sorry to bother you\nAnd in January they released their most recent album I can feel your creep into my private life\n\nReally an experience of hearing myself speaking to a friend and telling her about some of my travels in Kenya and just a just an observation I use my weight woman's voice to tell stories of travels with African men so that\nYou know it really was just a fact of something that happened but you know an examining a white woman grew up in the suburbs of Connecticut\nWhy did I have that experience why would I be able to have that experience of travelling to Kenya what is the historical context which which I talk about I'm\nTraveling with with you know specifically the man that I spent some time with in Kenya where did the uncomfortable dynamics because certainly there were so many dynamics you know as I as a Twenty one year old student\nI'm In a white woman traveling in Kenya I could you know I was living in the legacy of colonialism I was living in a like legacy of neocolonialism and and what America does to quote developing countries\nAnd the legacy of racism around the planet so um you know at Twenty one I think the way that I dealt with that was I'm feeling a lot of shame and doing you know engaging a lot of self destructive behavior\nI'm and I'm Still trying to unwind you know how how do you why the white person reckon with the place that I have in this system that we're in which really is a system of white supremacy and then how do I\nForgive myself enough so that it can move forward and be part of healing um instead of a self destruction that that really doesn't um that doesn't help anyone and just brings me down\nI Love the idea of co conspirator you know even the word\nAlly it still has a sense of supremacy like it's still has a sense of like okay well I'm not like you but I'm going to support you and be your friend and that still has air of a hierarchy of some sort and\nThe deal is we are all losing we're all losing out we're not losing out in the same ways and certainly not the same extent but\nWhen I get to the core of what I lose out\nOn living in the system of white supremacy than I have a lot of incentive to work you know if I'm just working as a favor to you then that's that's limited and and also I'm not seeing how you know to paraphrase my humanity is wrapped\nAnd yours like my humanity depends upon\nJustice being served to all humans and and I absolutely think that is um\nYou know if we if we're if we're ready\nJustice being served to all humans and and I absolutely think that is um\nYou know if we if we're if we're ready to get on that level than does this work that needs to be done and and won't be done in my lifetime you know but it still needs to continuously be done and I I feel really clearly about that and I love the idea of co conspirator you know that this is\nThis is um you know allegiance beyond differences this is all of us are struggling and and of course this has to do with how we need to struggle for climate justice and\nUm you know all that the real terrorists that were feasting on the planet we can stay we can stay in our differences we can honor our differences but really there's a lot of work to be done to really understand one another enough to to move forward to do is really really difficult work ahead of us\nThe tune yards tour that it's

I'm a storyteller and what I Am particularly interested in is the moment where I'm\nHistory meets fiction where it meets\nMiss a one of the kind of watch words that I have is that thinking is that the John Ford the great John Ford film I'm the man who shot liberty violence or ... when the reporter says to a James Stewart or Jimmy Stewart says you're ... you're not going to print it the story I just told ya\nAnd the horses no senator\nYou're in the west and when the legend becomes fact\nPrint the legend and and that's so much of what I find really interesting and history is the fact that we almost invariably always do print the legend time Tom I disagree with me there but so much of what we take to be historical fact\nIs a is a mistake I got particularly interested in World War one I was looking for something that was a really representative\nOr act and I came up with the last battalion which is very you know pretty well known I think but even as this this the ... of a of of New Yorkers metropolitan Seventy seven division we're stuck in his pocket in I'm In the Meuse Argonne Forest a\nEven as this five day a catastrophe was going on they were dubbed the last battalion buy a copy editor in New York and uh so so they six hundred men walked into this place five days later a hundred and ten men\nLimped out and they they were mythic ... um to me that's really fascinating\nSo it seems as though the ... in in keeping with that line of thought it seems that the elephant in the room and any conversation like this especially in a in a public conversation is the the inevitable\nDiscussion of how this applies to what's happening today\nYes I suppose it is it would have been an it's an interesting interesting discussion\nYou regardless of what's happening today but I think today it takes on a a a sharp medicine or relevance poignancy even uh I Would differentiate myth from if we're talking about fake news right yeah I think\nSo you have ... so um but obviously with with the archives I mean your your job is to is really to bring that history to life and to show us what is there and what we have and and really to help keep those facts straight that's exactly\nWhat archives do they know maintain and preserve that historical record that's created at the time so that people who want to understand the troops have a place where they can find it\nMy understanding of the nearest at our cousins as one of the fun\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nLaw in Nineteen Seventy one but New York is a very old state so the state archives as fortunate to have the opportunity to preserve the records of the new another one colony as well as the records of the construction of the Erie Canal\nThe records of the construction of the New York state thruway the records of a Nelson Rockefeller as a early environmental activism and everything in between\nIf I could add the world's largest records of motion screen plays a fifty five or fifty seven thousand documents related from Nineteen Twenty one to Nineteen sixty five during the censorship years so filmmakers from Alfred Hitchcock\nOrson Welles um everyone that made a movie at that time of need to go needs to go through the censure process in New York in New York is the only state that held the record or the other states burned them so [laughter]\nAnd there you go [noise] well it's a lovely event that will be taking place tomorrow night it's October twenty fifth at seven o'clock at chancellor it's all in this state education building right in Washington avenue\nIn Albany Steven Wang is the award winning stage in film actor writer and producer he will receive which one Eighteen Empire State archives in history award from the New York state archives partnership trust tomorrow night\nMy thanks to you Steven congratulations center you being with us thanks also of course two of my ... and Tom roller thank you for your great work who she had a thank you you're listening to the roundtable one WAMC\nSupport for WAMC comes some delivered ... ...

PC\nAbsolutely ... absolutely although I I Want to be clear because I'm not saying I'm even if it may just be semantics you know that we are to blame 'em I think there are things that we do and I say we because again I'm a parent and I do this even though I Know not to do it\nUm but we do have control and I think the two main things that we can typically are the parents can typically do better on is one\nValidating our toddlers emotions um and to using more using our attention more strategically so when a child is let's say freaking out about not getting another cookie or not being able to watch another show or having their brush their teeth [noise]\nI think typically the beginning of that melt down maybe about this thing at hand you know I Want\nAnother cookie because cookies are the most delicious thing um and then they can really quickly slide into you don't understand how big a deal this is for me I Need to really make myself heard\nAnd we do that as adults as well I mean the last time that you explain to your partner or your friend you know something that was going really badly for you if they\nMake light of it or just try to cheer you up with out here you know like that doesn't sound so bad you'll get you'll say oh you don't think so well let me tell you the same story again I'm and get louder and your heart will start beating and that's what we do and we don't feel like our emotions are being taken seriously\nAnd so I think that's something that we frequently do as parents that can make tantrums worst saying things like come on it's just a cookie it's not the end of the world or okay okay okay I get it you want another cookie but let's not spend all day on you know somehow belittling not in any\nIt's not the end of the world or\nOkay okay okay I get it you want another cookie but let's not spend all day on you know somehow belittling not in any mean or intentional way what our child is going through can I think making their protest\nA lot louder and more intense because at that point it's about you know you don't get it so I'm going to keep upping the ante until you get how big a deal this is for me\nSo I understand and we were talking about you know cookies and working in the toy you want and and so I get that but you also write about things that that are\nReally tough difficult circumstances whether that be a moving whether that be divorce going from one parent to another there are also very serious things that\nThere are strategies for for managing tantrums under those very difficult conditions\nAbsolutely and with all those things I say that you know I I I give those kind of brief treatment in the book because I think it's very important to remember that at those times\nTantrums are going to happen more but there are other books and articles that dive into those more deeply\nUm I think that again\nParents will say something like oh well this you know the move clearly isn't affecting my child very much or you know the fact that the nanny just disappeared\nOvernight isn't really affecting my child and then in the next breath they'll say\nBut they've had so many more tantrums or they're ... they're so much more stubborn and so it's important for parents to recognize that that is the tantrum is how the child is potentially expressing that they are having a hard time your three year old isn't going to say\nMy new bedroom is really unfamiliar and I don't understand why we have to drive everywhere when we used to take the subway\nPlease help me work through that they're going to pitch a fit that they have to go to bed [noise] um and so I think it's important to learn to interpret behavior that way\nAnd then the rule of thumb that I talk about in the book is when when in doubt um about a specific strategy to use although we can certainly talk about those two you want to look at the levels of love in your home and love is a shorthand for kind of connectedness and warmth and affection\nAnd also the the level of limits and not income but says structure and routines and you want to make sure particularly during really difficult transitions\nFor families that those two things are both high that you're spending connected time with your child that you're really tuning into them that you're putting your phone away some times that you're\nEnjoying the things they like to play with with them and also that you have an abandoned all semblance of what day to day life looks like a regular bedtime regular eating times expectations around what one does it meals what one does in the morning when it's time to get ready to go to preschool\n[noise] I think though as a general rule of thumb going for those guidelines during difficult times is the place to start\nWhat may jump onto the idea of the general rule of thumb when do children typically quote unquote grow out of town from\n[noise] are we going to move to talk about tantrums and adults too [laughter]\nYou had me listen to the news by the way right before I Know is not I mean before recording is not the way to get my nerves down right now\nI'm just so I think I mean it's a very good question most of the time tantrums are on their way out tantrums the way we typically think of them are on their way out fully by about six or seven um and they're starting to be out depending on\nOn their way out tensions that way we typically think of them are on their way out fully by about six or seven\nUm and they're starting to be out depending on the child by age five and I think it depends a lot again on\nAnd and I'm Talking about and typically you know develop mentally normal right I'm I'm not talking about exposure to ... you know that sort of thing and it's when kids develop other ways of coping with their emotions including language\nAnd as that gets more advanced than other parts of their brain that are responsible for for example impulse control and judgment and planning as those areas of the brain get more mature and better able to communicate with each other\nYou start to see fewer tantrums because the other skills that one can you use to channel emotions and express emotions become more advanced\nAnd doesn't school enter into a two and they become more socialized they're they're around other kids it's different\nYeah absolutely I mean exactly they're they're maturing they're gaining different experiences they're learning how to um adjust their behavior depending on setting they're learning that\nYou know if you're holding a fall in um you know a quiet religious setting you can't pitch it across the room and if you're holding a ball at a picnic and a field you can all those types of things which again are about\nThe brain being able to categorize different things and different expectations that that's\nWhy we don't always think about it but that the function of brain development of executive functioning which is the part of our brain that can do those types of advanced skills developing\nThe
