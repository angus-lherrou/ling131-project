G. seat which was certainly going to be controlled by a Democrat in the matter what\nAnd what's the most recent polling do we have what do you know the ... most recent polls\nAye June ... daughter

wrong lately including a copy of court cases are up there in uh in Queens in which she um in which she beat the pole by fifty percentage points can you imagine\nA you know Donald Trump was losing was behind in the polls and you know the thing that people were not going to admit that they were going to be voting for him so you know a\nTurnout is came right turn out is ... and more than ever this year and I must say there are some things I don't get for example\nDon't I don't always get the New York times so they have this article in the paper yesterday in which they say\nHispanics may not end up voting I'm In this election or because you know then there's they have conflicting thoughts about whether to turn out or not and I know I didn't I didn't I don't really believe that for the way I just don't believe that\nI think that the what would be a big disappointment is if the millennials joined I felt that if we see college age students not coming out uh uh I think that would be you know pretty disappointing\nWell it but it would be consistent yeah but we professors have always found in the past or in fact they used to be a very bad joke about the only way to get him out would be to to to light a fire cracker or you know underneath them because I'm a it is never been a case that young people get out but\nI think that's definitely changing now at least one hand on at least what I'm seeing not just on college campuses they even high school I mean we have we have a high school age students who are are counting the days until they can vote and that's a level of engagement that that we haven't seen in a very long time boy I Hope you're right\nSo the the pollsters are out in full force 'em both yesterday and today I'm Talking about the uh the house and Senate and the the the basic um [noise] the the narrative seems to be the Democrats\nCan win two hundred and twenty six seats in the house majority well Republicans will win two hundred and nine seats but they point out um they also say that Republicans were all fifty one so you can read and maintain control the Senate but they do say\nUm that Republicans that it's important to look at the margin of error which gives the Republicans are very good chance of maintaining their control of the house of the house you know [noise]\nSo um which goes back to what we all have been saying I think\nFor several weeks now the turnout is key and it is very close yeah which I think we knew from the beginning right you remember\nOne of the great moments of whoever whatever advertising genius thought this up and said I could add a V. eight because the day after this election they're going to be double lacking themselves on the side of the head in so many very close races who say I should have voted\nWell it's interesting because I think generally speaking all politics are local and elections are such\nBut uh I think the Republicans have smartly made this a year and which is not about local but it's about national I think the Democrats are making that St push too and so the idea resent about your respective candidate but who you're can't they represent at about Donald Trump so this has become a national agenda\nThat scare issue for me though is voter suppression I mean one thing you can turn out as many votes voters and you went to the polls that if they can't vote sure and if they don't they\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nPredicted to possibly lose by point eight\nYeah it's not only that but they've disqualified\nWell over a hundred thousand voters and they passed themselves\nThis very interesting law and which they said if you didn't vote in the last couple of elections are we going to end the spring quote by the way has said that's okay with us\nAnd if you're going to see more of this uh if you didn't vote in an election or one or lecture to elections you can't vote anymore unless you're re register a and here's the interesting thing about that\nYou know block floating is very important in America no matter what people want to believe\n'em and one of the reasons Brock Obama won the presidency is there is dark numbers of black voters who came out and voted because he was the candidate now you get Stacey Abrams in Georgia and they know what they're doing when they say\nTo basically black voting populations or you can come out and you can vote we're going to change the rules so that only we can win look we see this in American politics all the time\nWe see it right here you're talking about the state Senate state Senate leader the Republican leader goes up to the great computer and says great computer drawing the districts where we can lose and that's not Democrats dumb democracy I mean it's crazy and and and sharing your point about what's happening in Georgia is equally disgraceful yeah\nAnd that but we have in Florida I mean I don't know if you if you're caught any of the the gubernatorial debate last night but we have\nUm a really exciting candidate and in Florida who's actually up a couple of percentage points the same same issue same rumors and then the president tweeting about voter fraud humor is a non issue it just statistically\nOr you had a he had a commission that he created and the commission had to you know well they closed up shop I don't have any hope that it might exactly even their own even his own proponents said there wasn't anything and they knew that wasn't there was a reporter of elections in office do state says that's not an issue\nNot an issue and I mean I think speaking of the Supreme Court it goes back to the to the erosion of the of the rights to voters and the voting rights act\nSo in our few moments before we go to a break when you talk about suppression of the vote you gave a Ford as an example and and before the Georgia he is now a the however many\nDays we'll do sixteen days as keeping Eighteen but I don't think that's right there so it's two weeks or his two weeks and the other day so that would be Fifteen facts right and you're right okay\nSo um but my question is do you have enough time to try to make that situation better in this voter suppression especially when it comes to er or keying into\nThat at very least informing voters of what they can do to make sure that they can do\nWell on the the thing at very least I think that's where it's at campaigns would be wise to have to invest any remaining funds that they have and if they if they aren't cashing ounce um their media buys that they should use any of those extra funds to do voter education because you're absolutely right and monitoring I mean I I started to pull monitor\n'em in several contentious races including um you know when Cory Booker first ran for mayor I was a poll monitor in the north word\nUm and and he was receiving death threats and campaign and they were busing in his his opponent Sharpe James I'm with bussing in people from Pennsylvania to intimidate voters that the polls and where his campaign ... I'm ... and so um I think the attorney general's office actually um ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nYou know when you have and when you have an elderly voters being brought in and and and being there they're the people who are helping them being turned away so that they don't they they can't pull that\nWe think Paul the the the lover or sell out the bubble for the candidate that they want so many issues on site I think campaigns would be wise to educate voters to get 'em campaign staff\nOn site at at the most important point places and then to staff up their lawyers I have to say you got I mean election lawyers are going to be in high demand and the next couple of weeks\nYou know it was interesting about the Florida race were the governor says we've got to find ways to allow the people in the panhandle to vote and you say to yourself well now we know he's the Republican\nAnd what does he have to um is this because he knows that you know there just isn't right or that he knows that his votes are there\nThe media has had a lot of um self reflection about that\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nI mean professionally despondent\nIn other words that the Republicans are going to keep it all the New York times Hispanic votes um you know all that stuff I don't believe anybody any more I think the day is going to come when we're going to have an election and people are going to decide to go out or not and I see from men this evidence of excitement or ... on on a\nFrankly both bases but particularly on the Democratic base\nI just just encourage my just go out and vote it's it it it's so frustrating that I mean I think we may see some decent numbers this year as I got maybe not historic but certainly within the last two decades a voter turnout either really what's at stake\nOf but you're right there okay\nEr and Kennedy writes to us about the trans gender discrimination with the proposed new definition of gender could a man walk into the Miss Universe dressing room just saying and claim he was born a woman does this we define stop and frisk don't the police have more important things to do from Ken\nWell this is the topic we're well we'll talk about ...\nAnd then there are none that currently go ahead and John said let's do what do you get the caravan and then we'll get to that but go ahead John says\nLatino voters I'm a fifth generation Hispanic as the above is not my real name\nAnd what your panel doesn't seem to understand is a social values tend to along with conservative one the brake tends to happen with immigration however as time goes by and we increase our numbers of generations that becomes less of an issue as many of my co workers are either not voting or like me will be voting the Republican Party line\nI Would disagree that I think most nationwide most of the social issues take on a more of a of a democratic appeal\n[noise] well I mean if your kids can't get healthcare and if they can't get fed and if you're in a particular demographic uh it ain't good\nAt our other too many Republicans who want to get rid of a a cuts in Social Security and Medicaid I think we had a Democrat you mean ... well ... ... Republicans ... across the country are not are not supporting that measure\nI think we have to be really careful about who he who we put under the label Latino or in Latin acts that that encompasses a lot of different continents actually I'm In generations of of voters and so\nWhat what may be a conservative broad way too broad I mean that the if you want to look at at Cuban mailed over the age of fifty um then you might see something different than Guatemalan you know women between the ages of twenty five and forty\nSo I it's it's really tough to to do any sort of protective analysis of of how entire swaths of of the of our population will go like that\nWill lose this letter from John who says that's not his real name and it's certainly not Hispanic name that he is I'm a ... interesting in that ... basic predictor he's using here is that um they\nWill be people who come to this country and we've seen it all denominations\nWho say pull up the gang plant I'm here pull up again click on anybody else you know\nWell that that can be an issue with waves of of immigrants in our country we've seen it before on well we'll talk about the caravan um but you know Irish that there are

um [laughter] [laughter] okay\nSo let's go to the caravan story this is a the pictures of this are starting to me I Believe um that it's continuing north defy Mexico and the United states and open defiance\nOf those governments thousands of Central American undocumented migrants most of the Caribbean and that has been heading toward the United states for more than a week resume their journey on Sunday\nIn southern Mexico the Mexican government which has been under pressure by President Trump to stop the caravan has ordered the migrants to submit to processing by the immigration authorities at a legal border crossing\nWith thousands chose instead to move on part of a group of people who have\nBeen stopped at the Mexican border this week after having traveled for several days most from their homes in Honduras most of the migrants on the move on Sunday by one local government estimates more than seven thousand people across the border illegally in recent days by swimming or wrapping across\nThe river that separates Guatemala from Mexico or Sarah you obviously um are are very in tune with this issue\nAnd I'm I'm curious as to what is happening and ultimately what\nFor a group of of say seven thousand people the goal is to walked\n\nWell I Can't speak for that seven thousand people but um it sounds like they're starting to\nUh make their demands clear I I think I read that they they took a vote there they're starting to get to self organized around what about group decision making I'm sort of what we saw in the Occupy movement and when you see a group called last like that and you can't predict the outcome\nBut you can be sure that that that the authority figures in this case many different governments in different countries are going to have to respond in one way or another that response little reflect on us\nWhile you're at it or whether it's talking about what Trump said about them\nA he said that there were many dangerous as individuals in in the group\nI don't remember the word many ... is\nIs that it could this be the can this be that unexpected October surprise you know the cost of the next week week and a half\nSeven thousand migrants are going to come near close to the U.S border at some point in time and what is this country going to do what is what is the president going to order\nA the military to do and how ugly can just turn out to be and what will Republicans who don't want to see a women and and and children each slaughtered you know what what could they be\nWell you know there's another way to look at this and that is what's the Democratic response to this in other words Trump thinks he has an issue let's keep the immigrants out or we haven't heard from trucks\nStreaming support for WAMC come from birch are Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've got strict to me and gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for one three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nResponds that we're looking to because I guarantee you there are Democrats in this country who have grazed problems with immigration\nAnd that is we should sort of super liberals or you know saying this stuff we we'd better we'd better put our thinking caps on a in terms of what of what the expectations oh we'll be uh on the part of all voters yeah\nWell it's a human rights issue of I mean we can frame it as a democratic issue but um [noise]\nAnd I'm interested to hear what you think that the Democrats issues with immigration are aside from a political conundrum which um is only that much of a conundrum because of\nThe Republican stronghold in my view on on on on a level of government quite frankly right now but\nUm if we look at it through a human rights lens\n... it doesn't have to be left or right it's it's what are we morally obligated to do not just morally obligated what're we obligated to do under the refugee convention where the conventions in place why are these people fleeing their country what are the conditions that lead them to flee to these countries and what hand and we have\nWhat handed the United states government has ended stapling the regions of hunt or the countries of Honduras and El Salvador and what what what are we going to do about\nSeven those are all great questions on a fortunate we have an administration that takes all those things at this regards each and every one of them\nYoung and thinks thinks that the issue works for them not in terms of the rest of us but in terms of the the voters who are going to go out and either respond to this or not and apparently they are responding positively ... you know it's I I ... I Love having sour on this program because what\nYou just said is really my views but I'll president doesn't have a moral compass so unfortunately the intellectual you as we saw with separating children from your mother's no you're wrong he does have a moral compass and\n[laughter] and what [laughter] and on and on a good area or immoral ... ... what does this already ...

doesn't feel secure about their own situation they're less likely to welcome competition\nThere are many aspect of this and I agree with much of what you folks are saying but knowledge and some of the problems with unlimited a migration would balance the conversation I Believe I said that earlier today by the way\nWe can and actually typically we can absorb many many many many more people because the refugee camp had been lowered to historic lows it it just looks scary because of the way that the pictures are\n... that that goes back to when Hitler was pointing at saying that\nThose people

we can't really say that's really interesting let's work on it next spring they really need it now\nAnd so we are developing a new internship I'm with the help of the more Fox here I'm ... money to

impressed us\nUm and I I I'm with their dedication their commitment and their ability to bring together what they're learning in the classroom what they're learning in the community\nAnd sharing that

beautiful art does it does it's um [noise]\nLet me find a non clumsy way to ask this question which is the central question which is how much of what you have to do is\nUnlike other subjects do you have to mirror his style because of what you of what you're doing is telling his story so is is that a challenge to you at all of of yes we are presenting those representing his story but I also have to come close to vote look of atomic\n... well that that's a great question and um I wouldn't say it was hard but you know if you want to do something good it's always going to be a challenge writer um\nI wanted to do come up with his style you know ... you know some of my books and you you know that I I tend to change from subject matter to subject matter I wanted to do something that was\nA somewhat um distinct from his style but not jarring Lee modern jointly different something that had a a a comfortable relationship with it but not trying to\nUh imitator emulate I'm Thomas call so the distinction was very clear when I use um [noise]\nA reproduction of his work you know I have a reproduction of of a cause great paintings throughout the book that I have um a ... that I've used in inside my art work sort of um [noise]\nBut and and as you said that isn't jarring that that seems to that's actually what made me think of the question because it is it's very complimentary to what you are doing\nYeah really I I'm I'm basically a storyteller I'm just trying to tell his story is the best way I can and obviously you couldn't tell Thomas called story without seeing some of his original art [noise]\nSo um [noise] you know I wanted that sort of montage feeling at um at certain points where I live um included his work but I'm In the context of my own you know sort of\nUm highlighting his\nWhat is it like for an artist is all the story of an artist\nVery personal ... another great question are so much of it I I related to I'm I'm not an immigrant I've you know my family's been here for centuries\nBut um I Do I have to say I followed a dream to come to New York\nAnd come up the Hudson River 'em and go to Europe I Lived in Rome for a year [noise] um when I was in school and that was a great inspiration for Thomas coal his work grew enormously 'em by his tour of Europe he went to England\nOr for a couple of years and then he went down to Italy for over a year and that changed his work a lot and I give them great credit for that because\nA lot of people think of them is self taught which essentially was and he was already famous and unpopular as an

his er\nPhysician about um America following Britain or as the next big industrial empire that's essentially what are the course of empires about it's an allegorical\nA series of of some ancient empires rise and fall um but again it's a cautionary tale he's saying this will happen to us if we don't\nAdhere to what we consider a precious and important to us right now\nHow much of the story you mentioned it in a ... at the start of your answer it when I asked about the uh what it's like for you as an artist to write about an artist and he said well I'm not an immigrant how much of his story comes from that immigrant experience do you think\nWill certainly in reference to ah how he was informed by a where he came from the British um industrial revolution it was highly informed by that [noise]\nUm but also they were uh he got off to a very meager starred his uh his father you know classic um cottage industry they were put out of business because of the industrial revolution they came here\nAnd tried to start over a you know doing you know painting\nA floor clause in window shades and so forth and it did not go well for them for many years he actually walked across um Pennsylvania\nTwice a in search of a you know first going out there to um join his family to help them get started but then once he got the bug to become an artist himself\nOr he walked back all the way to Philadelphia and lived virtually on bread and water so it it's sort of the classic story the starving artist which I'm I'm I'm Glad to say I've never start\n[laughter] get hungry at time close yeah certainly my college\nDays imposed college years so that part of it I I definitely uh could relate to and and and most young artist I Know I've gone through that period too so it's really a classic story what's unusual about him his that\nHe came up here he found as inspiration with the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains brightest paintings back\nPut them in the window and oh by the great fortune um another important artist of the time a John Trumbull was walking by saw them and discovered he was he was Thomas calls discover and he was you know like an overnight success he was the toaster the New York art scene\nOf by the time he was twenty five years old\nThat did not happen to me by the way not having to you so when you look at\nThe the story and a coal story obviously
