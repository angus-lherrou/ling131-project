with them and now\nSo jet I'll I'll let you before we moved into our subjects were today I Want you to go pick a whack at ... at the Halloween and young journalist\nYeah I think you know in terms of our coverage if Trump we're perpetuating often at the same thing that happened during the campaign season which was to focus on him as a primary source for all issues that happen in the U.S and I think\nUh we got to get over that and we have to go to other\nPlaces and and remember that the issues are are happening on the ground not just in the oval office and and he doesn't know everything about everything he's not a primary authority and I think you know we had then demeanor I doubt um\nYou know standing up for what is fact um and and putting that in the grass instead of burying the lead\nWell I'm living on after that during a well I was just say that like to think those of you in the media that are working so hard to actually bring out the truth and an honor to be in the room with those that have done that\nAnd I do just want to say that I Am completely star struck this morning I went to jail or be you know I used to watch her when I was an undergraduate student in my twenties at Lubbock, Texas early in the morning all my friends were out the bar and I would come home to watch Linda Linda all are\nBeing made fun of you know every night they might have what are you in now [laughter] and I have a credit\nLinda what's really bringing my attention to politics and news and uh you had a lot to do such a maid growing up and moving forward\nLiving and made them and everything is today I should I should I Apologize yeah\nYou're a recovering journalist who's a recovering politician reparations in order here that way we can work something out but I Want to ask you can I have a and that is\nUm you know it clearly as a politician you had journalist who wrote stories you thought were either unfair overall absolutely um ... what was your recompense I mean how could you how could you deal with that well\nYou know I think the most frustrating thing is that you you say things are in in well thought out complete sentences complete paragraphs that you mean to be taken as a whole and oftentimes journalist will grab once in a\nSet of contact was out of contact they tell you an ad\nAnd turn into something that you never met and that is always very frustrating but you know I guess for me was always looking at the other side that the downside would be that they just wouldn't cover what I said at all [laughter] uh and that the opportunity to be able to get\nWhat they would cover out in front of the people was better than the alternative so I've always appreciated free press even though I'm you know as a person working the political field it it comes with some pain every now and then\nBut uh the alternative is that they don't cover what's being said and and that would be very damaging so\nUm I think you just have to take it all and balance\nLet's dive in to to do stories will begin in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh some days to begin with hundreds coming together and anguish and grief and synagogues on a grave sides to start the services for those killed\nAs they prayed on the Sabbath in the afternoon that came together again and chose to honor the dead uncomfortable living in a waiter by the thousands and solemn marches protests around the squirrel hill neighborhood where the attack took place on Saturday this is the Pittsburgh the met President Trump who arrived with has met with members of his family on Tuesday I'm\nReading from the New York times the presidential visit welcome by some in Pittsburgh unwanted or vigorously opposed by many others began with the motorcade into the city and visited the tree of life synagogue Mr Trump led memorial candles in the best bill near where the shooting unfolded\nBegan with the motorcade into the city and visited the tree of life synagogue Mr Trump wedding memorial candles investor bill near where the shooting unfolded employer stones and white roses from the White House outside in commemoration of those killed\nIn an attack by a gunman full of anti Semitic rage shouting but Jews must die\nBut if Mr Trump's visit was intended to bring healing and instead weighed bear the nation's deep divisions many protesters in Pittsburgh had no doubt of what one called the dotted line between presidential rhetoric and violence\nThough some people in the city have pushed back on the idea of the Trump had fermented the atmosphere of anger of the president moved round Pittsburgh a largely democratic city the signs of discord were apparent\nAlan\n... going to get in trouble as usual I think I'm the only ones that I think I'm the only Jewish person in the room so right yeah I can only speak for me no I'm not ... who is you know I think I'm the only Jewish person in the room I tell you what really frustrated me frustrated me was the rabbi at the synagogue\nUm who um who\nAre welcome the president and he said he's my president and and therefore and he accompanied him um as as it went around I was extraordinarily frustrated by that because I truly assigned blamed to this president for what has happened I think he did he has said\nAnd he has proudly talked about the fact that he has to have enemies and that he does this kind of thing\nAnd I think that the regime is gone on to some of these paranoid A People's heads is the ... late to him he had ... this morning out there saying he had nothing to do it had nothing to do with the withdrawal of course you had to do with Trump\nIt's ridiculous or because the big and and and I I Wish I Wish I could tell you the Trump doesn't isn't proud of the fact that he's the vice of any makes that kind of thing that happened and now to try it out\nOf a few Jewish relatives are ... and say that this proves that I Am not guilty of any of this is ridiculous and shame on pins that's what I have to say I wonder\nWhat Alan [laughter] they were very find people on both sides have your ... [laughter] no I agree with you completely I it was shameful I hurt\nFor it I I I I I Want to apologize I I'm not sure who I'm apologizing\nFor but I Know who I'm apologizing to ah I'm apologizing to people who have been wrong and had their justice robbed from them and have had hateful things said about them and are now having hateful things done to them and there is no way to escape the connection\nFrom he said today did ... years and [noise] just I think I'm\nOne of the\nBest things that I read lots that past couple of days um has just been the the coverage from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nWho just ... I mean God love those people um rent and and that's why local journalism it's important because they're covering their own community and what they did so well was yes they cover the visit but they covered the funeral brothers their front page had this wonderful interactive or you can\nUm you know wonderful that terrible situation but um they they\nThey put the focus where it matters um which is of these members of the community um who were persecuted because of who they were um and they should\nUm which is of these members of the many um who were persecuted because of who they were\nUm and they showed yes\nThere is so much division but they also showed the capability of being United of schoolchildren I'm just coming together um within twenty four hours after this happening and doing what they could in front of their campuses Holocaust Memorial Day that\nThis was a hate crime they put that it was like the first statement that was said by you know Thirteen fourteen year old\nAnd they know better I'm In that community knows better and I think that um what we can't forget in in this case I'm absolutely we have to watch dog the president's actions and and what is it said um I think the best thing you did yesterday were shut up for four hours and just\nHopefully listen I'm to the people I'm In the time that he's been there but um\nYou know there's there's a lot that the community will have to deal with I've been covering I grew up in the era of of combined been covering mass shooting for a long time now\nUm and this is something that affects the community for a long time um there's a lot of questioning a lot of policies that need to change 'em\nThanks for bringing them into other beyond the penalty this morning she made a made waking up too early as a kid tolerable when the network had nic news ... re runs in the morning such a calm voice in like just in the news for the audience I'm Glad to hear that as a veteran journalist she finds it as hard as I Do to comprehensive little lies and hypocrisy\nOften gets lost over in the headlines and that's treats in ... New York\nAnd Jayme says cable news even though it's far more intellectual and fact based in cable news is today I consider myself to be to be the beginning of cable news a late night reporting an occasional rand's stood the news business ... years you'd start with the model that\nHaven't been copy by many but improved by not and then he says she says gave me\nThank you dot dot dot dot I think [laughter]\nI guess it's an interesting thing is NBC News overnight was actually on NBC a news and not cable but it was put up\nI mean he's got it right it was put on the air because CNN went on the air and they were on the air twenty four hours a day\nAnd the broadcast networks lifted that and went well we haven't been putting anything on the air at that time yeah uh what's the cheapest thing we can put on the cheapest thing we can put on his new\nShow all three broadcast networks went on with late night programming at the same time uh in Nineteen eighty and Nineteen eighty one simply because of of CNN so cable was definitely the cost of it [noise]\nI keep remembering the ... the wonderful admiral movie a goodnight and good luck good night and day out in which they really just the CBS really\nDid sell 'em out and uh they did they didn't they they they did a but that's not new networks of course\nIt was [laughter] I mean that that's one of the things that that is so fascinating about your career because these shows were cheap you will come on and they could do them cheaply and yet they still didn't last\nNo they didn't uh as far as overnight goes I mean we always felt that we were fortunate that we had the opportunity to do the show\nBecause it aired late at night when most of our bosses were asleep and that was if they were old and that was a great opportunity just that alone and because we had no money a better and the president's NBC said we have money for you to do this show\nYou're going to have to talk NBC correspondents\nInto going and cutting a separate piece to err on your show at nights\nNow these are correspondence that have already had to cut one for nightly news and then re cut another when the today show the following morning\nAnd there are going to come and ask them to do yet a third with for no money no extra money\nSo the way we did it was I went around to all the bureau's and I said if you will cut a piece for us we will air it unless there's some glaring changing the story will arid if you got it we will not do it nightly news does and take your four minute peace and reduce it to a minute thirty\nYou can what you could do for us is the piece you really wanted to err on the evening news and they and they said oh my gosh somebody's gonna let me actually report what I thought I should report\nOf the issues that I remember so vividly from that show that I think falls into what you're talking about what's the peace with Andrea Mitchell on earth sized table well above average will did a story about\nI think falls into what you were just talking about what's the fused with Andrea Mitchell\nOn the other side's stable\nWell an existential did a story about President Reagan and the difference between of his uh Prescott of the press availability is an eye on a I'm a photo shoot as opposed to getting any news\nOh yes the heart photo shoot piece was wonderful yeah it was just wonderful I you know we did we we did things like that we did things for fun that had truth and them but we are done for fun one of one of the NBC editors noticed that Ronald Reagan\nA former actor had a habit of saluting everybody not just the marine\nWhen he was getting off the air force but every time\nHe knew he had been in a lot of western said oh I played a lot of cavalry officers\nYou know it's so great that you say that because um some of his stories and now maybe we can attribute some of it's a little later terror of the old timers um were things that he said he did but then he played an actor in a in a\nYou know yes she does editor that went back and got his movies and then got all this footage from his presidency\nAnd just I wrote a lead in about noticing that the president enjoyed saluting seemed to have some talent at it and then we ran a piece of ... of Reagan saluting even a dog\nEverything [laughter] I I I'm not sure if that said anything important you said something and details are important ... certainly\nThere certainly are certainly nobody said something that I I find so interesting when I get up early early early in the morning and the first thing I Do is turn on the live news and it's it's on the cable channel notice to young people who are\nWho are doing the news there in the morning they only have people cut stories the night before\nBut you their names and say you know Dave and

R. G.\nSo we talked about this yesterday and I want to ah talk a little bit about it today which is because we know more than we did yesterday President Trump vowing executive order and birthright citizenship and move the most legal experts say would run afoul of the constitution President Trump's vowing to sign the executive order\nThat would seek the end\nTo the right to end the right to US citizenship for children in the United states to non citizens to move the most legal experts say would run afoul of the constitution and that was dismissed Tuesday by the house is top Republican this is really be forward to the story um\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan dismissed the idea during ... a radio interview saying it's not consistent with the fourteenth amendment of the constitution\nHe said quote well you obviously cannot do that you could not end birthright citizenship with an executive order\nRight and also said the Republicans did not like it when president Barack Obama change immigration policy by executive action and the altering the constitution would be a lengthy process filling out\nWell I said it earlier today and I I mean you can't obviously it's a joke you can't alters the Constitution's by signing an executive order\nOr otherwise maybe a former president or to have gotten rid of the electoral college or by just the you know signing a little signing an awesome you know sign off however there are those people who discount the band who became president in the United states Donald Trump\nWho I consider to be as reprehensible as anybody who has ever served in that office\nOr as not being like he's bridal right you know in a evil devilish weight\nAnd when he says if you come to this country and you shouldn't have a baby who then automatically becomes a citizen then an awful lot of people in his group who are going to say right on done that's exactly how I feel about it that's wrong\nI'm so his point has been made to all of those people even if he seems like an idiot to all of us has ever taken a political science class or about the United States Constitution\nI think the danger too is if you know is there anything 'cause he will try anything and possible to if he can't completely overturn what can you do to chip away\nAt at that the infrastructure of what that allows and I think that's something you got to watch if you are right

didn't see it I never said it uh I feel that very last night but that was made by the television that's all right it\nSounds a well first of all I think you were saying I I Can't tell you what a special special day this is where it's um you know putting that together or was one of the most fun nice job by the way thank you and thanks to Sarah for for a\nCoping it altogether and producing it's a beautifully um you know I I uh going through those clips and and I realized what an impact you had had on on me\nOr as a journalist I uh I guess it was it was it's no secret I'm a huge Letterman fan and and so I started watching that show and you when you came on after uh I Would watch that and I was I was trans fix or by what you were doing Terry mentioned this earlier\nAnd it was just so

had a cable access was just coming in I had a little in high school I had cable access TV show\nAnd I didn't like it but I Love being on the radio and broadcasting and the one thing that that book

was struck you you ended our last of our bedroom and your grade Donald Trump story but you know I was struck by you did an interview with Robin Roberts will be in\nYour final interview before your retirement\nAnd ... says or anything you're going to mess and you mentioned as you mentioned the nurses there was the first campaign that you would set up since Nineteen Seventy two and a Robin Roberts ... or ... or you said about that and you said well no because I don't know how I Would explain Donald Trump to children\n[noise] I still don't know I really don't ah how how\nAny of the ways that I Would believe or the right way to explain it would make some people very angry and we'd make other people say well she's not object is well you know my feelings on that\nThere's no such thing as objective you go to a story you bring everything you've ever seen written read heard you bring yourself to that story now you try to be fair you try to give it a fair look but you don't show up as a ... that's that's not even a computer can't name a random number\n[noise] ah I I could look at this thing with Donald Trump and I thought and and this was\nIt by the way this wasn't because boy I think Hillary is so great I mean if this was about knowing that there was no equivalency there that it was not the same thing at all\nThat politically and idiot logically you might say well they're very different but they're similar but one is saying and one is not ... period\nAnd how could I go on and treat it gives them the same amount of time and treated as though it was equal without saying you know there's something wrong with this man and he's a liar and he's always been a liar\n... it seems so it seems so telling because of again in that montage of all the stories that you covered the weather was nine eleven were [noise] um I ... the program you did on aids was I think one of the most amazing his journalism I've ever seen\n'em and and that you can put that into a context but then this guy comes around and it's really fun way we do\nBe thought of me I had no idea how I Would explain it uh because what we had done in previous elections was we would we would do a ... a a\nR shows were single subject shows so we do one show on the ... of the candidates okay and one shows on their policies and then we\nDo one show where we go around the country and we videotaped children asking what they wanted to ask the candidates now that she's obviously after the primaries is is when it's ... to or in one year it was three 'cause we had Ross Perot and we flew to them\n[noise] ah [noise] and then we ... the president's would sit down with us and we would play those tapes the candidates and they would answer them and they would answer them seriously and I could not see how I could put on a biography\nOf Donald Trump knowing how much of it with a lot what he was putting out I live in New York I Lived there forty years I'd watch this man go bankrupt I watched him stiff working companies and people he'd used I you know you could say about her emails\nOr yeah but but his history his work so couldn't do that and then when it came down to okay well what are their policies will ...\nSo I couldn't do that and then when it came down to okay well what are their policies well\n\nHe he didn't really have policies I other than to call people by names we had already done in our show on the uh the it's not just solution the least a de ... of silt civil intercourse\n... ... in in the public arena in America [noise]\nThere was nothing about this campaign that I that I wanted to\nCover and no way I could figure out to explain it\nTo what my own truth believed was all my heart or to even pretend to seem fair [noise] I ... and when it got down to the end and when it got down to the point where only one of two people was going to occupy the White House either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump\nWas going to be president\nAnd the only way to keep him out was to actively go and vote hurrying\nSitting back and saying you know Bernie didn't get the nomination so I'm not going to vote was vote for Trump voting for Jill Stein was the vote for Trump just not liking are not voting because they're all both equal to vote for Trump\nAnd in the end I I ...

young people on Nick news has been our guests this morning and we have a few more moments with er which I'm thrilled about\nWhat us talk for a moment about the uh when when overnight we were talking about overnight right before the break\nA you'd mentioned Ruben Frank a couple of times ah this this man a and I really only know of him through reading your books\nAnd ah and then and then subsequently reading about him but he was really a pioneer because a weekend it was his idea a overnight was his idea he had a he had an interesting vision for news especially the network\nLevel he did and he also had an interesting vision for television that has been lost he one of the ... one of the many wise things he said to me was he said okay take the today show for example if he said now going the other room or take any new show\nNightly news anything not turn it on the television and going the other room\nAnd listen to it like you're getting made up in the morning or like you're cooking dinner was edgy he said if everything is understandable to you from the other room there is a word for that and that word is radio television not compel you to watch\nThe pictures come first the words come second so I became one of the ... at that time only two\nCorrespondents who would cut the picture first and then go back in ... ad narration only where it was absolutely necessary and let the let the stories be told by the picture and by the people in the stories and we continued that at ... news\n[noise] but you are writing is what I mean you're writing is gorgeous\nMy writing my my writing goal was always to see how much I could not write how much like the first show that I did a show called weekend for Reuben the piece was twenty minutes long and I wrote thirty for second\nMuch I could not write how much like the first show that I did a show called weekend for Reuben the piece was twenty minutes long and I wrote thirty four seconds of narration so I thought I was close to achieving my goal [laughter]\nAnd in fact the first piece that I cut which was at a summation of the Nineteen eighty election or that aired on nightly news and I had put the whole thing together with soundbites and music\nOr the ... it was a six minute peace and John Chancellor refused to introduce me when he introduced the piece he refused to say\nAnd here is this piece from Linda Eller be because he said\nThere is no narration how could she have written it and I wrote it with the picture\nRight and that's what rooms and taught me yeah that and and\nThings like there's never shortages I Can't say that word a hose [laughter]\nYou know you I remember I just just flashed into my mind um and I remember a this is actually women for this was when I realized that you lived here around here was uh the movie broadcast news came up and you wrote a review of\nI wrote the review for the London times and it was picked up and it ran you know in other papers around\nHere I think you you told the story about leaving in your jeep going from um ah the Berkshires coming over to Albany here to see the movie yes and um and I just I remember the vividly a but there again was another kind of a A N and an insight into\nFolded ABC and that's the one I chose\nI Want to play a debated a long time or whether it's going to play this clip or not it'll become obvious as to why I debated for so long but this was you as a as a guest on the Tonight Show where you're promoting our world\nAll right so the our world has just come out and there was a guest host that night and it's Bill Cosby right here's a here's this Corp [noise]\nOwe you if if if it weren't for you we wouldn't have the show\nReally because ABC\nHis show is is so popular that\nABC decided that Ripley believe it or not which was opposite you just cost a lot of money and didn't get very good ratings so they decided that new show of course cause half the money to produce if we didn't get very good ratings it was okay because they were still making money didn't cost a lot of money to finance so if you work there\nI wouldn't be here [noise]\nYour family as anybody really gotten after you for going up against a show that is as popular as because\nI mean I people do say uh what is your wishing away you have a death wish why why do you insist on continuing to work with no net and I\nI say right away that it's I met Bill Cosby is funnier than I Am [noise] ah but the ... the show is good and so nice thing about being opposite use it's easy for people to remember when it's on ... [laughter]\nOh my God hell times country on the things\nWe didn't know yeah you know early on in television not because of Bill Cosby but because of another man in television I had a very hard and clear lesson that you can lie to the camera that nothing was as easy as a camera\nAnd it was quite possible to be perceived on the air is a good and kind of human person and to be knocked that in real life\nFor you as a reporter of knowing the anchors of knowing the other reporters were was that did you just not want to know a lot of that I mean of course are part of your career doing in the middle of the night so you\nKnow nobody don't have any ... spend your time or they do and and uh NBC nightly news\nThere look there are situations that were that were usually uncomfortable you took a hostile workplace if you have a man on the show who's anchoring a show and he's married to a woman of one race but he brings his mistress of another race into the show regularly\nIt puts you everyone on that show in a very awkward position okay not because of the racial part but because of the cheating\nOn on the spouse part ah yeah yeah me too me too I can say that absolutely honestly now I never nobody ever said if you don't do this you won't get a job\nUh but the hostile workplace absolutely finding reasons to brush up against your breast thinking it's okay to pinch you in the ass as you go by and the elevator\nMaking suggestive remarks telling you that you're actually like put your lady things look really good today ...\n... it was just a fact of life it was how it was and it was horrible\nI don't know that the surprise anybody but Alaska does is that as a question which is when as the me too movement started to unfold the the one of the industries that was hard to sort of course was broadcast\nBut as a question which is when as the me too movement started to unfold the the one of the industries that was hard to sort of course was broadcast journalist\nSharon I'm Matt Lauer and and [noise] um a Charlie Rose and it it I think that I I again I don't I\nPersonally wasn't surprised by that but I Know a lot of people were because these were people that were\nOn the air you think you know them right that's not necessarily true it is with some it's not necessarily not trip there are many very\nNice people and that but there are some who are not and there are some who just simply aren't what they seem to be [noise]\n... well that was one of the things that I thought was always so fascinating about your career is that ... and whether you're in um I'm interested in what you think about those but we always felt that we knew you we had a pretty good sense of who you were\nYou were there you you were comfortable you were wearing jeans and sneakers on you I mean you seem like you were very much at Eddie is\nWell I think also one of the things we did an overnight was we close the show with a quick little personal essay and low it and I would alternate every other night on who did it\nAnd that was a way and it was intentional it was a way for the audience to to get to know what's his people just a little bit the ... what is the premises of overnight was let's see let's see how much of the screen between me and you we can erase ...\nSo that meant you had to let them in a little bit you had to let you had to let trust the viewer enough to let them into your life I mean I remember going on one night\nAnd talking about my mother had died\nAnd telling a story about that I remember another time going on and telling something that was you know something stupid I'd done or ... but they were ways to let people know this is who I Am I'm not just to UC reading words that I wrote earlier\n[noise] the the fact that you you mentioned ...

and when you see a play like that it just makes the world seem larger and it makes you want to expand your own gays or upon the world\nThe other Broadway show that opened last night was a play I'd seen first in two thousand by ... called the Waverly gallery and it's a a portrait of really of his grandmother or a woman with Alzheimer's but starring in it this season is Elaine May who was eighty six years old who of course is\nLegendary ... on the team Nichols and may and basically playing the woman who is she's losing her mind um is improvising\nI mean really trying to sort of fill in the

first time I was I was so great fully aware of this was when I was first in the job and I reviewed Janet tear who is now on Broadway and Bernhardt hamlet Theresa ... Bernhardt\nBut this was a production imported from London of adults house and I thought I don't need to see adults house again I studied in college it seemed to me rather dry ultimately doctrinaire but directed by Anthony Page and starring Janet ... who is a\n... a very tall kind of athletic woman as the doll like wife clearly sort of confined to a role that didn't suitor as if she'd been sort of laced into a course that strangling her\nIt was thrilling and I thought don't ever think you know something unconditionally until you see it performed in another way\nDoes very season a at St john's warehouse in Brooklyn there's the revival of Oklahoma which you must think you know backwards and forwards if you're an American fan of the ...\nThe the bard production last one came from bart for ...
