down to so thunder on politics I for for me kind of captures the totality of that picture with all those different elements in it [noise]\nAnd heading into the midterms I think you asked about well yeah we're seeing it\nOr we're seeing the thunder dome and didn't Georgia I'm In North Dakota where major voter suppression schemes are underway and Trump is out there saying you know I'm tweeting that are across the country we will fight voter fraud the president of the United States isn't door singing voter suppression\nAnd and so there's the thunder dome for you\nSo but but it's good for him ultimately uh it seems as though it was before a win win if if the if the Republicans do very very well in the midterms he can say it's all because of me\nIf the Republicans do poorly or or not as good as they expected to\nHe can say well it's because of voter fraud voter suppression and enough people didn't stand behind me\nWell I'm sure he will say that um and he in fact telegraph that when he expected to lose the twenty sixteen election he he didn't I shouldn't I shouldn't say he telegraph that he said it openly said if I lose the outcome is illegitimate\n[noise] and so of course we'll do that again\nSo the other part of this of course is taking our democracy I'm taking back our democracy so where do you see that uh I mean do you see [laughter] efforts to do that right now\nWell sure I think if you look at Michigan uh there are initiatives on the ballot right now that would put an automatic voter registration and the other\nThings that would make it easier to vote 'em I Will point out and I hope your listeners or take this to heart there are ... governors races in many states across the country and the outcome of those races could really have a major impact on the\nState of our democracy for many years and let me explain why I'm In in in many states governors have the power to veto a congressional and state legislative maps district maps that are drawn by the state legislature now\nIf Democrats win and some of these big states where they can do that\nWhen Republicans tried to gerrymander the maps\nFor the next decade which will come after the census right these governors who when in twenty eight team will be in power when that happens and if there are a lot of Democrats there they can block these maps and force feral ones so a look at Pennsylvania for instance a democratic governor got in there and it\nCatapulted the resulting standoff catapulted the\nPennsylvania um district map into the courts and are the result was a new map out much fairer math that will now result in many more Democrats getting elected it looks like and by the way I should point out it's not just it's not a good thing\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog harness indebted to make it easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the birth here since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to Todd walk your dog would love that is every these at my dog harness dot com\nAnd so my point here is that multiple Democratic governors getting in this cycle means potentially a much less gerrymandered map for another decade\nOr to be fair though I mean I the the the Democrats don't always have the best record in in um setting up these districts either do they mean they they certainly have done their share I yeah yeah\nYou're absolutely right and they have a long and bad history of this too and places like Illinois and Maryland and and I want to say I say in the book very clearly that we cannot stand for it if Democrats do this if they gain ground on the state legislative level\nBut what we need to do is insist unfair maps and one interesting thing that has developed to recently is that Democrats who are investing great amounts of money and taking background on the state legislative and gubernatorial level for the purpose of\nOn reading these maps are also investing money and referenda first thing was like a nonpartisan redistricting commissions who's goal is to do fair maps and not partisan on so I think that's an encouraging sign that we should hold Democrats to that value\n[noise] when it comes to the the division in our politics the polarization um the gridlock do what do you make of that in the sense of of how we got here in in ultimately\nAnd I mean it will always in some way be a part of our politics but I I guess I I I Do wonder of irreparable\nDamage that has been done to this idea of democracy\nWell it's very I mean experts who really study this stuff closely disagreed pretty vehement about themselves so I guess what I Would say is the who the people that I I I I'm\nSite in the book talking about polarization essentially talk about two things one is that you're seeing a sorting of the two parties voters along racial and cultural lines which is a potentially troubling development because it means more polarization going forward\nThe second is the rise of negative partisanship in which people's political choices and preferences are shaped\nAt least as much or more so by dislike of the opposition then I'm like of one's own side so those are very problematic trends potentially and\nIt's hard to know where they'll end up but what I Try to argue in the book is if is that if we can try to improve some of these institutional process seas so that people come away that well the sense that\nThat they're fair then potentially that could mitigate the damage [noise] um\nDo you think but going back and ... and I'm Sorry for being hung up on this but when I when we talk about and as you say people are are very divided on the subject and I understand because we just don't know but\nI mean we've never seen anything quite like this before have we I mean these norms of the norms of politics which is part of the reason that he that a President Trump was elected in the first place these norms of politics have been had been shot the hell are some people were thrilled about an

[laughter] I mean I I don't I to me I I don't want to I think we can I think we can improve things incrementally and an marginal ways I I think if you make it easier for people to vote if you\nIf you remove sort of take off the table these these um weapons of procedural warfare or that are mostly wielded by Republicans I think things could get better\nBut we're seeing this right now in the midterms where people have I mean we don't know what's going to happen in two weeks we have no idea but we we sure don't\nWe don't and and we if we believe one poll I mean if if anything that we got out of two to twenty sixteen is okay but let's be a little wary of polls but the the um ... and certainly don't get cocky but by the same token I mean now is the opportunity as you say I'm for people to mobilize let's say that doesn't\nHappen let's say that does not go in a democratic way um then then\nHow much further does it have to go for it it turns or are we definitely being told something that OK maybe this whatever this is this thunder dome politics is a better way\nWell look I I I Would agree that if if Republicans hold on to both houses of Congress I I think things could get worse from from a purely from a small D democratic prospective\nSo for instance I think we all know that a President Trump is going to probably fire attorney general sessions after the midterms right and try to replace them with the loyalist who will constrain our potentially shut down the Robert Mueller investigation or barring that maybe\nPotentially try to act to prevent Mueller's findings will come coming out which the attorney general could do if he did not recused himself toy sessions has signed by the way I don't think Trump's choice of attorney general will or recused himself so\nUm that's a real problem and then if there's a Republican is Republicans when hold on to the house\nI Would think Trump will feel quite embolden to go through something like this and in the secure and the knowledge that House Republicans won't do anything about it and those House Republicans will also feel emboldened not to do anything about it by winning so I think things could get worse for sure\nWell the book is fascinating it's called an an civil war taking her democracy and an age of ... this information and thunder dome politics Greg sergeant thank you for being with us\nThank you so

WAMC that works last round table there is linked\nAnd so I have I have looked at this and ... them correct me if I'm wrong please do [laughter]\nI bet that is a and that's because ah the the button that used to be at the bottom has now vanished so that has now taken so the actual size of the phone is just a little bit smaller and yet it's all scream\nAt yes because frame around based right what we call the frame around the screen is gone and what that means is that what has been made smaller\nIs everything except the screen okay and to me that's that's an important [noise] it just feels like some kind of inflection point to is is that to fans say\nNo no I think I like that that's a that's a public radio word\nYeah [laughter] from and and and\nSo that what we're doing is actually what you care about which is at the screen is bigger because the rest of the ... of the phone has been made smaller\nWith the exception I think the battery which also is because the screen because it's bigger requires more power so I think the battery is a little bit bigger but we don't see that\nNo I don't I don't want to skip ahead too much but but this is also\nUm but we are seeing these costs models to where it's where there's the the normal phones and then there are these plus size phones that that are almost tablet like there's sort of the intermediary between a phone and a tablet right\n[noise] yeah and ... whether I'm whether they're intermediate between ... and tablet is something that ah\nIt's up to individual yeah terminology but the plus came out I think came with the um the success plus\nMhm and but so that's sort of yesterday's news because what apple pulled this time is a cause no us\nWhat they told [noise] that well that's another technical term [laughter] when they got away

communication that this this has to do with both phones and and tablets right I mean we're basically what we're seeing happening with phones were seeing happening with tablets as well\nYes and apple has announced a media event for next week\nWhich is of course they don't say what they're going to interrupt but it's widely assumed that it will be this will be I pat stuff and perhaps a Mac or to a and the same technology that let them shrink the size of\nThe device relative to the screen size will happen probably on the path\nOkay so for you I I asked this question for you as a developer I asked this question for you as a user I asked this question for us as humanity in general too big our audience\nI Know um why I tried to be included [noise] why is that important in the sense of\n... in these in these sizes are obviously resolution knows better right we can see things better um there are we assume that with each generation the product and the technology in the technology increases in the product becomes better in some way than the last one\nThat's that's the hope\nYes so how does it change our life\nYou can see more on a bigger screen with higher resolution ... and the two parts to that we as developers can put more things on the screen\nBecause you can now read smaller type\nAnd if you look at interfaces I'm going back to you can just look at a advertisements looking back at interfaces software going back\nTo PCs yeah you can see that the trend has been higher resolution and better images so that we can put more on the screen and we can read smaller sized objects the size of text on basic screens\nCan be reduced because the clarity is greater and\nRecognize the the fact that not everyone can see even though the resolution is quite clear not everyone can see them we now have controls we've had for a number of years on most of the devices where you can change the relative size with kind of slider circuits had one everything bigger course now\nBut I Do that so it's so that's where we're going but the fact that the facts that we've got this change with\nThe hardware side really hardware is what's driving this that lead such but more clear information on the screen with out enlarging the size of the device itself in many cases that's exciting\nI think you and I have talked about this film yes was question again and with without it seem like I'm causing trouble because I'm really not trying to cause trouble\nI've only tried this is live radio [laughter] I'm only try no certainly not try to ... you [laughter] I'm just I just just a question that I have and I'm Wondering whether this is how this\nPlays out but but these let's take apple for example\nWhen when they when they do\nThis when they come out with these with these things is it a reflection of what we users want and I've asked for\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no poll Doug harness in that did to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nBoth and other things too okay uh we go back to the statement credited to Steve Jobs for the number of people also said that you can't ask people what they want in your devices\nBecause they don't know because the devices haven't been made yet Mm So that's a ... and we see and we see that I I'm just following a somewhere in the region a downtown revitalization project which is built on not to\nIs the same principle and they're very different field I'm asking people what they want the new downtown to look like\nAnd that to my mind doesn't give really terrific results because people describe existing downtown ... rather than new downtowns\nSo it's the same thing whether you're talking about downtown revitalization or technology or it's hard for people to say we want something that doesn't exist does that make sense it\nDoes make sense although I Do wonder about things like um and maybe this was a very super ... a superficial thing but for example although we don't like I don't remember ever voting on the fact that I don't want a headphone Jack anymore\n[laughter] I I think [laughter] I never I never got to vote on that [noise]\nWell I'm Sorry yeah but I have other things\n... ... if someone can look at the advantages and disadvantages headphone jacks and what the shape of them is which kinds of devices work with them and if someone can say sometimes people will say or vendors will say we're going to change this so that you have something new right\nThat now I'm not\nSome people would say that sort of what happens in the world of fashion sure because it's obviously you're wearing last year's right whatever or we think that that's but in the technology world we were hoping that\nIt's a tradeoff between saying okay if we changed this\nDevice connector\nWe will then be able to do such and such that we can't do now I'm so that's\nThat's how things like that can happen I'm not saying that does happen but I think most of the time it's a trade off if we make this particular change we can do that particular thing that we think will improve the user experience\nAnd and then you you get used to it right and\nAnd then you complain if it says changed back or something or changed again\nRight and and I guess we're always going to complain I I I think just in general people are real good with change especially with something that they they use as as intimately as they do their devices for\nAnd why does and I I I Hope this doesn't irritate people but sometimes the trade off between making a change to a visible part of the products like the cable or connector yeah and what it can do\nMay require to make that decision requires talking about the disconnect who's going to change of going to have to buy a new cable or something and that has\nStreaming support for WAMC come from
