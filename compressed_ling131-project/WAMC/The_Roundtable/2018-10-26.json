are rightfully so um to get all of this in a New York city police department was alerted\nBy a to a suspicious package it was dressed a former director of national intelligence James Clapper and again CNN and um so the ... that is a brings us up to twelve a packages\nHave been sent\nWe know a little bit more than we knew what was the last time we talked about the story many of these packages are believed to have come from a facility to be mailed in a facility or outside of Miami\nAnd though hum and it just leave it more were mailed hum and perhaps all were mailed but that is still to be completely determined there was some reporting early on in the investigation that some of these packages were\nDelivered by hand it now appears that most if not all did actually go through the mail 'em and\nThey just were delivered by hand now appears that most if not all did actually go through the mail um and ah as\nFor all of this as this continues of course I'm not with this last too but uh the ... the president has continued uh yesterday um and has stepped up his attacks on a blaming this on the media for causing the toxic atmosphere\nThat would allow this type of behavior and uh the mood in the country and I'm not taking any personal responsibility but certainly um blaming the media for their role in this so let me go around the room and Allen you on first\nCrack yes Joe could I have just one moment to get myself into real trouble\nOh great Oh yes oh God I didn't make time for that I'll go ahead\nYeah I Do I Do want to say something we got a lot of mail yesterday I I was disappointed in it or about ... children\nAre being on our air and people saying things like get a real conservative or how he you know say good things about Trump look I don't take second place to anybody in terms of saying a\nOf being critical of the current president of the United states who I consider to be one of the greatest crisis in history and who might be leading us into what I Would only considered to be a fishes stick state and his attacks on a press or ... of of of that\nAnd yet I Do want to appeal to everybody to say\nHey folks come on now\nAh is is this is what this radio stations dedicated to\nAnd if ... is willing to come on occasionally and it's only occasionally\nA and say things that are have foreign to many of us he would go more if people weren't so I mean that that's right [laughter] that's right [laughter] I guess a lot of hey hey who are we we're not fascists we've got people who say we only want\nOne side of a of the situation\nUm we are we are a radio station that is pretty dedicated to to prove that the truth bringing and talking to the power and I just want to appeal to everybody the Sixers things through\nBecause of we really do need to we really do need to to keep this into perspective and that's all I Want to say on\nOne of those are the problem that we're I mean I think it's it's a lot of what we're talking about here in this case of a of our national discourse following these these bombs being sound of such division in the country and and even I mean yes we can we can point to the right we can point to the left but\nIn this case you you simply bring in I'm a conservative voice which we wish we had been asked to do and and we want to do obviously\nUm and uh and the the I I think one of the things I wanted I talked about this on the phone last night but I'm like a letter doesn't you know the okay\nFine but the the tenor of the male was disturbing it really was it was it was I mean not not as as though it was threatening but it it was that there is no place for that type of\nOf conversation or disc or Israel and I think that as bad as it it it it I think it it it it ... the reality right now is that we as Americans need to take a timeout engaged in a lot of self reflection\nIt doesn't matter uh that that your your on the left but what you're what you're preaching right isn't tolerance it doesn't it's as bad on the left as it is on the right now during the\n... it's not as bad on the left as it is on the right okay what I'm saying to you there\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nAct regardless of of all of the good that you do on a day to day basis because\nPeople are watching some atrocious acts that that that that occurred in places in our society and right now is the moment where if if we're going to be first and foremost Americans it it means we come to a table and we start talking to one another again and rich rich happens to be one of my favorite people\nHis his his energy is positive energy is so infectious and\nThe one thing that I truly enjoy when he's on the air\nIt is I Love seeing the perspective that he's coming from and trying to figure out do ah where'd you get that what are you watching what er yeah and it's and it's important\nWell I Want to speak on behalf I think of all of us with the exception of Christ and we don't know I Know you've never met ridge happier than I Am I'm choosing north of the wall Street Journal north of the wall and apparently she got in a caravan [laughter] we're not gardening or the wall [laughter] but\nUm I think I speak for everyone in this room including Alan that uh you know rich besides yes even conservative but he's also one of the nicest guys memorial we we love him has been a part of our program for like Twenty years\nUh and uh we we just we have great respect and I would say also he has great respect for all of us he he enjoys being part of these conversations [noise]\nUm and I I don't want to make this about us but it is it is interesting and I think you're absolutely right there but it is interesting that that um you know just because there is a point of view that as expressed that may not be yours that we're we're just going to shut down and say that has no place for me like I Can't tolerate listening to it is yeah\nCool and there are a lot of people who feel that way oh yeah I'm a little ... look this is a very frustrating situation I think tutors makes the point I'm this is a terrible man Trump is terrible man he is\nAnd um and uh you know I mean what can I say except that if somebody comes on and make an argument\nOr we have to live in the argument we can reject it I think Judith as I Know I Do ah we we we can fight with him we could argue with him but that's what this country should be not a country which says there's no place says she'll just sit at the table for you\nAnd and also listen to him um I mean I gave rich a lot of credit for showing up and I think you know when I worked in the government I often urge my colleagues to listen with the intent to here\nUm I I'm kind of fascinated by Trump supporters especially when they can get past the Fox news talking points for him I Want to understand and I'm\n... because it's just unfathomable that's like you know that that these policies just keep getting worse and worse I'm I'm In the camp of just when you think you can't get any worse that does that answer on him snowball yeah we've seen that this week but\nYou know quite honestly I think the change comes from us what we can do in our communities what we can do is advocates elected officials in\nTo to be responsible Americans these days involves listening to all all viewpoints and then making a judgment and acting in a non violent principled way and David that listen to a point in terms of left and right um\nI I think what we see unfolding this week is it's hard not to believe that this is inspired by a president who um is is inflaming thing\nTo believe that this is inspired by a president who um is is inflaming things we we we count on our presidents to be unifying voices in moments like this\nAnd we have a president who seems determined to make to make the division worse\nYes I can I just ask I I Love what you just said ... who is gift um how much how much theater she sees in um in Donald Trump how much\nOf it [laughter] [laughter]\nAbout it but I Know I was like\nJust launched me in their Alan thanks a lot and ah well I guess I have a unique perspective because I can look at it as a Canadian as the daughter of Dutch immigrants who showed up in Canada after the war with you know forty bucks in their pocket\nOr at the new citizen of America and as an artist so I sort of get to look at that from a lot of different perspectives an actually had a lot of really fascinating conversations with\nRepublican so I get to feel a little safer chatting to me\nKnowing that I'm Canadian and and to to David's point and Jews point having all these conversations with people where everybody really is trying to listen to each other the the rational people I hear my friend's talking about being in taxis\nWhere those perspectives are coming from and I'm having as many conversations with Republicans as we're stacking would in my garage a week ago you know about why they didn't vote why they're going to vote this time and all of that stuff\n[laughter]\nYou know I think it's really it's been important for me to think about framing things in the values and understanding that just as strongly as I feel about the liberal values the conservative feel justice strongly about the other values and I need to have respect for that\nBut I think we have to oh I'm Sorry 'cause you know I started roles but [noise] yeah do you do but Trump Trump is a very bad then\n[laughter] but you know but if you listen to a lot of Republicans are grown but if you listen to rich she doesn't always support with Trump is doing you're saying yeah you know what I mean immigration reform and I don't really agree with Trump's approach to it\nYet Aaron Aaron yesterday he did [laughter] let's face it he did\nWell above all Republican known Trump no no and that's exactly the point you're making exactly the right point\nThis is a very bad than he is not a ... in my mind he is president and he got himself elected president one way or the other\n... theater man yet yeah but the truth of the matter is he self serving he he he he gets tougher himself as opposed to\nIf it for the conservative principles he ran for I think there's a big difference between genuine conservatives and Trump I think Trump the bad man\nAnd I'm and I'm going to ... I said I'm going to continue to say\nYeah I I agree Allen I think Trump is a bad man a sad thing to say about our elected president and I've\nCome to the conclusion that rather than him being a policy expert rather than him even being an ideologue I think just on a personal level to your issue of performance\nI think Trump needs to win every media cycle he needs to be dominant even if he is portrayed in a negative light\nAnd we're in such a perilous time because if he's not front page\nOf the New York post and the New York daily news we'll do something to get on the front page and the way you get on the front pages by saying and doing more outrageous thing I Am literally degree and we're in this cycle like how does this end he's he's at some commentators have said he wants to be the bride at every wedding\nThe baby at every critic hunting and it's all about him and it's just bringing us in the\nBizarro direction that is not we've never been here and politically\nHe's but but we reward him for for that Donald Trump you can we can continue to focus on on Donald Trump demand the president the problem that I have is continuing to focus on the on those issues at home we should be focusing on ourselves the body politic\nWhy that is very virulent strain\nThis this person how was he able to capitalize you need a right now and and you know he's been rewarded for his behavior his his recent small bump\nIn his approval ratings just because he continues to drag a he continues to drag us into this uh this space about values right whenever we're talking about his policies whether it's the children in the in the families at the border\nSpace about values right whenever we're talking about his policies whether it's the children in in the in the families at the border\nYou know he can't win any of those argument right right so he has to just jump in front of a camera and continue to talk about an F. L. players he she divides us amongst race he divided along all of these other you know values and that's the thing that we have to stop fighting on right\nWell because the the theater distracts from the policy we say fair to the theater distract from the city of ... [laughter] um [laughter] so you know yes him being on the front page of the New York post saying these outrageous things really distracts\nFrom some of the most important thing which is are the policies that he's recommending he called the Federal Reserve loco and crazy um I mean\nWho am I now have I mean this is about the Federal Reserve\n[laughter] sorry [laughter] people that's what we're trying to I mean at at our more simple people will get drawn to the simple headlines and they want to look at the horrible murder that happened and that's kind of what we're drawn to looking at it he understands that\nOne hour while I learned from Alan about this years ago of of when it comes to politics is you know the we we tend to go to the things that we understand and and the and that's what he's so good at his is bringing us to the very well days of of of things that we get out of what makes people happy or adults\nTo that point in what David mentioned earlier on last night Howard Dean spoke at sending in college I went over and and listen to because I'm just looking for wisdom anywhere he talked a lot about early ... child stuck and I I'm afraid I Can't remember the name of it right\nNow I Will tell you because I think one of my favorite books of all time we've had her on twice um it's amazing and\nAnd one of the premise is is that in a reason why so many people voted for Trump\nPresident Trump is because um [noise] for for many Americans who are not doing well economically they believe that they're waiting their turn and as they get older and they build up resources they'll do better\nThey now see people cutting in line ahead of them namely women in the workforce too bad um immigrants um somehow this extends to I'm\nA LB chi chi cutie people you know why that is kind of your mind I don't know but I it's kind of a feeling that people are people are are taking away their ability for economic prosperity\nYeah early I'm Sorry it's early ... strangers in our own landing Iyengar and morning on the American right and not to give a plug but the way we have a ... where we we have an interview a true and emotionally with her both before and after the election that we did um because it is a stunning\nBook ... AMC we I don't know what to look at it um [noise] yes who's going to\nGoing to be you know I think he does exactly right because um\nYou know for the average middle and upper middle class family there you know inflation adjusted income has been stagnant since the Nineteen seventies that's as much of a result of Republican as it is democratic policy\nIt's stacked deck and after decades of declining mobility for a lot of people most people are sliding down the income ladder\nUm you know it was Bill Clinton who passed permanent normal trading relations with China was Bill Clinton who um divides NAFTA all of these programs put us workers in direct competition with foreign workers\nAnd provided exceptional protection for investor rights but said nothing about labor or environmental um regulations so [noise]\nAnd provided exceptional protection for investor rights but said nothing about labor or environmental um regulations so I understand why people I I understand I understand Trump's appeal to people given what has happened economically\nOver the past you know three or four decades and it really comes down to inequality and that the economy has been\nHijacked by the top one percent and I know that's kind of a of a drum beat and a lot but it's true and whether it's the Koch brothers or whether it's um you know the CEO of Goldman Sachs are very very short order Jamie\nDiamond from J. P. Morgan\nBut what are the deck is stacked up voters truly frustrating is what is so extremely frustrating is that people who have the most to lose continue to vote against the self interest I write and and there's a failure right to\nUnderstanding grasp the issues that are being you know discussed legislation that young past\nThere almost ... there are willing to accept you know the the the talking points\nOf the conservative right there is no way if human beings of every American actually understood or or understood the issues that are being discussed there's no way that you'd ever have the Congress that we have right now that you'd have the president that we have right now you were talking about you're talking about NAFTA right\nAnd the fact that Bill Clinton left out anything that has to do with with with organized with labor and wages and left in anything that has to do with the environment well what are the two issues right that you'll never get support from a with a conservative or Republican you know government ... those are two of the issues right and so\nHow it is the people the working class the ... the working class people of these red states continue to vote\nFor the party that will protect those interests that won't advocate for those interest is dumped them\nThey're voting their aspirations instead of their material situation\nI don't know if they're voting their aspirations because\nI who's spy when they're talking about the Dow Jones\nWhen they're talking about you know the one percent tax breaks that were just being passed\nLike who really believe that this was going to impact on them what they did was they fell for\nThe stunt the theater of having companies and corporations\nYou know hand out a thousand dollar bonus here the thousand dollar bonus there and it was being done it's like all of a sudden that whole week it was like all these companies coming forward we're going to give a workers the bonuses like uh but you didn't talk about giving them a permanent increase in their ...\nJust because I have it and that was like shared with you which is from Janet who says could you please comment about the ocean policy from Trump but as opposed to address the ocean to breed and plastic in the ocean\nYeah it's very limited I'm the president signed a bill two weeks ago mostly pointing fingers at other countries\nUh and it is a greater problem and in Asia than it is in the United states but it's a little bit more money to nobody for their marine debris program I mean it's fine it's not going to do any damage but it's not\nNearly that response that we need to deal with the growing crisis of plastics in the ocean estimates are by twenty twenty five for every three fish in the ocean that will be one pound of plastic ...

continued to use a cell phone despite warnings from aids of the calls on it or not secure and by the way these calls include calls to Fox News to various leaders around the world to relatives\nAnd there you go you have the Nixon tapes were pretty boring too right [laughter]\nWell in terms of Russia and listening and you're cutting out the middleman ... making a lot easier\nYou remember the old days when you have the mobile phones and you're just like hear it on your you could hear as we'd\nKnow yeah [laughter] oh that's\nWhat's going on in Washington I mean is this ... this is actually a very serious problem say but I'll tell you who is listening\nKind of what's going on in Washington I mean is this ... this is actually a very serious problem\nSay but I'll tell you who is listening

the ... were just so we know what it was you are are are ... that was covering covering traveling well that's right okay um now uh we have ah let me say I want to go to\nThe point of a call log is before we go to the next one that we're not even gonna you know hear about all the calls that are being made they made such a big point in the New York times article that we released the call log every morning but who cares if we're not seeing all the calls\nIts lanes let me tell you the president remember your ... choir and to maintain\nTheir record of the call and also all great correspondence and you remember a few months ago we saw pictures of whenever the president has paper on his desk he ripped it in ... in a poor aid has to go and um tape it hacked I gather said they're playing with their records retention act\n[noise] but of course somebody on the official taper\nSet a former bureaucrat who's really into the record retention act it's actually very important that is

the president says that he's taking revolutionary action he was busy yesterday no question about a busy uh says he's taking revolutionary taken all the points action to a lower drug prices took his most significant action yet are saying is ministry Asian is moving to stop\nGlobal free loading\nBy foreign nations when it comes to the right into that Americans pay for prescription drugs the announcement as a side that the president and his aides are shifting their focus to healthcare two weeks before the midterm elections in his speech Thursday Afternoon at the department of health and Human Services\nTrump said as a minister Asian would be taking the revolutionary step of allowing Medicare to directly negotiate prices with\nDrug companies that he says have rigged the system waiting to us patients paying more for their medicine is\nGood so the next step is Medicare for all then right I Know if if he's going down this path and why not just [noise] have single payer health care in Michigan if he wants to be revolutionary here's this chance\nTo go to Jay Frog right it's Michigan Jay Frog with a top had coming out singing because\nHe may be hell on my mood and then all of a sudden when there's when someone's watching it's like ... you know he's when he's right back to a friday the ... oh yeah I Do yeah yeah but it ... my point is the other day he's talking about tax cuts for middle class when when Congress was in session right\nSo it's like it's it's such desperation to try to to gin up turn out for a for for the house\nRight but but if if this is real and I know it's not but if it's real this is a good policy this is something we will on it for years in\nExcept you know it's not real because\nAnd I know it's not but if it's real this is a good policy this is something we will on it for years in\nExcept you know it's not real because he's not real about anything he talks about\nRight but it's half donkey a lot of say what a donkey really is it's half donkey that I'm\nIn a big big bud earlier but yet they haven't done that but because\nHe doesn't go away what he does he says we want to play pay what the Europeans are paying a under this thing but he doesn't talk about our negotiations with the direct negotiations with the drug companies which are strictly prohibited as they say in the theater before they turn ...\nYou know the remind U.S Russia you know for the Republican Party has been banging the free trade drum for I don't know since the end of World War two that\nOne of the areas in which the U.S has the least free trade has to do with a prescription pharmaceuticals there's heavy protection for um\nIntellectual property a mental justified in the research and development ah argument that the um a pharmaceutical companies have but sure if Republicans want to have free trade let's have free trade and medical services and prescription drugs as well\nWe have about a minute and a half so I'm going to finish up with some letters we got this one from Lucy uses so why isn't the American media was willing to the president and cell phone calls as well as the Russians are Mitch Mitch says love the battle with rich coming into the panel come in and some people calling the Caribbean and Mexico in invasion\nGreat imagery for the future mhm yeah I'm a ... Williams\nWho should we be more scared of Trump himself for those who enable him support him I think you can be scared of everything yeah true I don't think you have to be anything\nIn your ... to the point if Trump does not run or doesn't win a second term how do we put the country back together again with\nWith every everything he has instilled in people I'm I'm a little more nervous actually about\nPeople who are I'm kind of following on the fringe his racism his sexism his homophobic or comments I mean this is long term damage yeah\nAll right we're at a time that we know that [laughter] so it was a happy time when we're in this battle of hum my thanks to everybody\nOr Judith thank you very much a David Aaron always a pleasure Christian great job thank you\nSo much for coming in we were to have been coming by not yet a excellent\nHum and Allen be well thank you very much you're listening to the roundtable on WAMC [noise]\nDebate is starting to attack against attack\nFrom American public media this is marketplace ...

guilty of air dot com has more information\nApple CEO Tim Cook threw down about privacy in the tech industry or what he called the data industrial complex he called for the United states to adopt comprehensive digital privacy regulations\nApple has stressed privacy is a selling point over the past couple of years but this was a big broadside at a couple of the other biggest tech firms in the world namely Facebook and Google\nAnd it's worth noting that it's easy for Apple to privacy when the option it's offering is it closed ecosystem where the company controls every hour\nAnd it's worth noting that it's easy for Apple to tout privacy when the option it's offering is it closed ecosystem where the company controls every aspect of the technology\nLet's dig into this and quality assurance the friday segment where we take a deeper look at a big tech story Tony Robbins attacked policy reporter at the Washington Post he covered cooks remark\nI think Tim Cook is pretty frustrated with Silicon Valley he's certainly not the only one these days\nFor the company though I was able to do this because its business model is so much different than a company like Facebook and Google\nThose two companies rely on collecting data about you and turning that data into insights that can then be sold to advertisers that's how they monetize things with apple it's different we're talking about the sale of iPhones and iPads and knocked the pros so I you know Apple CEO Tim Cook has a bit more of a runway to talk about these things and his peers\nWhat did you think about these comments afterward ... former chief security officer ... he said Tim Cook is being a little hypocritical because the company accommodates Chinese censorship and essentially saying you know nobody's clean when they're making billions of dollars off of selling technology\nGods and even beyond what Alex Amos was pointing out in his tweets from Denver when you're on your iPhone when you're using the search feature they're using Google Search there there's always been an arrangement between\nApple and Google with respect to search for some of the things that can cook is lamenting when he talks about privacy or things that in some ways the iPhone enabled by merging you towards using Google Search in some settings but I think that it speaks to the bigger issue here which is that\nFor many of these companies they're troubles with governments are very complex and they're pretty wide ranging\nShould any tech company be framing the conversation right now especially a conversation about regulation on privacy\nWell whether they should or they shouldn't be framing it they certainly are and that's because the companies don't want to be regulated in a way that affects their ability to collect information and monetize it and many of them are really worried in particular because of what happened in Europe and in California over the better part of the past few years\nMore and more of the national wealth going to fewer and fewer people on and uh the sort of what had been at least partially solidarity has certainly been breaking down a and now it's breaking down even further I think with a devotee politics and I'm In the kind of thing that we saw or that we're seeing daily but right now\nThe point you make in the book is just how expensive the super rich have become and ultimately you believe unsustainable they are the super rich in your opinion are unaffordable so what do we do about that\nWell they they are on affordable because um even get to a point where um none of us are working an anymore and we have to be sustained\nOr by some sort of a program like you know basic income or or or whatever everybody gets a grant or or you have some that just is a social disruptions\nAre there many things that can be done about it and sometimes it's just a matter of ah you know reforming taxes for example or what we've seen a over a number of years is the shedding of taxes the lowering of corporate taxes um sometimes total evasion of corporate taxes\nOut for a period of years something like two thirds of our corporations didn't pay any taxes that are at all or we have examples for example I I always bring up the apple but they're they're hardly unique\nUh but uh they're very good at of aiding taxes um they're uh they're registered in the state of Nevada so they don't pay a state tax there all the other companies actually in Cupertino, California\nI'm much of their uh met me their profits actually go into um their intellectual property a which belongs to a subsidiary which happens to be in Ireland\nUh and of course apple planes actually that it's a virtual company and therefore it doesn't have a tax on but all so they escaped taxes there they pay they they virtually no taxes for their intellectual property rights\nOr we can certainly do a lot better than that uh we also are about to enter up a point of the the recent tax bill that that that Trump was able to get through it simply says that there'll be no more inheritance taxes out to be here twenty twenty four\nWe've already rolled inheritance taxes taxes back quite a bit uh we can do much better there or we could probably use a wealth tax or that it's a very small tax on well above a certain amount a Iceland did it\nUm it was ... at one point five percent a for um income above a one million I'm at a reduced to dispose of Lincoln of millionaires perhaps\nA but at the same time the economy after a four years of this a wealth tax the economy was actually going out of sustained rate of five percent which is quite extraordinary yes license\nKind of me after a four years that has a wealth tax\nThe economy was actually growing at a sustained rate of five percent which is quite extraordinary yes Iceland smaller than not states but it gives you an idea of what can be done or just offering the\nUh the tax structure healthcare a we'd save roughly a half trillion dollars a year or by having a health care system or that the that the Europeans all ready have whether it's single payer or it's not single payer\nOr the Europeans have universal healthcare a but they negotiate drug prices they don't let drug company simply charge what they want\nOr something that drug companies can do um ever since Nineteen eighty basically so you have companies buying a therapy that belong to somebody else and then Jack and the price up\nAs much rally did a from Thirteen dollars for for one dose to seven hundred and fifty dollars for one the ... so reform there I'm certainly I'm a universal healthcare certainly would save us\nI'm a lot of money the on allowing um what's now called a Medicare to actually negotiate a pharmaceutical prices additives not allowed into that that would actually save us fifty billion more dollars\nSo wherever you look there's money ... money or they go super rich simply because they own um particular financial um financial assets speaking speaking of that a financial assets I'm In the United states much more than any other country now\nA a more than forty percent of the national income goes to things like a interest dividends and if you add capital gains\nA then it comes closer to fifty percent that's extraordinary that's more than two times what other countries are doing and that's really rewarding those who sort of have the you know the financial levers and the financial power that's rewarding them significantly\nUh and it's also taking a lot of money out of the economy from from the rest of us another thing that's that that that should be done is and the FCC the securities Exchange Commission should be doing some of this\nUh but uh we shouldn't really allow um uh companies to keep a their profits abroad until they can bring them back here much reduced rate or tax\nUh in doing that um we we simply allow them to do to come very close to the skating taxation altogether and that's a tremendous amount of\nCapital that could be employed a much better I'm right here um and it wasn't always that way I'm used to be that you couldn't differ taxes if they are equipped to protect us on the profits that were held abroad\nSo what what I'm saying is that an almost every single case a law has been passed\nA to enable the one percent or the one tenth of one percent\nOr to extend to extract more grants from the rest of us are pharmaceuticals another really great example uh most of the innovations are that have come about a and drugs actually come about as a result of government research not a private company research\nAnd um after Nineteen eighty though a lot of companies were allowed to take advantage and they were allowed to commercialize or whatever um had been developed in the public sector\nOr by uh by government or by government assisted ah research\nAnd I'm a that that has never does the law initially allowed for a profit sharing\nA it also the basically said that uh there there should be um you know control the prices or the patents are what are the withdrawn a but those provisions have never really been maintained and they've been systematically broken sense in the results\nWhat are the withdrawn a but those provisions have never really been maintained and they've been systematically broken fence and the result is of course a fortune on her strength profit for pharmaceutical companies which are which normally a get a totally your pet\nAnd not only that but they can extend those that simply by challenging a generic producers which will get them individual thirty month where she can you look at and not only that they can then change maybe one small Malik molecule on the original formula for example ... which\nWas a British company that pilots who um [noise]\nUh to

everybody off the original medication which is now available generically\nUm go out to ... which was on her pet and so many many things that can be done uh to either vastly restrict the kinds of rats

blizzard of lived so sick and so fast that it's hard to keep up\nIn this final episode of our series truth and faith will ask about the meaning and the corrosive effect of all of those laws will explore the moral and ethical basis of our faith and democracy in front of summer I some of the lessons learned in these programs\nBut let's start with democracy and truth which happens to be the title of a forthcoming book by sofia Rosenfeld she's a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania her other books include common sense of political history and she joins us from her home in Philadelphia Welcome to the democracy test\nThanks so much for having me on something you argue that the moment I just mention the lie about the size of the crowd on the mall and inauguration day but that marks the transition for Donald Trump from what you call commonsense populism does something much darker\nWhy don't you begin with commonsense populism what do you mean by that\nSure well there is a long tradition in American political life of talking about truth in a sort of the vein and there's always been something I think of a tension between a kind of highbrow insulted rhetoric off and backed up by\n... statistics and claims rooted in science and a vast learning a very kind and no more folksy style that sort of that I Know things when I see them\nAnd claims rooted in science and a advanced learning of various kinds and no more folksy style that sort of says\nI Know things when I see them live a kind of a kitchen table logic that says you know there's no global warming because I went outside today and it was warmer than it was this time last year and in some ways that's a very long tradition in American\nPolitical life and at times I think Trump\nHits that court in an ordinary sort of way using plain language folksy analogies kind of appealing to an every man's style but then there are other moments when that isn't quite the idiom that he draws upon and I think that moment you mentioned about the question about\nThe inaugural crowd says an odd one because to lie about something in which the evidence is so she is a bleak clearly in front of everybody it's just a ... not ally of the cover up but a lie is a kind of\nPolitical strategy of sorts onto itself and what is that strategy\nAnd I think that strategy is to say in some ways the facts don't matter that\nSure sometimes on line sometimes on telling the truth sometimes I'm making it up\nBut I'm not going to follow conventional norms in my speech patterns and authority at the centrally going to reside would in me\nCan become a kind of way to push back to say you know back to that inauguration crowd to say but you know I I looked at the photos and one of them is half empty and that couldn't be the biggest crowd in history and that might seem like it doesn't work into convince anybody in the moment\nBut it's essential that as many people as possible keep doing that\nKeep relentlessly reminding us of the sort of basic facts as a pushback against a world in which it's very hard to tell what what\nIt's impossible to miss how often Trump to most outlandish laws in the mountains of others he says you know a lot of people are saying that ... was born in Kenya that sort of thing is that just an attempt to plausible deniability or is that a specific\nTechnique and that's an interesting question it's a way to keep everybody confused\nSick as much as anything else I think it's that a technique that says how do we know anything everything up for grabs\nSome people are saying that some other people are saying that\nUh he sometimes said I've been hearing you know but without saying from home or with what evidence so it seems to me a whole bunch of rhetorical strategy that all work in the same way which is to say I don't have facts and figures I don't need facts and figures and if I had them they'd be distorted any way you can't really trust\nInto the FBI the center for Disease Control New York times whatever did I go by instinct to and I go by what I'm hearing on the street so to speak but the danger there is that nobody knows anything about anything then\nOther politicians can't help but notice that you appear to be able to campaign fact free and still be elected president these days do you think that's going to be part of the Trump legacy yeah that's that's\nOf course the great worry because Trump didn't create the phenomenon of trumpet unto itself he didn't ... you know drop out of the sky and you won't be around forever either the question is will this\nStyle politics remain and if it does what does it mean for democracy and going forward I think she at the moment\nAll over the world we're seeing that this is a pretty effective technique that in the age of um [noise] the Internet particularly it's very easy to spread untruth in such a way that it's not even clear what the truth in what an untruth anymore populist style at least\nHas taken over in many corners of the world that quite different political traditions so whether this is going to turn out to be is a blip in American history that's certainly possible in the U.S has weathered many crises in the past including of course civil war\nOr whether this is going to be a sort of turning away from this moment of enlightenment inspired idea that the truth I think is very hard to say\nIt and I don't think we're at a point yet in which we can really predict which way the winds are going to blow not only us but in England for instance as well Great Britain there's enormous political division I mean it's just about half the population is\nMoving one direction while the other half of moving the other way\nSo that kind of polarization either suggests we're heading to some sort of real social breakdown or that one sided ultimately going to prevail and what can be a pretty brutal struggle\nYou know it's interesting we think of transformational presidents like Franklin Delano Roosevelt or or Ronald Reagan as the troops out to put during the Trump maybe in the category\nMay be the case I mean he does seem in some way to be breaking from a tradition\nThe troops ought to put during the Trump maybe even a category\nThat may be the case I mean he does seem in some way to be breaking from a tradition or their one can look at policies and say well there's certain amount of continuity would say that George W. Bush years and ah in some areas and the other not and certainly um\nThe Republican Party hasn't been transformed overnight\nBut yet there is something different and I think it explains some of the kind of hysteria you know position and I think it explained the very fact that\nEvery newspaper in the country is now sort of putting on the front page of chronicle of lie of the President's Day after day something that's really hard to imagine in a previous moment in quite the same form such a thing has really shifted beneath us and yeah that might make that might make Trump despite himself in some ways a transformational president\nIs he not simply appealing to the anti intellectual strain that has a long history in this country me at that whole idea of why should you listen to experts why should you listen to egg heads just use your common sense that seems to be something that's been a strain and GOP history since at least Ronald\nReagan absolutely so that's where I see a certain amount of continuity and uh I think in the long history of democratic public life in the U.S most evident but it's true elsewhere to has been a kind of conflict from the beginning between a growing\nA emphasis on expertise and a facts and figures\nAnd knowledge derived from elite to various kinds particularly educational lead but that's often means also economic elites on the one hand and this kind of populist tradition sometimes just as a rhetorical covers sometimes more profoundly put a story about the people being dispossessed of their\nBasic no how an instinctive sense of how things should be and how they are\nAnd Trump vacillates a little between those two registers but I think that the pushback that we might call populist the shorthand comes also from a recent triumph of a more technocratic vision of troops so when Europeans protest against the European Union or\nAmericans complain about politics inside the beltway\nThey're complaining about some of the same things which is a kind of politics that seemed cut off from real people that doesn't ask real people what their concerns are doesn't care about their values and populism says you know so well throw it all out throw out all that um\n... skating euphemistic language all that um highbrow highfalutin a study and get let's get back to what we know\nJust by going about business you know just the the knowledge that comes from experience living in the world\nThere's something of course really hypocritical perhaps you might say about a man like Trump but any other number of political leaders have used that language a court tend themselves to be wealthy educated living right inside that bubble up ... trying to pretend they're sort of regular folks\nBut Trump is sometimes described as kind of a cartoon character version of a regular person it's sort of rich or larger than life but still has the sensibility\nOf the seats and supporters or take ordinary\nPerson allowed to play ball and yet he beats are the same time it's also true that is just\nA little bit richer than everybody yeah\nThanks very much [noise] severe Rosenfeld new\nRichard\nThanks very much [noise]\nSevere Rosenfeld new book is democracy and truth a short history she's the Walter each Annenberg professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania [noise]\nYou can learn more about this program at our website which is true politics and power dot O.

I Believe that all politics ... local politics I\nAnd I think that there is actually some truth to it which is why you see I think in our current moment that if you go from district district as the news has been reporting what you find is that a good number of folks that animated by\nBy issues on on the ground and they seemed to be driven to respond to those issues are on the ground\nThis is not to say and I'll I'll stop my point here but this is not to say that there still isn't a sort of deficit and a serious one\nOr in terms of being properly informed there's no way to get on about the business of engaging seriously with Trump diminished ration and his base and not think\nThat one is dealing with both of the ministries and and the citizenry our constituency that isn't properly informed\nAnd so ah how do we deal with that well the way we deal with that is too I'm In good hard old fashion to vote folks out um and devote other folks in\nThe ... come full circle your idea of civic virtue NF personal virtue that even if you're not following the news and following every twist and turn of what's happening with the administration you need to make choices about who you are and who our societies and make their choices at that\nLevel of your schools in your church and and your civic organizations even if you are not glued to the news every day\nSo two points here the first is yes I think that's absolutely right and the second point which I think is related to the the comment that I made earlier it has to be the case and I have to put it in this and this form has to be the case that one is still open to and willing to ...\nThe case and I have to put it in this in this format has to be the case that one is still open to and willing to listen\nTo contrary information that is to say information opinions that seemed to to bump up against the views that you have\nAnd the moment in which one is no longer interested in looking at\nData opinion attending to views that stand in tension with one's own then we'll we'll be in big trouble and I think that this was one of the the hallmarks right of the of the Trump Administration and in many ways in space\nAnd part of what is so damaging about this if in fact it becomes the hallmark of the citizenry as such as that the very capacity we need\nIn order to be responsive to the grievances the problems we find ourselves confronting the very capacity that we that depend on that doesn't say the openness the ability to listen to the other side the moment in which that that goes away\nThan democracy is a already dead\nIn these dark times what do you worry about the most\nWhat I worry about the most is that um do we may have been wrong and by implication I'm wrong but I don't worry about that in some kind of um of a sort of self preferential private land the sense that I Would I Would rather be right all the time and we we all get things wrong\nI worry about this because work to be the case um but do we got this wrong then it was largely me that the ideal of democracy or places to great of a demand on us to honor it\nAnd it may be that democracy places to great of a demand on us and not merely because of\nThe ideal that it represents but perhaps because it is far too noble\nFor us to attain and and that's that's what I worry about\nAnd what gives you hope\nSo what gives me hope uh again I think comes from John ... but it's not just John do as a whole tradition\nAnd that is the sense in which we as ordinary everyday individuals are not set in stone that we are not\nA fix creatures with a capacity for transformation and for development is some true\nTo who we are as human beings and then in the context of the United states we have actually made that elasticity of plasticity the hallmark the foundation of a democratic society\nAnd if that's the case then it means that who we seem to be and I'll current treatment of our fellows and our current practices of cruelty need not determine who we
