what's the number again ... eight hundred three two three nine to six to is the number anybody else want to weigh in here on anything at all in the last two ... you know I\nI again I think that the those stories need to be read carefully to make it again and when you read when I read the story I'm looking for um someone from the nationals to set forth in and verify yet this is what we found\nAnd the question is is this just trying to take the spotlight off Russia or something else happened I think China is a ... can be a bad actor how bad an actor's yet to be determined not hearing from our national security officials that this is as bad as what the vice president saying\nYou know it's so interesting because we get these counter narratives all the time so we get\nThe president of the United states and Russia good good good good\nLooked into his eyes great guy I'm you know putting in all the rest of it and then when you turn the corner you're seeing people lower down in his own administration indicting another dozen Russians so you say well okay you haven't they got the memo or don't these people are speaking one voice the answer's no\nAnd I think that maybe accidentally on

would vote for Kavanaugh in the final votes which I guess might be tomorrow is that what you're telling me\nYeah that that is typically a once this hurdle that we're going to see in less than an hour now\nWants his hurdle is cleared usually that means that the final vote is it done and but it isn't written in stone so there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line and I will say that that like I said is quite rare and we are expecting some people including on you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we date it's one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final vote which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural though today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning\nKelsey I you know I Wonder if you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and\nAnd what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and an all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up which is not normal um that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president on for just about any vote of any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nThere seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they passed an essay but they'll they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on Washington if they can continue to do that or if they fight soured them for more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who is in our studios in Washington Scott ... so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the food we have Grassley I think Diane Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nAnd we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from four key voices in the debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they are they\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAll of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that last remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years correct somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nSo I remember I remember that I remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the Kavanaugh fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling or under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be hurt\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nSexual assault even under the lower standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even more eager than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to wreak corroborate them\nFor the reasons discuss the law I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor couldn't bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard end quote so\nWe have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background\nIn addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who are known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegations that were received\nAre more than twenty committee staff members have work night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leaves and at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by a judge Kavanaugh and these are the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations\nThere also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations\nAre conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever being good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leadership\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nTo judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate\nThere is simply no reason that studied I judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us\nThe Democratic strategy used against a Kevin ... has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair and through the process is\nThirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork or playbook\nRemains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become\nSort of listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare\nTo vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh as being ... which is the way the conservatives refer to this neither Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert books nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how ... fares and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily be confirmed\nA liberal interests did have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money that spent today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of being me\nUm but ... views it turned out he answered the question quite forthrightly he didn't have very strong and he had very strong views and quite as it turned out in the view of many Americans and their senators extreme view and in this\nThis is Northeast Public

resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee were racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation mirror hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination by any means\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics\nObstruction and so called resistance until the final vote\nWas called for a fair wage\nTheir average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for a delay those fell flat\nThere were broach destruction of judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside about Jefferson and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ...\n... women hospital the vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem\nThey all players weren't working\nThe distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination combined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus a pen which we are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts with nothing like the character nothing like the character so it was fair amount of president the old tactics weren't working wasn't going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next on corroborated alibi\nStreaming support for WAMC

shared by Dr Ford and confident with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow mysteriously found its way\nInto the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the committed collected tested all organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI investigation by and embarrassed that are the facts the actual\nFacts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence not not\nWas producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring\nOr from anywhere else nothing\nWell not wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they have been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yeah again\nI Believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children

told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay the telegraph really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has got to Delaware in ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over there let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate\nHas only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and the ruins at art it in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nOr that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench and a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process has generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that I'm a Republican had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevator screeners are paid professionals only looking at only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cab and all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of state but also if he is the key deciding vote in a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nJoining us this vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally the not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex ... has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles in recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nHey Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nYou know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away this is the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think it was looking for something\nTo get them to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap as a lot of the service has shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh on to have a when I think is just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through a political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we're on a months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters\nAre ... and that was a challenge for us going into the ... it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters and be more amped up then the people that are\nKind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats from the Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to fix feed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yet\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because there were probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you termed it for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Northeast Public radio WAMC FM HD Ninety point three Albany\nThere'll be arguing ...

independence promises every American a fair shake created equal\nWhen we fall short on that promise when the system looks rigged we lose our faith and the basic premise that if we work hard and play by the rules will get ahead and that our children's lives will be better than our own\nThere's always been a gap between rich and poor now intention between a broadly based democracy and the power of wealthy elites today that gap it's as big as it's ever been and it helped courage faith in our basic institutions and belief in democratic solutions\nBut we've been here before in the Eighteen nineties the progressive movement a rose to challenge the power of the trust some the robber barons and in the Nineteen thirties and it's the despair of the great depression the new deal transformed the role of government and restored faith and democracy\nLater in the program we'll talk with political historian Lawrence Jacobs from the University of Minnesota about how and why inequality expanded late twentieth century and how that eats away at our institutions and we'll talk about what we learn from history and about democratic solution\nBut we begin with Robert Dallek whose latest presidential biography is Franklin Delano Roosevelt a political life\nRobert Dallek joins us from his home in Washington DC welcome to the democracy test thank you good to be with you and I want to begin with a quote from your prologue which is titled everything to fear you set the date march worth Nineteen thirty three quote\nThe weeks leading up to Franklin Roosevelt induction into the White House we're a nightmare as an unprecedented economic collapse it quieted the cheerleading about America's future that\nBusiness leaders and the press and politicians had made a hallmark of the Nineteen twenties optimism was in short supply voices of despair crowded out the promise of American Life\nIn January Ninety thirty three Calvin Coolidge the retired Republican president said in other periods of depression it has always been possible to see some things that were solid and upon which you could base hope but as I look about\nI now see nothing to give ground for hope nothing of man\nYou go on Herbert Hoover on his last day as president says we're in a pitiful position we are at the end of our strength and Robert Dallek is it fair to say that many were ready to pronounce American democracy a failure\nOr they were and in fact what you have to remember all of us have to remember\nThat this was a time when fascism in Italy not says and in Germany and communism and Russia were competing for this Kennedy later put his hearts and minds of it was the feeling that democracy had reached that's\nThe end of the line and that these other ideologies these although it's just them she government or one more appealing and of course that was the challenge for Franklin Roosevelt to address\nCould he or recreate faith than hope in a a a democratic institutions\nIt the great experiment appear to have run aground on the rocks right at the time\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nEspecially by comparison to the ruins of the American economy exactly FDR promised a new deal for the American people did he have specific coherent alternatives to propose\nWell it was not just the new deal but he said when he came to the Democratic convention in Nineteen thirty two we must be profits the new order\nSuggesting that they were going to be reforms now changes in the way in which the uh the institutions of the country had function in the past than particularly in the recent past\nAnd that they needed to be a resurgence of hope that our institutions could endure could lash or could provide the kind of prosperity and the support\nBecause of course in that sense Pearl Harbor was a godsend to unite the country and bring it into the war as they are a solid failings of a support\nThat does beg the question now how did he hold on to popular support\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nPartners policy did know exceed after some recovery early on FDR cut back on spending and there was another profound slump in the economy I didn't read it out managed to keep American behind him\nWell in fact if they had not\nIn World War two if the warhead dumped broken out Nineteen thirty nine I don't think Roosevelt would have been able to win a third term\nBecause in his second term when as you just described the country\nHad that recession and a a Roosevelt Nineteen thirty eight\nTried to defeat conservatives and the Democratic party in the primary elections specially across the south and he uh the fell short and\nAll but one instance in fighting the conservatives in his party and I don't think he ever could have gotten the nomination again and certainly not the winner third term\nSo it was a war that really in a sense gave him a second opportunity and the country rallied around him and of course the fact that we ended up winning the war brings him down to rush through history as one of the three great presidents of American history\nYou said earlier that Roosevelt didn't end the depression relieved that in fact the war mobilization\nEnded the effort or your biography does not shy away from Franklin Roosevelt mistakes or from his failure to take in Jewish refugees from his failure to address racial issues more forcefully\nHis decision to what turned Japanese Americans in the second World War given all of that and more you still argue that his legacy is one of greatness\nWell it is because he was a brilliant leader in that he used radio to reach people in the grassroots so to speak\nAnd if you look at the polling data\nThroughout his presidency\nAt least in the Gallup polls he'd never went below fifty percent and see what a contrast that is to the current incumbent which never achieved fifty percent in his going on two years in the White House you see\nNow it speaks to ... ... as a politician and\nYes there were stumbles shortcomings they were limitations but again he reflected the public mood in the country when you know he didn't press the case energetically to rescue Jews and olive cost\nHe was reflecting the mood in the country\nWhich was very much anti immigration there was a lot of feeling that at the end of the war the country was going to get back into a recession or depression and that bringing in lots of immigrants would add to the unemployment rolls\nAnd so Roosevelt was very reluctant to challenge that outlook that sentiment you see\nAnd also as late as Nineteen forty four people in the country we were asked if they believed that the Nazis were systematically\nKilling Jews in concentration camps and something like sixty percent of the poll said they didn't believe that they thought it was one time propaganda from the British which had joined us into World War one and so they were very skeptical of that\nGoing to go back to something you said before\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nToo that pushed out into the creation of the liberal state the new deal state yes are you saying that we might not have had that state if it had not been for World War two\nWell it is certainly allowed Roseville preserve it\nBut I think that there were things that he had already put in place like Social Security you'll see an approval in Nineteen thirty five ... through the Wagner Act for a labor unions\nLegitimize them and I don't think those would have disappeared because you'll see once you get things like Social Security and more recently Medicare or look how difficult it's been\nTo overturn the Affordable CARE Act that President Obama put in place to see\nWell here's the next question then behind that what it changed how it's American society how American democracy different in Nineteen forty five then it had been in Nineteen thirty to write an FDR done or how it American Made such a profound change\nIt was it was a permanent change that this sort of notion that you were going to have some kind of ... involvement of the federal government in the national economy in of providing a bedrock of support\nFor people who are less fortunate than the ... society\nThat these had become accepted proposition ... of the society\nAnd that they're not going to be repealed you know Social Security and Medicare I don't think they're ever going to go away as long as we have a democracy in the Democratic voting with a small D in this country\nBecause these are institutions that strike resident in ... with people\nYou see the new deal humid lived the American industrial system\nAnd lots of things that Lyndon Johnson did added to that and the Affordable CARE Act\nObama added to that\nAnd so people don't want that to go away yes there is a certain conservative impulse in the country and they still have faith in a a self help in the notion of ...\nPeople increasing their prosperity and having a better life they have children these are still central propositions I think of American society and of the American ...\nSo I don't think this material will go away it was very much a change in the twentieth century than industrialized

prospering more than the fight middle class this was the arrow in automobile production exploded America built the interstate highway system a housing boom created vast tracts\nOf new homes in New

about economic inequality he joins us from the studios at Minnesota Public Radio Welcome good to be with you\nAnd two thirds of the country are so sitting out midterm elections and even larger numbers sitting out local elections and then you've got the people in power making decisions that are really quite extreme\nThese are not the kind of Nineteen sixties or Nineteen seventies moderate politicians these are people once they're in power they're going for it\nAnd if they don't they know that they will be replaced then the next primary\nThe sense of moderation response of this responsibility to the majority of Americans has disappeared\nAmong our political elites those who are in office or are closely connected to the process that elects officials there's been a major break down and the norms and the behavior of our political leaders today it's about go as far as you can as fast as you can\nVersus the pattern before the Nineteen seventies which was a bit more cautious and emphasize building coalitions and finding where the majority of Americans were at least on selling top of the agenda issues\nWhich brings us back full circle to where we started which is your correlation of people's faith in the government with the Democratic process\nAnd that brings us to a point where we have opinion polls that show the policies that would reduce inequality you know higher minimum wage for example whole show those are broadly popular but those have enormous difficulties getting enacted ... is that the result of this polarization of the political parties that using\nAbsolutely I think one of the biggest signs one of the most significant vital signs of a democracy is whether those in office\nListen to what the majority prefer\nAnd America we're in a dangerous on again and again on the major policies facing our country particularly those affecting the economic well being of Americans you find majorities of Americans supporting those policies whether it's health care reform minimum wage\nAnd others and then you find a political class in Washington and our state government that are on moved they don't seem to be motivated to respond to what most Americans prefer instead\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot

to address the deep and growing economic inequality is with America\nIs well known we don't need a study for it the problem is that our political process is paralyzed and has been unable to respond to the transformation of our economy\nThat is driving the upper classes even higher and stagnating are pushing down just about everybody else that America\nI'm actually an optimistic person by nature but I'm also someone who follows\nResearch and data and I find this moment in American politics to be very sobering this is a hard period for me as someone who studies politics and public policy to be optimistic we're really at each other's throats\nBut here's something that I find interesting\nWhich is when you leave Washington state capitals and you go out and you spend time with people in the country\nThere's some things that are developing that I find quite interesting I see a lot of energy\nParticularly among young people and folks who maybe have not been part of the political process I see a lot of communities coming together and looking for solutions because they know they can't trust Washington state capitals\nI'm also encouraged that even over these policies that are so polarized like health reform we see movement if you look carefully\nI've been doing a study with a colleague at Cornell University Suzanne Mettler and we've been tracking a group of Americans since twenty ten when the Affordable CARE Act was passed\nAnd when we started it was what you'd expect our group of Americans representative of the country were very divided along party lines\nBut now that we're moving into the eighth or ninth year of the four double CARE Act we're starting to see real movement\nWhere Republicans would favor repeal are now saying well maybe this is not such a bad idea let's see if we can improve it\nWe're starting to see greater support for some of the very concrete provisions like protections against preexisting condition exclusions or expanded Medicaid coverage or subsidies or benefits for seniors and as some of those partisan divisions of gun to break down\nWe're also starting to see an uptick in political advocacy that sense that the government responds to me and said I've got the capacity\nTo influence government to me that's a hopeful sign and it goes against the grain of our political process the question is will our elected leaders lesson\nThank you very much for being with us here today Larry yeah pleasure this is Lawrence Jacobs at the University of Minnesota his books include class war what Americans really think about economic inequality which he wrote with Benjamin page [noise]\nTo ask you about this you just finished a book about the tension between democracy and oligarchy through American history I Wonder whether what some see as
