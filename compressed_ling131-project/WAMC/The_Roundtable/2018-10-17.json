R. G. panel\nAt WAMC dot org panel at WAMC dot O. R. G. the same rules of why as always keep your letters short and to the point and on the topic I don't include wings or because we can't collect the money they're obviously um and it just because we're all in kind of a ... mood after the fund drive\nThings are because we can click the mommy there obviously um and it just because we're all in kind of a ... mood after the fund drive\nAlthough this was always the case just don't use abbreviations inappropriate so we know actually what you're saying and if it sounds like I'm trying you I'm not I'm just I'm making sure that we uh we have a smooth transition here and also um you know keep them short end to the point and we'll be able to get to you this morning so\nUh we're getting Malcolm dance on the phone right now and he will be joining us from Los Angeles I Believe it he's on the west coast I don't know exactly what cities and but what he tells you to have to kill ya\nYeah [laughter] that's right he is a former spot after all [laughter] ah but ah what is this getting him on the phone so we'll be with him and just a second so let me take this story I Want to talk about the show the story\nAnd we're talking about that with a with a un I'm a Malcolm in just a second but Allen so let's start with this one which is the president says\nHe was talking to the Associated Press who said it's not my fault of the GOP loses the house if the GOP was the house it's their fault it ain't my fault\nYou know what Joe after a while you begin to understand how this guy works and what he's saying\nIf he thought that his people that that the Republicans could keep the house he would say to you or we're going to keep the house this is all a bunch of nonsense who would give you that positive spin on it did he\nWould be responsible for keeping it and you as you may remember Joe he was running all around the country [noise] campaigning for Republican candidates\nWell the way it's looking now is that um the analysts and you know the analysts were saying Trump would lose the last two so you don't really know but the analysts are saying that the house is gonna flip democratic [noise]\nBut I don't trust those analysts but what because I think in the end it's all it's all about who comes out to vote you know next Saturday at two o'clock I'm going to be the ... community college for Ali uh doing a an analysis of this coming election\nAnd I've been thinking about what I Want to say in what'd you don't know who's going to turn out so for example in Texas there are an awful lot of analysts who are writing off or you know whatever ... Reichs thank you [noise]\nAnd um we have to help each other out today are more mushy will you have to help me more than I have to help you out there that much right now so um so so but but what happened in\nQueens and when you see 'em you know a a a long term congressman who couldn't lose losing that just doesn't count the people who the pollsters ordinarily gets kind of cool not going to come out\nAnd not to mention um look they got it so wrong in two thousand and sixteen and then two years have things changed dramatically and in polling that that are now of course pollsters say they didn't get that wrong but it seems like\nThey didn't they did and not only that we know that we know that they got it wrong a and we know that they continue to get it wrong the one thing that counts is people getting out to vote if they don't vote they're going to get\nA terrible reaction to their own interests so\nYou know in a presidential election fifty percent vote it's terrible in a in a bi election like Xi's twenty percent off and vote but if twenty five percent or thirty percent vote\nNow we see certain indications we see the money coming from the Democrats for the first time really that I can remember the Democrats are squashing Republicans with the amount of money that is coming out but who are they coming from they're coming from small contributors now each of those small contributors goes out\nThat is coming out but who are they coming from they're coming from small contributors now each of those small contributors goes out and vote in this election um that's gonna be the wave that will be the blue way that'll happen that'll mean congressional elections\nOr in in that domain but people if they don't get out and vote\nThen not going to win\nSo the people who are contributing will vote I'm sure uh but I Hope that that's an indication that what's happening here is that people are waking up and saying you're gonna you're gonna get clobbered if you don't vote\n[noise] you know Malcolm Nance has one of our great friends and that he is are we heard a lot of love for him during the fund drive he is a former Arabic speaking naval intelligence counterterrorism and intelligence officer specializing in the middle east a combat veterans survival evasion resistance an ex scape expert\nHe has a historian and the best selling author of the brand new book the plot to destroy democracy how prudent and his spies are undermining America\nAnd dismantling the west and literally\nTwenty two minutes ago I contacted them and said can you be on the show and he is or where are you where are you where are we calling you at\n[noise] um I'm I'm In Los Angeles this I was okay to on\nA nice for what political on what is that\nYes the political scientist at Comic Con of politics and it's huge this year at the Los Angeles and\nUh all the big heavy is they're going to be out here I'm going to make fun of and culture oh great do you get to that one on one with ...\n... well in the gigantic ... you're usually about fifty heavy of their VIPs insecurity and so yeah you can just go right out of the people but uh then it will have to panels and we have discussions about things that are important for the nation\nSo one of the things is important to the nation is what's happening in the midterms Alan and I were just talking to us about this while we were getting you on the phone and that is the president told the you a the a P yesterday that it's not his fault of the Republicans lose control of the midterm this comes just days after\nHe said that uh pretend I'm On the ballot in November So what do you make of that\nWent off if he wants to turn it into a referendum about Donald Trump I I think he's only reading the tea leaves I think that's what's happening now this is why you have so much energy on the side of the left and to a certain extent what's now that people are feeling rather satisfied about the Kavanaugh\n... from ... and you're going to start seeing that energy dissipate on the right ah but you know it's always going to be about Donald Trump whether it was a you know whether it was\nA midterm election or election for dog catcher is large the\nSystem does do bows and uh for the most part I think that this mid term will be one of the most important elections in American history and simply because we're going to be deciding whether we in in a naval a Congress that has\nDecided to surrender their role as a ... of the guardians of the constitution that\nWhether we will you know validate a essentially a person who are out of John Adams called ... you know with a a dictator president ...\nBut Malcolm don't you think are always trying to say it in my posts fund drives stupor don't do think that the fact that he's going around now saying if we lose 'em don't blame me means he knows they're going to lose\n[noise] no I don't believe that at all you know and this is a guy who came against a lot of thoughts and he has this horrible ability to motivate his base through fear and this is what he's trying to say he's trying to get them to believe that you know don't\nMe lay nearly dolls and that sort of you know ... cycle\nWhat he's trying to say he's trying to get them to believe that you know don't me lame yourself and that sort of you know psychological call works for his base but he's bases median age is fifty four years old like outrage right\nA button instead of the some of the year you're still young but the younger voters who are coming out to worship little upholding that\nMoney in the usa are almost exclusively on the side of the Democratic party and the question here is not just getting Democrats out the vote who voted that\nThis election needs to turn out at the level of the presidential election and twenty sixteen and I think that energy is out there I Know in my district in New York Nineteen that energy is out there but it has to be more than just wishing it\nTo happen you have to bring yourself to the poll you have to bring a person who didn't vote for him to the polls and that's how I'm ... you effect change and that's what the Democratic system was designed for\nWell one of the interesting things you mentioned New York Nineteen there are many people who now thinking that the Republicans are doing some things that are kind of a desperate for example [noise]\n... ... so that gives us a great transition Malcolm into Saturday the Saudi situation right now you said a mouthful in terms of what we stand for is a nation what is your contemporary thinking on that\nWell you know I spent my entire career working in the middle east and I specialized working with our forces as it often times the only American\nYou know African American or could speak Arabic to them which means that they brought me in their confidence a lot and we call these these little places where they talk the watts right where they're true selves come out [noise]\nUm and Donald Trump just found him self comfortable with these people they love a guy who can be brought who can be bought paid off they love that it's ... it's an integral part of the Saudi culture there everybody knows that you got to get your ten percent\nOr they love someone who hates women or if you use women as just sex objects as much as ... as they do I mean it it's just part of the nature of men\nOutside western world just everywhere they go back fifty to a hundred years interviews Donald Trump is in credibly comfortable with those people and he also loves the money and a luxury and they gave that to him in space but does that mean that we have to compromise\nEverything that we are\nBecause Donald Trump says that we ... we should\nYou know I mean this nation that fought and struggled and built\nItself could be the moral ... floor in this world that's gone we no longer on a moral example when we go overseas and I just spent a week in London and Paris uh everybody from you know both American and and and local or saying what is that what your country you know\nAnd this isn't a joke this isn't something you can laugh that we lose the money we lose trade we lose business we lose we act\nIn the rest of the world and Donald Trump thinks that he's gaining respect because the guys who are surrounding him including the Saudis who have just murder and American resident in literally made him into ... or he thinks that that's tough\nThat's not toughness let me tell you something I've worked with the special operations forces I've been in the dirt my entire career\nOr in the intelligence community tough Mrs or people can maintain their moral values and getting the job done this guy is not that guy\nWe a have a lot of letters and we want to get to those but on this on this case of 'em and and specifically the the question that that Alan asked you are in regards to what is happening here I'm this seems to be\nThat he is warning of a rush to judgment in the disappearance of ... he is saying that a Saudi Arabia was being judged guilty until proven innocent in connection with the disappearance of the Washington Post contributor\nAnd um we meanwhile meanwhile uh\nPompeo is saying that the Saudis promise to punish wrong doors in the show ... case so given that are specifically where are we right now because it it even if\nYou ... even if you take them at their at their word and and we're waiting until they are proven guilty until proven\nEven if you take them out there at their word and and we're waiting until they are proven guilty until proven innocent um it seems as though that is a is a strange card to play\nAt this point especially when you are so reactionary just so many other people I Know this goes exactly to what you were just talking about but but how do you how do you put that into a an overall narrative\nWell let me tell you something I I worked in total or as as as a military intelligence who subcontractor\nUh thirty six years in this business and in that part of the world and I will tell you right now we know what happened we knew what happened two weeks ago and it didn't have to come from the Turks do come from the Saudis we have a lot of resources [noise]\nUh you know in the slightest were crops up we have the ability to run it doubt Donald Trump knew\nThe details of this two weeks ago he did and there's just no way that he can say that he didn't but what he does is he doesn't believe U.S intelligence and when you see something that threatens his livelihood were threatened says his friends and and and other\nYou know I'm autocrats or around the world she just ignores much in front of them and what he's doing rallies he's dancing and he's dancing around the subject that he may have an incident which could break\nUs Saudi relationships and expose Saudi Arabia for the theocratic tyranny that it is and he just does not want to confront that reality\nAnd so he's doing this whole Kavanaugh like saying that you have to be innocent until proven guilty that's not the way it works in global geopolitics and global geopolitics you have to you gather the evidence through your intelligence agencies in your allies\nAnd then those people detour to make a determination in your own government whether this incident happened and that's why we spent a hundred billion dollars a year collecting intelligence Donald Trump goes that out the window and sides with his buddies\n[noise] All right ah thirty minutes ago we finished the fund drive and here we are now and uh the roundtable panel we are going to take a break when we come back we have lots of letters Malcolm announces with us Allan shark doctors here and we welcome your letters panel at WAMC dot O.

great\nTo the round table and a and tomorrow we have a wonderful panel set up and we'll be back to normal\nOkay that's great sounds great you're OK Kathleen writes good morning Donald Love went out Malcolm his own he said something interesting about a one party system do you think that the GOP can suppress the vote to the extent that this can happen even with the demographic changes in this country [noise]\nWell I think it's quite clear that he has that they have they have suppressed all they're doing their best to do it they're doing it in every way possible or and or can they yeah they can\nAh ended his up to the other side to make sure they get their people out and get them to vote and get them to recognize what their self interest is in the game\nBut they do and what their Russian counterparts of apparently done is try to discourage people from voting and doesn't matter there all the same I think yeah there's all the same you mean the Social Security system and its existence is all the famous no Social Security system you mean to say that are not allowing kids to be able to\nHave access to the and their parents to have access to the snap system so that people can have a a decent meal or that kids going to have a decent education you mean to say that those are are not differences but that's what they're pushing\nAnd you know what to some degree they get away with it in the mid term elections you get a twenty percent turnout if you're lucky or you got fifty percent turnout in the presidential elections you get a fifty five percent turnout and the election in the elections up hanging out on the Democrats are going to win [noise]\nSo um so it's just that little extra getting the people out so what do people do besides bitch about it do they say as Malcolm just said on the air do you do cameras your own neighborhood and say okay\nYou're going to come out and if you're in the nineteenth for example that'll make all the difference in the world are you going to come out and vote this time can we find a way to get you to the polls going can we help you are registered going to get you an absentee ballot going all of those things are the things that have to be done\nBut you know what complaining is just one thing but actually doing it is huge and very good friend professor that I talk with\nAnd if this if the last election as anything he was on the phone all the time he called everybody in the United states that he knew he said\nCan we get cannot how can I help can I Do something in that district so people say well I Can't help it because you know in my district everybody's going to be blue I said well first of all that's not true in each congressional districts upstate\nThey're having substandard education that those kids should suffer because the parents didn't go out and vote I Would like the parents to go out and vote I think they should go out and vote but I don't think that kids deserve what they're getting and same thing with health care and yeah you know\n[noise] All right um well it's been quite a morning Alan so were they\nWere a ... you end of the fund drive and uh it's all over we're back to regular programming or we're

grew up I took the best of the ... my father and the best of a gangster and I became in\nWhat did you learn about yourself about growing up about the the time that you would spend in the Bronx while writing that story originally in and telling it in a theatrical form\nA I learned that how much that those years of growing up there are shaped me a of who I Am and what I Am and what I what I Believe in and\nUh you know I grew up with a great great parents who courage me and my father was the one who said the saddest thing in life is wasted talent\nAnd he always encourage me not to waste my life and to do something with my life and that that life is special and I mean that's pretty incredible thing from a working class guy and he wasn't a he went to school we didn't go to college or anything my mom didn't but they were just\nPeople that wanted their children because I grew up with two sisters who are very successful\nYou went to school we didn't go to college or anything my mom didn't but they were just people that wanted their children because I grew up with two sisters who were very successful but to do that you know fulfill their dreams and and what I grew up in what I learned from the wise guys is\nUh how tough life could be and not to trust anyone and always keep your college close to the vest and that sometimes you think someone is your friend but they're not uh and that when it comes to uh\nYou're talking about the flaws I was struck in and seeing the show on Broadway when they're they're just these moments where there are gaps in the audience you know there's just there's people are [noise] oh that's where this was going\nWell you always have as a writer I always try to stay ahead of the audience if the audience gets ahead of you and that's not good that's when they get bored and looking at their watch they start coughing so the main thing is uh [noise]\nYou you just want to stay ahead of the worst thing you could ever get is a polite standing ovation that's the worst thing my stand in the city of issues that Bronx still got his\nJust want to stay ahead of the worst thing you could ever get is a polite standing ovation that's the worst thing my stand in the city of issues that Bronx Tale got is when the show's over Pam they jump up that's because they can't wait to jump up you know\nA that's a standing ovation when one two people stand another person [laughter] everybody goes I gotta say that you know that's not a thing of it out that's a but officially Evan Hansen they jump up fish that yeah they jumped right up I mean that's a great play I saw that I thought it was great so\nHow does that impact this not only I mean I could ask just about any aspect of the Bronx tale story whether it's a Bronx Tale story whether it be the one man show whether it be the movie or whether it be the musical of how then as your career path change\nHow does my career path chain in the sense of what you want to do next or what or or the roles that you're all yeah or or the or the opportunities you have as a as a writer and I want to do\nMore things uh uh I like to do my own things that I write or things that I really feel passionate about I just don't want to do\nI I I've been this way for the past few years but I just do I work in movies and TV of things that I like to do you know I'm OK financially I'm doing All right um I I just want to do things I Love to do I want to write more to the more I write the more I'm happy\nTo have more personal stories using\nTo yeah oh yeah I I think the my best work hasn't come out yet I'm writing a play now for I'm a member of the actors studio that I'm really excited about it yeah yeah\nAnd the the the idea I I think\nIs is obviously in in telling that story but ultimately to find a universal story\n[noise] ... you know what you know what you do look for universal story that's that that's that's like a thing that you can't do that you can if you try to do that you'll fail and you ... you write something that you think people want to hear the best way to right it's just something from the heart and hope that other people connect with it well\nRight I I I've heard it described as you know you don't sit down and say I'm going to write something brilliant write something and then hopefully people find that sometimes\nThey see a movie people see a movie then they see another movie they say oh I'm going to write something like that I I to me that never works out you know I write\nWhat I feel you know I listen to the people I uh I listen to talk radio a lot and I I hear what the people are saying and if it if\nIt is it's nice to be on top of those things before it happens and you go wow that's a good idea that I didn't I didn't know that you know and then you just get a feeling I I have a sense of writing things that are bigger than myself that are bigger than me and\nI I don't know you know when\nIt comes to the musical when these these incredible songs and the the just the incredible the entire production now when the show closed in June now it's on the road yeah what are you oversee that you want to be a part of all\nYes uh you know I'm One of the over the years I'm not the final word of course but you know if I see something that's not right I bring it up and we talk about it\nAnd when you bring it on the road and you bring it to other places I assume I mean we were talking about it being universal but I mean this is a story and it's a Bronx Tale obviously that has a residence when I was flying on Broadway in New York City\nBut it has a residents here in Schenectady hazard it'll have a residence when it plays the Fox in Atlanta they'll have a residence wanted it plays Kansas right\nBronx Tale is one of the biggest hits\nHave a residence when it plays the Fox in Atlanta they'll have a residence wanted it plays Kansas right\nBronx Tale is one of the biggest hits nowhere Japan Japan Japan now you tell me how to have [laughter] I don't know just hand loves a Bronx the movie love a Bronx Tale loves it just\nI mean I'm telling you is the most amazing thing when I meet people from Japan see me in the street it's like I Know something it's like scary [noise]\nUh but you know it just connects everywhere and it connects all ages people bring their children twelve Thirteen Years old because they see the message that he gives don't waste your life do something with your life stay in school\nIf you have the talent use it and ... and it connects with people in their eighties and nineties who just remember the old time and it doesn't have to and it's not white it's white black\nAsian Latin everyone says oh not yet I'm I I ... I grew up like that I had a guy like sunny yeah yeah so I knew a guy you know everybody it doesn't\nMatter I don't know how I did it I don't and I'm\nBeing not for a you know not full of humility I just wrote a story from my heart and whatever I did I wrote lightning in a bottle and it connects with everyone and I'm happy I did [laughter] ...\nYou said it took you ten monster I did not process is it is it just working out at the language and the and the characters ... well\nBecause I was playing all the parts I had to work on the characters how could I have three or four people talking at once and not and you had to know who was talking and not be confused\nSo that had to be worked out and I had a rehearsal odd because I did it all at accents and mannerisms and lights and and and sound so that took a while but and\nAnd I don't want to I don't want to put words in your mouth but I'm assuming that that those characters are ultimately inside you already in the sense of your writing them yes but they're already a part of you\nAbsolutely yes or some actors work from the outside in some work from the inside out uh I have to work for the inside out you know what I find when I have that thing inside of me what I Know what I hear his voice\nAnd then I could go the other way like De Niro who are certain actors worked from the outside of Bob works from the outside in like used to say well when I get to what I Know when I find out the shoes that the character with is that um I\nKind of sense I Know who he is he works the other way I work this way [noise] you know some actors put on there is some actors like myself to take off his ... is it so there's a difference\nAnd I I Would think though in a story that's personal and a story that is about you and it was about your father and it's about your upbringing and about the people who are close around you almost have to be from the inside\nYeah yeah I don't have to be but for me it is yes I work there is a piece of there's a piece of each person I Do inside of it\nAnd I connected with it organically you know I mean I don't know I mean that's\nPart of why I Do it I Do and you know God as good as you know humbly given me that gift and I and I are say thank you and I accepted and I work on it [noise]\nFinal question you you do the one man show you did the movie musical you start in the musical now the show is out during the country as just as an audience member and you sit back in\nYou did the movie musical you start in the musical now the show was out during the country is just as an audience member and you sit back and you're watching one of these performances [noise] those are still strike you does it do you still have those moments where you're like oh well this isn't a an out of body experience to see that they're\nNot as much anymore but there are times that could be sitting there like I was a I was when I was doing the musical on stage or I was and it wasn't even a she knows [laughter] I just happened to be sitting waiting in listening to my dressing room and the scene was what Robert Blake\nOr Rob a Richard like sorry Richard Blake who plays the runs with my father and the young boy uh Frankie I forgot his last name could there is that no no the young boy oh God I Can't think of who's who's listening who's just terrific and all\nOf a sudden they were doing the scene of the working as a ... slaps them and I was back you know I was ... it was like weird and I started to tear up in my eyes\nAnd then I knew I had to go on stage and so I just let it go away but it was like really strange like while I was doing it if all these years I don't I don't know what just just happen I just go to my dad you know and I kind of weird\nAnd of course there are people in the audience were having a very similar\nYeah everyone\nEveryone at the end of this show cries I mean you can you\nThey feel they it's something they're laughing at one minute you know I always tell this thing that Alfred Hitchcock who I admired so much\nUsed to say there's only three things you could do to an audience and if you do to add three you're doing great [laughter] because as you can make them laugh you can make them cry but if you give them that's it can't do nothing else in the Bronx tale we do all three yeah we do all three\nTwo days ago we were in down in New York City we've done ten or twelve days throughout New York and Pennsylvania in Vermont and California or turning all across the country with the truth is change the truth is change the book\nIs actually the script of their performance monologue with quite a few additions because it's a bit longer than the actual bottle on but that said WWW the truth has changed tour\nDot com so it will be a film um the the I think of it as a spoken documentary where I really go into the deep in the various misinformation campaign of Cambridge Analytica Steve Bannon of many of the forces that were altering public consciousness during the twenty sixteen election and they're still doing so now\nAs well as up against the backdrop of a very violently altered climate\nSo I'm a little bit about why the idea of doing a spoken word performance was the what you wanted for this particular work\nWell it's amazing uh my last film how to like go to the world I Love all the things climate can't change which is really the third part of the gas plant trilogy gas and oil and gas and to and how to let go I went into HBO all those films run HBO\nAnd they that movie did very well lots and lots of people watched it thanks to all the people who watched it and they wanted me to do a new project and we couldn't you know\nReally come up with it and finally Sheila ... who's the guru of documentaries of all time at at HBO she's my mentor and in in many ways my tour mentor\nUm who I Love she just points across the desk and she goes you're going to take that that show that you do all over the road we're going to make it into a one man performance we're going to put that on HBO and be you know so\nI had been touring with gas gas into was how to let go with a wake a dream from Standing Rock my my my last film on a Standing Rock and doing public appearances being out on the road with Bernie Sanders\nA my history of my my my origins as a maker of work as as in the theater\nSo she she knew all this and she said she wanted me to make this one man show so we worked on it for a year or in development with workshop performances in New York and in New Orleans in San Francisco and Los Angeles and it's finally ready now we're all over the country on tour with it but it was an idea that sprung up\nFrom Sheila in Evans who is it was a genius and I had to take it on but I Love it I'm I'm having an amazing time doing it we're having incredible audience has come out for this\nYou know and the responses from people had been utterly abusive so please do come out and check it out if it's coming to your town we're going to be in Columbus we're going to be in Milwaukee Lincoln, Nebraska Boulder, Colorado Houston Brownsville, Texas Los Angeles San Luis Obispo Chico Oakland to name a few as we head out uh what was the next couple of months\nThere is a scene in the book it's called how do things change and I guess that's the question that so many people have of how do we change things now things change because people get\nIt's called how do things change and I guess that's the question that so many people have of how do we change things now\nThings change because people get personally involved that section of how things change is basically asking a question of how did the fracking movement get started\nSusan fry in guy Arkansas a thousand fracking induced earthquakes in Arkansas she was completely obsessed but her husband was thrown out of his lazy boy chair\n... during a four point seven earthquake and I imagine that when he hit the ground something changed or Amy Ellsworth in Colorado who had you know fire coming out of her ... think explosions or water was still flammable due to fracking\nShe was showering in the dark for fear that spark from her light bulb will blow over across the street in the middle of the shower and I I imagine her they're freezing not being able to sleep terrified\nSomething changed uh or carry Greenwood who died of glioblastoma brain cancer a nine out of ten if his cabs on his farm were born stillborn and I imagine a his widow walking away from his gravesite realizing\nThat she buried her own husband before she buried the calf which was evidence of the racking contamination\nAnd has something there changed you know these are the personal stories that we go into in the in the play and in the in the film in the book about individual change we change our sense of who we are is on the line\nAnd we only change that the government we only change this country when we get involved when we leave our house where we go to community meetings where we volunteer when we participate and lo and behold that is also the solution to the terrifying isolation and depression than people feel in today's political climate\nYou spend all your time staring at your phone you're in a tiny little walled garden of all your own ... you have to do is fight fire with water and water\nIs us being in a theater together water is sharing information water is life and life is about truth and we can't have a sense of what we're doing is a democratic society without a mutually acknowledged verified sensibility of how we determine and derive truth we always do that as a collective\nAnd the things that the propaganda people would have us do is to separate and divide and conquer and the push smearing misinformation on our Facebook feed on our Google searches and other IP addresses and that is what one of the things that the peas addresses but we must change and we only change as a collective\nOne of the things I found fascinating and then just your your answer is is what that group can do what is it an audience can do\nAnd and it just seems that this time that that people need that need that together as they need to come together and they need to feel as though they're not the only one feeling the way they do\nAnd I need to look we all know that I mean\nIt could be on it's like we may gas that we may gas in part to he made these films on HBO\nThat was going into forty million homes the United states why did we tour I toward five hundred cities you know across the world in the last ten years the reason why is because we need to digest information in a in a setting where we can organize you know we used to say about gas and in part to go watch it alone it's too scary you know like psycho\nUm and and the truth is information out there right now especially with the climate and especially about the ways in which our democracy as being tampered with especially with the fact that we have with author or Terry and racist climate change denying anti science Tito\nAs the president these things are extraordinarily depressing an isolating the cure for our isolation the cure for our depression how we reinstate hope how we reinstate the American dream how we reinstate our understanding of how how we can get back to a society based on truth\nAnd goodness any quality is always going to happen in rooms together that's what we're trying to provide\nHow how we can get back to a society based on truth and goodness any quality is always going to happen in rooms together that's what we're trying to provide right to whether or not it's a film screening that you hosting you bring four or five or ten or twenty people into a room we have that program to allow people to do that free of charge\nOr if it's coming to the tour and most of the tour dates are free some of them are five dollars ten dollars whatever we want people coming into that room together and we've had incredible success doing that with a thousand people\nIn Ithaca to see the show we had hundreds of people in in narrows burg\nAnd in Vermont and and uh you know in West Chester, PA all these places that we've gone because there's a movement there and that movement at the end of that show they get up and they stand on their feet and we share and scream\nAnd that is part of what it is to be healed and restored so that's why we do these tours in it you know it it it is one of the most amazing experiences that I have just being able to see that that that\nHumid phase of what's actually happening in America America is not a dark place right now America is a place that under a tyrannical rule a Donald Trump was not elected by the majority of people who was elected by the electoral college and the majority of people in America\nFeel that there needs to be places for that to be an outlet and those are political rallies or political campaigns\nAnd of course that that's the theater and that's art in that culture so I encourage people get out go out of your house\nCourse read the book get the book but more than that let's find the places where we can community come together and we're going to be tar industry for quite a while a year or two so there will be opportunities\nThe book is the truth has changed for more information about the performance with tour dates and all of the information you need you can go to the truth has changed tour dot com the

S. obese who deserved to be fired right away\nWhen you see that he's talking about a congresswoman Maxine Waters as a low intelligence individual playing I think on the stereotype\nOf blacks as having low intellect you stop and say oh my God how did we [laughter] how did things turn around so quickly means seems to me like it's this is more than Thirty years in the past this is beyond that point when I was writing eyes on the price so it's it's so discouraging\nYou actually one of the one of the comments on the book is uh from none of Brazil who says or you know we might find the moral arc of our history suddenly bending backwards but we're we're doing that right I mean we're already been\nWell in so many ways I I don't know what to say it's sort of dispiriting isn't a joke but I mean\nYou know after the Kavanaugh hearings and I think a lot of women in the country for you ... you know something's going backwards here and I think that if you ask people in the Latino community\nIn terms of the anger that's being expressed towards immigrants not only in terms of uh the president's policies towards illegal immigration but I'm Talking about his desire he's he's proposed cutting legal immigration in the country\nIn all these ways what you see as someone who seems to be oriented towards\nPushing the clock back in time or maybe this is a reminder that his campaign slogan was make America great again and it was I think reverential of a time maybe in the Nineteen fifties that he sees as ideal but I think lots of people in a more diverse America and that's where we are today\nRealize it back in the Nineteen fifties there was limited opportunity for people of color and for women and that they fear going back in time before the brown decision before the civil rights act of sixty four before Dr King before Thurgood Marshall\nBefore you had people not only Democrats like the Kennedys and President Johnson but also Republicans remember it was Eisenhower who sent a hundred and first airborne into Little Rock\nTo protect the rights of nine children are trying to attend Central High remember that it was Richard Nixon\nWho with his Philadelphia plan was the first to talk about the need for affirmative action to help lift up and bill that black middle class community\nAh so it's almost as if Trump is pushing the clock back in time rather than embracing the idea that America is a country that's been always been about moving forward and being inclusive\nSo a couple of points one thing is I mean you were talking about ... what he called her and Maxine Waters and so forth but you know and the first day I mean it did that like that\nSo a couple of points one thing is I mean you were talking about ... what he called her and Maxine Waters and so forth but you know and the first day I mean it did that like the day that he was inaugurated as president he went after John Lewis of all people are as a civil rights icon he goes after John Lewis and he\nSays the Congressman Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district which is in horrible shape rather than falsely complaining about the election results all talk no action or results\nSad that was a John Lewis and bring it up because we're talking about this idea of what then of what then was referred to as the dog whistle\nTerm I'm sick of uh [laughter] I agree dog dog whistle we'll we're well beyond dog whistle there is no the dog whistle indicates that it's something that that is being done that you can hear well we're hearing it loud and clear aren't we\nI think so and you know again the facts don't support what the president was saying even if you say oh you know Joe won ... he's just you know punching back he's a great counterparts you're John Lewis criticized him so he's going to criticize John Lewis\nBut the facts aren't right John Lewis represents a prosperous area of Atlanta which is a booming city in America so you have to stop and think what is he doing I mean the words he feels he can create his own set of facts\nIn order to demean and to diminish John Lewis is standing but again I think Joe you and your listeners know John Lewis is someone who had his head cracked open bloody\nOn the Edmund Pettus bridge again marching for equal rights in Alabama\nSo he was a civil rights leader and today as a member of Congress often referred to as a civil rights icon but the but the President Trump he doesn't have any respect or reference for this man service in fact at one point\nHe said that he didn't think Louis was a brave man it's unbelievable\nAnd and again that idea of no action I mean that that again is is just the once again going into a stereotype and and so my my uh my question to you is as as you indicated a moment ago\nOf this this idea of of bending backwards but but it it's it's also giving\nA great strength to those those feelings of racism that are were bubbling under the service\nAnd giving them some credence and allowing them to be shared more widely than they were before and I I don't know and I ask you and and I mean obviously this book is a great help but but what do we do to combat that\nWell you know you just expressed it so clearly and I must tell you a job at your sentiment is reflected in the polls where you have now more than half of Americans in fact nearly two thirds saying\nThat this president has emboldened racist and white supremacist to express their views in public\nSo they feel comfortable with him as you may know David Duke has said he's our guy and then of course after Charlottesville\nThe president was reluctant to condemn even neo Nazis people standing with tiki torches outside of synagogues threatening the Jewish people worshipping inside he was reluctant even they were fine people on both sides\nUnbelievable so what you get is a society now and this is picks up on what we were talking about a moment ago when I did eyes on the prize in the late eighties\nSo what you get is a society now and this is picks up on what we were talking about a moment ago when I did eyes on the prize in the late eighties we thought we had reached a certain point I didn't think we would ever be returning to a day when we were the neo Nazis marching in the street\nThat's unbelievable to me I didn't think we'd come to a day\nWhere David Duke and the Klan would be pointing at the president saying that's our guy\nThat's our guy it's unbelievable and of course as we were just saying go I never thought we'd come to the point where you would have the president of the United states saying about a civil rights leader hero icon like John Lewis\nHe's all talk no action how can you say that about a guy who was at the head of a march and got his head bashed in talk about action but that's Trump ...\nYou know I Know we've talked about this before in past conversations but I'll bring it up again because it it seems timely as it always is I guess um but but of course a lot of this talk is coming out of the very network that you work for\nUm a lot of the talk of of\nThe the the these voices that they're allowed to speak of course as they should be freedom of speech\nUm are on the Fox network and I I Will just ask you a of how you feel about being a part of that organization than what you feel your role is in in trying in in some way to to level that playing field\nWell I think that's exactly the way I think of it I mean you know some of the things that are fed their concern me but I must tell you I'm inside that bubble are trying to burst and trying to present a different perspective I'm On the air every day at Fox News\nAnd I got to take my hat off to them in the sense that they know the message that I deliver no one tries to limit or censor what I say and as I say I'm they're quite regularly um and to me\nThe important thing is that there are alternate voices who are contradicting some of the extreme voices that you hear on Fox\nSo I Am appreciative of the fact that I'm allowed that platform to speak to people who are drawn to those kinds of Trump Trump like messages\nI mean to me show you know the important thing is that people get out of their bubbles and hear from other Americans and understand that other people have different prospective different viewpoints and you have to say\nIf your children and the Fox you know there's different viewpoint sometimes you don't it might not like I'm a but guess what you can hear the different point of view and here it prevented by people like me\nWe we think of him as a planter and a general and surveyor and what you know what you look at here is as I said in the introduction that counting he had when it came to being in the water\nYeah you know we think of them is permanently attached to his horse mattered grew up in the tide water\nHe grew up on the rap on a river or eventually ended up on the Potomac\nLiving at Mount Vernon which by the way is named for British admiral a and he had a keen understanding he you know he had no choice but to have an understanding of the importance of water this was a time before multi lane highways before railroads [noise] the only way to transport people provisions\nOf any number was by water uh up in your region it was the Hudson River that played such an important part in the\nRevolution [noise] uh and uh in the final years of the revolution the focus shifts to the Chesapeake that inland sea and whoever has control of that is going to have the ability to win the land battles in that vicinity and so Washington\nUnderstood this and and you know I ... the the subtitle refers to the genius of George Washington and he was one of these guys he he he wasn't a brilliant in the way that Hamilton was who could command all sorts of\nA random facts and and just deliver the most eloquent synopsis possible Washington with some of the was someone who could weed out the static of life for a focus on what really mattered\nAnd followed that with an intensity that no one uh could could a rival and so when he figured out\nIt was French ... naval superiority that was going to win it he uh place dollars energies and trying to make that happen even though no one seemed to\nFrench ... naval superiority that was going to win it he a place to all his energies and trying to make that happen even though no one seemed to cooperate with a division he knew was the only one that would win the war [noise]\nOne of the things that you know you're right about him and his portrait and and I'm drumming out a little bit but but one of the things you write about is just how emotional he became we think of him just being steady as Iraq but the highs and lows that we see\nFrom him during Yorktown are are quite surprising and and they're and they're it's quite a contrast isn't it\nYeah yeah no the you know ... why should we think of Washington as the the guy on the one dollar bill you know a statue staring us from mount Olympus or you know someone who's absolutely ... but he was he\nFelt deeply or he also uh had incredible control over his motions but in the year of Yorktown he's ... by so many of frustrating and raging events that you you know he cannot help it points uh express himself there's at\nOne point when he's on the Hudson new Windsor that's where his headquarters were on the west bank of the Hudson and uh he and Alexander Hamilton his foremost aid get into a violent argument and this airway staircase leading up to his upstairs\nOffice and it reaches the point where Hamilton says you know I just cannot take it anymore and they part\nThat's the end of their relationship at least a you know in the headquarters and you know this is not the George Washington most of us realize there's times when the French it becomes clear that the French\nAre following their own agenda you know they they're not in it to help us necessarily there in it to to uh um defeat the British and and there are agendas do not always match up until Washington is driven to distraction at\nTimes he's just you know raging with anger\nAt what the French are doing and then you see him when he finally learned that my gosh the French fleet has arrived it to the Chesapeake when he learns that on September ...\nThat the French are are a general Roche um bow and his entourage are about to arrive at Chester, Pennsylvania on the Delaware and they see this this figure jump leaping about\nAh with his hat in one hand his handkerchief and the other waving them up and down and they say who the heck could that be that oh my God it's Washington Washington was just\nSo elated he just had to let it rip you know this is the washing this was what Washington was like he was an emotional are fallible man but somehow was able to keep it together through this year of job like frustrations and torment\nAnd you know I call this book or in the hurricanes I I think the hurricane is a perfect metaphor for this year this was not a linear progression to victory this was a series of random event stirred up by forces beyond anyone's control and\nAt the center in the eye of the hurricane was Washington the one person resisting all those and trickle forces trying to blow things to smithereens and due to his leadership uh we are now and independent country\nIn\nIn what you just said about our relationship with the time with friends often goes against what were we have typically\nA thought of our relationship with ramps during the revolutionary war which is that it was it was a an ideal partnership or you you write that it was really anything about that and as you just explain that were great frustrations on the on the part of a general Washington\nAnd yet and yet in the end\nGuy bouncing up and down was able to put the\nAnd Washington and yet and yet in the end that guy bouncing up and down was able to put the ego aside and put ultimately the country I had and say okay but this is what's important\nYeah and this is what distinguishes Washington as he said at one point in a letter to French admiral big Ross who led the French fleet that defeated the British the battle of\nThe Chesapeake he said greatness is recognizing that you must do not what is good for you but what is good for others you know he had that ability to look outside of his\nOwn uh impetuous character and and operate on what he also called the great scale or you know it wasn't all about him\nIt was about his country\nAnd you know he's the he's the one person who sees this vision of what a nation we could be and he conducts himself in that way and ah you know so this is a different you know this is this is a model of leadership\nThat I'm a uh is is something where he's able to subvert his own ego or in dealing\nWith an ally if he knows it's in his country's best of the ... best interests um and I think it's a model of leadership that as a as relevant today is what ever was\nWe were talking to a Nathaniel ... new book is in the hurricanes I the genius of George Washington and the victory at Yorktown\nYou spoke of this is the beginning of our conversation in regards to the water and I I'm hoping we can just go back on that in and focus on the spotlight a little bit but the\nThe impact of the water had on the revolutionary war the the rivers the seas of of how of the impact of that not only just just Washington because we talked about Washington his cutting when it came to\nHis naval abilities but but just the overall landscape of the water\nYes I mean it you know I I come from the maritime background I live on Nantucket Island thirty miles out to see 'em a and but grew up in in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania are you know which is by no means of maritime center but it's on the rivers and I grew up with a real understanding that\nThe rivers were how good were transported back then\nAnd and in during the revolution it was who controlled the rivers controlled the destiny of the war and you know the Hudson was the the important thing in the middle years of the war\nOr ... uh and and when it came to this year of Yorktown Washington realize that a naval force was not only important in winning a naval battle but it could also be important\nIn transporting his army because of the roads are at that time were terrible\nAnd transporting an army five hundred miles south in the searing\nHeat of August and September was going to be very difficult largely\nBecause his army hadn't been paid in years and they're you know insurrections had already occurred the earlier in the year and he he just feared it would all fall apart and it was frustrating to him when the French said yes we will help you buy sailing into\nThe Chesapeake but we're not going to stop in New York first and pick up your your your army and so what this was once again\nEvidence of Washington's frustrations but also his keen understanding that a navy not only is useful in fighting naval battles but\nMoving large numbers of troops the British did this all the time during the war using their stranglehold on the Atlantic seaboard to their benefit Washington\nNumbers of troops the British did this all the time during the war using their stranglehold on the Atlantic seaboard to their benefit Washington seemed to be the only one in the room when it came to the allied high command that realize\nWhat exactly the sea rivers lakes or could do for for him\nI realized I'm asking you are a huge question but uh because it's the bulk of the book but uh if you could just give us a brief description because I found this to be fast moving um\nBecause I didn't know a lot about it which is the battle of Chesapeake and ultimately how that leads to a besieged Yorktown and makes that
