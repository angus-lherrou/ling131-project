you're chipping novel short not fun drive a week from today and by the way folks that's what it's all about it's all about keeping this thing going not letting go of\nHis uh his self will just be seeing the stakes are lying was a way of reassuring himself and avoiding or of eating really having to face truths about himself which was that he needed the people that he hurt people\nThat he was smaller than I mean it was a big kid but he was you know still a kid and so he developed a kind of grandiose sense of himself and bragged about his accomplishments a over and over again and so that's why people live and why he compulsively\nLives we all tell lies to ourselves\nWe all the look in the mirror and sometimes see somebody who looks younger than we are or um weighs less or more than we do\nUm there's lots of ways we tell little lie to ourselves and to others but Trump it's really a compulsive need all the time the other reason people lie like him is that they have trouble reading and learning in school\nSo they have to compensate for it by being more powerful more knowing more knowledgeable when actually they don't know that much\n... when when it comes to the lying I guess it it seems that we were probably shouldn't talk about this earlier but um you you would call him ... yes does does aligned go with that and and then ultimately what were the diagnosis me to the level of these nurses and\nWhile the level there's two kinds that first of all let's say lying does go with narcissism because one lies to oneself when things one is more beautiful more smart more loved\nAre able to do things without feeling guilty able to say things without guilt um grandiose says it will and so people who are narcissistic are very well protected\nUh by their lives uh from feeling anxious or inferior but nurses ism is born out of insecurity it's born out of rejection it's born from hurt so\nUm when somebody doesn't pay attention to you over time you may develop a compensatory\nA self love which is ... if your if your mother is not going to love you or not be there your father is whatever you develop a kind of narcissism that's pathological everybody has some narcissism because it is related to self respect but\nTrump's is quite grand his and ours is what makes his narcissism dangerous is that if there's a malevolent quality he really hates other people having anything that he doesn't\nSo he constantly has to tear things down he has to break that institutions he has to attack rules and regulations because his father set rules and regulations so he has to say I'm the one who can make America great again as opposed to what race\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nLet's make America great again he invited other people into the process as opposed to say I am making America great again so that's his narcissism and his grandiosity and it is is powerful\n... let me let me ask you as a as a clinical professor of psychiatry there's much been made about Rod Rosenstein wearing a wire\nPerhaps a taping the president in a way of of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment my question is is is ginger some um sarcasm which is ... is there anything that could possibly have come out of that taping session if it were to have happened\nThere was different from what we saw which was an easy one minute ramble right I mean I don't know how else to put it\nI Would say there would be nothing different I Would be surprised if there was anything different except some kind of direct expression of contempt\nIf it was there I don't know for his own supporters sometimes people like that actually hate their own followers and that might have been something that could be there but that's entirely speculative on my part [noise] um I've just seen that\nWith some people who\nCan't wait to get away from their adoring crowd if you will or he doesn't seem to be like that so I don't know that he would ever say those things so yes it that press conference was him in the raw he was ...\nHe was circumstantial he would come back to the topic some of the time but he also would talk over people who ask questions it really was self reverential he never showed any apathy\nTowards women or who have tried to come forward about\nJudge Kavanaugh [noise] and um I think that we would not have learned anything new that's a great question about\nWhether what would have happened if he had a frozen scene that sign it actually worn a wire\nI don't think we would have learned anything different about him he's he's very grandiose he's very uh exaggerates\nA him ... his own power and him self ah because he has this desperate need to be loved his desperate need to feel some kind of gap that is in his unconscious a of having felt betrayed as a kid\nAnd not safe from his father parish usually protect the trial from one another sometimes\nYou know when the mother's Adeline the father will protect or where the father's outlined the mother will stand up and protect hopefully that's why it's always good to have two parents if you can\nSo the big sixty four thousand dollar question doctor is is the man to be president of the United states\nHe is not and the reason is not is because of the things we've already talked about plus he's since skinned plus he's impulsive [noise]\nPlus he has a destructive part of himself he is a very difficult time experiencing empathy for other people and one of the things that a president\nHas to do and I think all presidents except for him have done to some degree or another is they try to protect to make the public feel safe from a safer than they\nStreaming support for

is not functioning as not as a containing function that a president should have [noise] um and that's because he never had that as a kid nobody could ever contained him and so he doesn't know what containing is about it really doesn't and he can't do it\nSo uh the other reason he's unfit is that [noise]\nIn order to manage he always has to have an enemy you always have somebody to fight against so it's either the press is little rocket man or whatever it is but she divides people to maintain his power so easily Vides and ideals so\nFrom a destructive so [laughter] and he keeps them very

crabs is dropping by roughly seven percent in just six years that is a stunning number\nWell that was that was true during the the nineties there was a um a period from Nineteen Ninety four to two

be safe to say is if the island disappears it will have a profound effect on the blue crab because blue crab dependence on protected water which to take shelter especially when it ... when ... when it mates and the the bottom of the bay is covered with pastors\nBasically of of seeing grass and it's in that seat grass that the blue crab or does his\nBusiness and you take the island away and you'll you'll take away the way in which at sea grass rides and and so the Arlen basically serves as a ... blue cat\nOn the on the one hand you'll you'll be minus a lot of ... so you could argue that the crab will will thrive if the island disappeared but the fact is that the habitat will be destroyed\nDoes the story as you do in the book um tell us a little bit about as ... and ... and his significant role in the story\nOK well let me let me explain a little bit about change your this is a way for of mud in March barely cleared the tides\nHighest point five feet most with three feet\nAnd it's about a mile wide by three miles Fong smack in the widest part of the bay and because it has so much open water to its west a lot of what mariners called fetch which has room to build waves\nFor for decades for generations it's been pounded from its west side by waves at just this is not a Sandy Island where the the surf just rolls up the beach it's just a a a plug of\nPT soil dark PT soil and which marsh grasses rooted so one way to come in they tear up huge chunks of the Martian carry it off and it never comes back\nIn other words the island is not migrating like the barrier islands is just disappearing so ten German were vaguely aware that their island was getting smaller and the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth but it wasn't until this fellow as Bert ... who worked for the navy on the island to\nIsland born but up by the contract workers for the navy notice from\nFrom his workplace that he could actually see pieces of it you know falling away and so he took an iron pipe any jammed in in the marsh\nAnd they measured the distance from that aren't pipe to the surface sound on the west side of the island and it's the first time in Nineteen sixty four that anybody at actually tried to quantify exactly how how much can she was losing\nAnd what he found shocked everybody I think that first year that the last twelve the shoreline and I became twelve feet now or so in the course of the you know when the time it\nTook a crab or to go from from diapers to cats ending its own boat his his island was three hundred or more feet now or than it had been and up and as berries measurements also showed that through the the sixties and seventies\nThose numbers started to accelerate by the late Nineteen eighties changer was losing our ports of thirty feet per year\nTo wave action now ten German will tell you well you know what's happening here is not sea level rise it's nearly erosion because they they separate the two phenomenon when in fact they are insured linked the reason that that\nThat erosion became more effective more distress\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place

and should be taken to to prevent perhaps the inevitable of losing the island\n[noise] well it's a ah [noise]\nIt's in a there is a fix the hit I Would hesitate to call the plant or a proposal but the Army Corps of engineers has a concept on the table which would call for putting a rip crap seawall completely around the islands perimeter and blowing and dredge Phil from the the dredging of navigation channels down but\nTo raise the level of its ground\nAnd uh you know that would buy it a lot of time that would be a lasting solution but it would also cost\nInto the hundreds of millions of dollars which will be a tough sell\nWhen we're talking about a community of of four hundred and sixty four hundred and Seventy people the um the corps has approached it not as a plan to save change here for its human inhabitants\nBut as a plan to preserve habitat for migratory waterfowl another animal life and it's three inches it might seem it has a much better chance of getting funding\nThat route and it would be than it would have if it if it pursued saving the town itself\nYou do point out this is Trump country most of the residents on tangiers were supporters of Donald Trump\nPicked her eighty percent of them yes they're there and remain a very enthusiastic Trump supporters\nGiven the the president's thoughts on climate change and the environment what were they were they voting for what were they were\nThey were hoping for a guy who could cut through government red tape and get them and get some help instead of studies the corps of engineers for years has looked at ... situation and\nHas performed one study after another trying to come up with a solution\nAnd ten chairman feel studied out [laughter] and uh and so they figured Trump puts his history as a builder and managing big projects\nWas the guy who might be able to actually get things moving and they shared also his his views on climate change because at ... deeply religious place it's a really a almost a

candidates and and the kinds of receptions they were getting on the ground but in a way Joe I had been I feel like I've been preparing to write this book my whole adult life\nThe things I've been drawn to in terms of travel and reading and people I've sought out and and the things I've written about I've always been interested in power in politics and race in history and economics and\nLarge power structures and how individuals you know whether they prosper or suffer\nUnder the power structures they're living under so\nI mean in a way I had been reading and thinking about these things for\nAll my adult life and um I just thought well if I'm smart and disciplined in my thinking and if if I keep my eyes and ears open um may maybe I can figure a few things out in the course of twenty sixteen\n[noise] one of the things you point out of course is that this country has struggled in ... as you able to we we had we've had two\n... one being the struggle for slavery ultimately told me moving in the civil war the second being the great depression\nYou make the point in this book but the ... and cultural forces that we're seeing now has brought us to would you believe is the third American interim crisis\nWhat do we call it\nWhat we call it I don't think we're we're we're there yet Joe but um\nIt will probably be something on the order of\nAn economic meltdown um such as happened in the great depression and and that we very much skirted the abyss of in two thousand eight two thousand nine I'm all those factors from the bus to two thousand eight are still very much in play if anything were more susceptible to an ...\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more

the future of the United states\nAs aid arguably genuine constitutional democracy and I think we will be faced with a choice of are we going to continue striving for that genuine constitutional democracy or are we going to become a democracy\nThe facade of adopt democracy where we have elections people vote we have an instance Lee free press freedom of assembly et cetera but\nWhere in fact the power structure is in is controlled by you know big money interest and um and the people who finance who who had the\nFinancial purse strings of corporate structure political structure in this country um the ... talk or see so I\nThink we're fast approaching that point where if we're gonna have continue with a genuine constitutional democracy\nHe pulled the population at large is really going to have to be galvanized an activated in order to preserve their political rights and their economic rights I'm right now I think we're\nWe're pretty beleaguered on those two fronts but there's still a chance to salvage the American dream of equality for all\nHow much of what we're seeing in the possibility of facing a third crisis caused by the greed that we read divisions that we have economically the grid divisions of culturally and socially and of course the divisions we'd have politically\n[noise] yeah um I mean the kind of government that the founders set up in which\nPower is fractured the design from the constitution was as we all know um it'll be three branches of government power divided among those because the founders feared\nAnd miss trusted concentrations of power with any one group or branch of government and\nThink what we're seeing is well because of that structure for American government to to do its job requires a good deal of cooperation\nAmong people of different political views\nCooperation and\nIn the middle part of the twentieth century for a good fifty or sixty years\nWe saw the fruits of that kind of bipartisan cooperation where\nThere were informal institutions and traditions that kept government functioning in a constructive way\nThat began to change in the Nineteen eighties and accelerate in the Nineteen nineties where partisanship became more and more the rule and obstructionism you know from one side of the aisle or the other\nAnd that makes people that makes the popular population at large I think you know over time very cynical and jaded about the political life of the country\nFor democracy to succeed requires that active engagement of a critical mass of its citizenry and so I think um\nStreaming support for WAMC

politics which is exactly the wrong reaction if we want to salvage our republic you know we need to be pushing the other way when we need to be getting more and more involved in politics and the public life for the country\nObviously your story is a very American story I'm interested in\nHow this than how we fit in to the rest of the world because we're seeing this unrest we're seeing you could make a case I assume that while the numbers may be different that the that the crisis that we're seeing in this country is is being replicated in many many spots around the globe\n[noise] yeah I don't think there's any question um you know with the fall of the Soviet Union in the early Nineteen nineties um some smart people were saying well the end of history has come liberal democracy has trial it's um the paradigm for government around the world\nAnd a liberal democracy along with free market economics is ushering in a golden age\nBut what we've discovered and then nearly Thirty Years' sense is\nGlobalism and an unrestrained free markets lead to tremendous economic inequality and dislocation and frustration among great masses of people\nAnd that in turn makes people you know just trust the prevailing form of government in this country and many others like Western Europe yeah which is liberal democracy\nA critical mass of people do not see that type of government working for them and so they seek out alternatives they also seek out scapegoats\nAnd um that kind of environment is is ripe for demagogues to come in and play on people's fears and worst instincts to gain power\nYou have a chapter in the book called during the chicken hog with Trump talking fast and loose in the time of been was war\nOr let us let us talk about that and this this idea of usa you'd

that's very dangerous I mean in a way there has never okay the reality of the situation is\nFor the past Seventeen Eighteen years the United states has been engaged in war\nAnd ... only a very small
