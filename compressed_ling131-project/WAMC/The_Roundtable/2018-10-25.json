clear a strong unmistakable message that acts or threats\nOf political violence of any kind have no place in the United states he continued in the same vein later Wednesday at a rally in Wisconsin and encouraging quote all sides to come together in peace and harmony\nBefore taking aim at the news media the media also has a responsibility he said to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and concert negative and oftentimes false attacks\nThat is where we are who would like to begin now in oh\nOkay I'm you know here's the deal this is a president\nOr who has in fact from the very beginning um said things like one leading a protest or out of the out of his meeting them pay him up I'm beat him up that's physical violence or folks and it sets a tone from the president of the United states\nLook we don't know who is done as it may be somebody who is unstable or and is just a it's just been doing it but the tone has taken me a been a set by the president of the United states\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo

that can be but I'm I'm willing to say that we don't know yet but it's a terrible thing and we have moved to a place and I hope the president accountable for it [noise]\nWell there are many things we don't know I figure it's presumed that it is a disaffected Republican who has been motivated by the\nPresident's ah overheated language what do you say disaffected meaning somebody who writes the Democrats and that seems to be a an obvious possibility of perhaps a less obvious possibility ... to foreign actor um who is trying to sow discord and have a lot of people in this country at each other's throats [noise]\nUm so but but I I'm I'm confident that I'm confident that the FBI we'll we'll get to the bottom of it uh I I think to reiterate part of what out and said I'm the president is failing miserably if he is attempting to bring this country together\nHis language is his has been has been a division from the beginning and at a time like this when there are people who are scared or with justification about what they may find in their mailboxes\nThis guy is not stepping up and he is not trying to bring the money for him to get up at the White House yesterday\nAnd make some comment about now's the time to unify\nThe country it's almost laughable because we know he's reading it off of a script\nBut in fairness we would have toward them apart if he didn't\nSay yeah well he said he has been saying but much less than he should have a clip of it but I'm Sorry and I know we have a lot of other panelists\nBut it is interesting that he gets up because we have to unify we have to obey together but let's face it it's the press that needs to their some of the responsibility here which is a theme that he has been saying for the very beginning and that is really\nSo in my in my view I I've I've come to the conclusion that uh it is entirely\nRidiculous to expect this president sound presidential he once in a while had some aid that gets salmon says you know you need to really sound a little bit differently today but really our standards have become so low um it is truly appalling where we are today\nUm I I find myself in the classroom a lot just discussing where we're at and people's fears about where\nYou know whether this country is headed with the extreme polarization and President Trump skill unfortunately is to pursue polarization and whatever language she uses for just a few sentences related to coming together and unifying as a nation\nIs just unbelievable who were not representative of anything he stands for your what are the students saying\nWell the students are saying this is really worried sometimes it's not something that we want to see in our future we want to have discussions we want to have debates we want to talk about issues and all it is it's about scare mongering and they're not embracing in the vast majority this kind of\nA level of conversation and they're often feeling left out and not listen to\nI think there's something about when you when you say the words that the president said both yesterday and ah yesterday during the day and then last night at the rally there's something about it that rings hollow when about halfway\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no ... no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand

wide wrestling a\n... a federally federation which are office manager right you know that he everybody thinks it's all in good fun we're just at that this is real ... a lot of people could have been hurt or maintenance may yet to be hurt\nType patents people handle those type fans I mean this is\nThis is this is not fun this is\nUm is is that you know just for the sport of of uh of it and it's been very very distressing\nAnd if they go off or don't go off their inside inducing and terrorizing it's a crime I reject that kind of use of violence either emotional or physical it's unacceptable and we really need to address those kinds of\nResponses on the political level ... yeah I agree that the specially with that last point that um\nYou know whether you know where the bombs go off or whether they don't I mean the the the damage in the harm is you know the fear and you know as much as anything obviously but you know you know thankfully no one was physically hurt but I I I agree with you that the\n... the damage done by that kind of fear is is is is just as bad in some ways maybe more pervasive\nUm then maybe all more and competing um I Do think that um you know part of the problem is you know kind of the discussion you know that that we've heard here today which is you know everybody in the first sentence says yeah it's really bad and then everybody in the second sentence says\nAnd it's this guy's fault you know and I'm sure if we're on the right wing station there but he would say no it's a left wing fault 'em then I think that um I'd like to I'd like to see um yeah I agree I'd like to see the president's they stay more on message of what his original statement was whether you think it came from him or not\nUm yeah I'd like to see everybody do that and that just say you know I'd like to divorce this event\nFrom whatever the underlying issues are and it just says you know what no matter what it is you know it's unacceptable um and that period and then when you're talking points and two of us will point to him but he was on\nThe harder to do when the individuals who were targeted were the very individuals who were targeted during the rally is with the president\nI I think it's hard to do I think we've demonstrated it's hard to do the answer is yes and then I but I think it's hard to it's hard to divorce you know the emotions are from you know the passionate we feel about the issues I think that\nLook at it in in a more perfect world everybody with one voice would say\nI don't care who's doing it I don't care why they're doing it you know it's unacceptable\nIt's on ... and you know it it it it's unacceptable whether it's coming from the right or the left or foreign actor every memories with that yeah except it's distressing though how quickly people's people say that and then they move on and on top\nOf that it's a hot is the person who holds the highest office in the land if\nTrump cannot set the tone for shift and following up with action namely he had opportunities to highlight things and policies that actually um led to collaboration\nRegarding the opium a issue he had the opportunity to highlight something where people came together instead he does not pursued that so rich so rich\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both

obviously he's he's he's a different kind of president and obviously he's he's he's you know he says things that are abortion rude and and and on presidential\nUm but I ... for you to say that as the same thing you know we said about about the last president but I'm at you\nSo you think that this equivalency between this president and Obama yeah I think reasonable bomber who never raised his voice who never I'm never ... said to somebody we take this guy out and beat him up\nI think both of them recognized and then exploited divisions in American society\nCan you imagine the very favorable response than most in this country would provide if there was a a a gathering in the White House today and Trump walked into the East Room followed by Clinton\nSome people are better than rating of ... and others I mean but okay go ahead\nI've always thought that should actually be illegal I've always thought that if you're either going to be in office or run for office the one rule we should have is you have to write your\n... and you make a good point if you have to do it probably doesn't just be done and I I I get a great point if you have to do it for the Mars you should have to do it as president of the left side\nOf the United states does have a few duties and writing speeches takes a long\nTime now I live in the middle of your mind I don't\nKnow the response to that is and his or her most important duty is communicating with the American people there there's nothing more important in a president ... can be doing then writing the remarks that are either going to go to the American people or to Congress or to people overseas I think that's the most important and you\nCan have ideas I mean I wouldn't have had Sorenson if you wrote profiles in courage for um the JFK and he said I Can't answer that question and by saying I can answer that question he was answering the question if you think\nOf things that's more like ... ... one of the reasons for its popularity with his base is because they know their he's really talking to them and it's not candor there and if I go to yeah but I I just think that should be I think that'd be cool war\nYeah and just say one of the rules a model for only rule yeah we all have to be able to be thirty five and ... he might have to cut\nBack on his golfing adventurous then\nOkay is TV and Bob says\n... ... and we did a already okay

that uh there were there was a lot of rhetoric about you know the millionaires and billionaires excuse me versus you know versus the people on on on the street I think there was a lot of rhetoric about you know cops versus a cops versus people living in inner cities\nUm I don't know maybe that's what politics is it is figuring out where where there is dissidents or at at addressing I guess that that is addressing issues and we've got the\nWorst of all which was his insistence that Americans have decent healthcare and it was a little side dynamic of something in my voice\nYeah and I mean on the police question I mean this country has the violence that show I'm just pointing that out and if you're African American and look from that perspective um you worry about your young people and your son's in particular so I Would say this was a major issue to be addressed and to be\nA responded to in especially when it comes to stand your ground laws\nYou know and I I agree it it's interesting that under it it um and I don't I really draw conclusions from this I just I I've noticed that under you know we we had lots of issues with um with basically you're African American men

African American men being targeted like like we did but now it's like the pendulum has swung the other well\nI mean I'm hearing about you know cops being what a surprise that is it's sort of like you know the question about the situation of women it's not been discussed for hundreds of years and then suddenly emerge as a I Would establish that parallel how about the fact that people that have not had a voice\nSuddenly gain more of a more representation on media and discuss social issues and they emerge and central questions about who we are and members of the society\nHere I think Richard's point not to put words in his mouth because you know I never could do that [noise] um but but I but I think Richard's point here is that the messaging becomes very different depending on who the president of the United states if you\nAre no doubt about it but the difference between Trump and Obama among many differences is the big language that Trump uses\nThe I'll call street language that is just so on presidential I mean the ... one could argue that Obama was very provocative and a number of different ways but but Trump or rather Obama\nWas his his speeches were thoughtful sometimes Tour de but certainly articulate a I don't I don't know that you can describe those use those words to describe what Trump\nIs and you know the other point I Want to make President Obama was certainly know deep left wing ideological person because he even changed its own opinion on gay and lesbian\nRight and they were the right we probably argue with you about that but I but I don't I don't object to a president who who changes his views on line he's evolved if makes the presidential believed to be thoughtful we can't I don't think those words can be applied to Trump\nI I think it's ... I think that I agree with you that ... one of the problems I think that we all have to get an even those people like I like me who support the president is\nThat now he's not he's not presidential and and and and really any sense that that we've ever been used to I I think they show some leadership qualities that that our presidential but I agree it look\nWe've said this all the time\nIf some to me if somebody had Trump's ideas but could couched them the way Obama you know who looked and sounded and had the presence of Obama but had the kind of ideas that we can get behind that would be the perfect person that's why I watch the west wing on that point because that's the that's the president I Want\nYeah Mike says where is the Democratic or Republican leadership why is that no one's standing up loudly incorrectly blaming this president is in ... for creating this environment of eight\nThis is directly Trump's fault [noise] pardon me\nHe feeds off and said he loves distraction he loves fear\nIs quote rallies are nothing more than a breeding ground for hate\nAmericans want some one to stand up and directly asked Trump to be leader and president and that's Mike from Saratoga Springs but Mike I I have to say I saw Joe Biden attempting to do that or just yesterday the day before\nUm and doing it I thought rather effectively standing up before his own crowd and and and and listing the number of transgressions of the kind you said\nA from I'm here [noise]\nSo anyway I wanted to read but go ahead\nOf the prior readers mentioned Silvio Berlusconi and he may be\nYear so anyway I wanted to read but go ahead\nOne of the prior readers mentioned Silvio Berlusconi and he may be perhaps the best person to compare President Trump to because Silvio Berlusconi use is very similar similar populist techniques and we should also watch the presidential elections in Brazil\nIs that's particularly individual will be elected we will have a new level of horrific populism in one in the largest and most powerful economy in Latin America so this is a pattern that we ... we ...\nWe may see it in Brazil we certainly see it from President everyone in Turkey and this is just not a direction they would uh be beneficial to any democratic development rich\nIn the world know ours because uh I I I don't disagree with with with with a lot of that I you know what you know I understand what's going to get Trump's share the same hair products\nAnd apparently the same place now we have to go to I Want to be done to George ... fans as well to tell John who wrote in that I lowered my chair [laughter] uh uh we\nWe we go to Richard ... by by what seizure lowers your eye on the largest year alright where's their break we'll be back and we'll continue representatives\nSupport comes from Saratoga hospital introducing Saratoga OBGYN that Myrtle street and affiliate of Saratoga hospital formally Myrtle street obstetrics and gynecology Saratoga OBGYN daughter worked for information Fulton County tourism and the southern Adirondacks park\nForty four lakes forty four choices camping fishing hiking and more fall events throughout October calendar at forty four legs dot com Norman Rockwell's museum Stockbridge presenting the final days of keepers of the flame parish Wyatt and rock well on view through October twenty eighth an R.

I think if if if our CD was here um I I he'd probably say at least part of this is some of his geo political\nUm at some ... aside from the tower some of it is the towers and I just remember I said okay I got you you have to assume that I'd I'd a significant part of it is the increase in interest rates right which as interest rates go up people move money out of the market\nIs so you know I I you know but part of the problem you know when presidents do this when Trump does this do you live by the Dow you die by the Dow right and and I will also say you know even as a conservative and as somebody who you know who in my business we watched the market\nYou know the market in some ways I I think it's a surrogate for kind of public opinion I I I really do I I think that um it's not exact\nAnd and it's not immediate but uh it if the market stayed down for ... you know between now and the midterms I I don't know that that that would not that got hurt Trump that's got to hurt the Republicans\nYeah I'd you know whether it stays that way I\nI don't know yeah what do you think about that at the housing market is one of the major concerns obviously right I mean the numbers have gone down a little bit and that industries but equally concerned right\nAnd and again I I'm not the expert found were here I think he probably feel honor bound to say that's also part of the increase in interest rates right so it interest rates go up mortgage rates go up it it it it it's more expensive to buy a house uh and and and so yeah and then you also\nSo as interest rates go up mortgage rates go up it it it it it's more expensive to buy a house uh and and and so yeah and you've also probably say the same thing about the housing market\nAs you say about the stock market that it has been a little overheated right and and there's time for it to cool off um but yeah I think that the extent this we've learned a lot about the market is that you know one day one week doesn't determine a trend right so ...\nWell can I ask rich 'cause he's still identifies himself as a Trump supporter and the conservative and independent we well I mean I don't ever justice started out when we hear so many of the Trump supporters wanted to go with Trump because he was going to shake it up in Washington he was going to knock down all the walls\nBecause they among other things didn't like it didn't trust government\nAnd and what doesn't add up for me is how the frequency with which he lives demonstrably not just political allies but factual lives that can be easily disapproved why has that not shaken the the base who didn't want their government lying to them I mean this guy is\nSupport for streaming WAMC comes from the Davis financial group providing fee based financial planning and wealth management services to individuals families and business owners and the pioneer valley and beyond Davis financial G. R. P. dot com\nIs we actually fee of that I'll I'll speak on [laughter] you're right and I we you know that I I feel that um I I feel he is you know you say he lives all the time I feel like he is the most transparent\nI'd like I feel like I Know more about what he's thinking than I've ever known about what any president had thought I feel like I get more of his on what's the word unvarnished yes unvarnished unfiltered but there's another thing\nOh I think it's it's a good thing that I'm getting it now I might I don't agree with it all I don't I don't like it all but I I mean ... to ... to me that that that's an amazing thing I'm\nYeah what about the line who what what about lying\nI you know I Will take I I'd like to start I'm willing to start with the raw material\nAnd sift my way through it myself\nAnd determine what I think is a lie what I think is his you know pa furry ah you know what I think it's just his very elliptical way of talking which you know those of us who you know used to follow him on CNBC we're used to that I'd rather I'd I'd rather make that filtering decision myself\nThan having to go through like we were talking before you know six levels of speech writers at a teleprompter and then and then spinners after that\nYou know I mean could cause Trump is kind of an spin a ball you know I mean you know Sarah Sanders can do what she wants but I I Would so the answer is yes\nSome some of those things are are incorrect some of them may maybe outright lies I don't know I what I like is the transparency the lack of filter and the idea that I'm being given the opportunity quote make those decisions on my own\nQuote he says what he thinks but of course if you look back on the great desk but in history they said what they thought also so how does that justify bin Laden that I could\nHave ... now and I ... a lot of the a lot of them\nAs um give me some specific examples listen I'm\nWhen we talked about when we talked about health health care for a long time\nLet's fix health care let's fix health care and then all of a sudden after somebody was elected than it was ... ... let's fix health care insurance it turns from health care to health care insurance\nI Know that that was that was a that was a big change for a lot of us a and a and that was something I feel that wasn't terribly transparent or the during the campaign though that um that you know the thing about Trump is\nYou know I I Know you guys just like him and and and for a lot of good reasons but you can't say you're terribly surprised uh-huh that's right from the from the primary the general full now\nBut I mean I'm Sorry and this was more surface you question and I apologize for it but I'm just curious\nBecause I'm I'm I'm interesting when you say of of the did you see 'em on varnish but do you feel that he has a a grass and a and a full command of the of the issues that are on his plate slash the national agenda\nAll right let me give you the flip answer but there's a little bit to an end and one of the answers is\nHow much do you need okay what's your average is like oh how can you say that\nReally how these issues we kinda all know ... there's only two ways to stand on a lot of these issues right you see the big government of small government as well either more entitlements are less than ... them it does either\nIt's either we're doing the right thing in the inner cities or we're doing the wrong thing so I Do I think he has enough of a grass to deal with those issues yeah I Do also\nWhen you when you can hear the case that and it doesn't seem like Kim\nOh I see I think he does show I think I've\nTo deal with those issues you know I Do also\nWhen you're when you can hear the case that and it doesn't seem to\nOh I see I think he does Joe I think I feel I Know exactly where he stands on things\nSo it's a great does splits in history so I Want to go back to that for a moment you knew where they stood you know what they were saying juice should be killed or something and I should be happening and what wouldn't be voted out he could be voted out well that's\nWhy he's also there's lots of it a lot of things he's tried to do that he couldn't do cause according well here's here's one\nThing I wanted to say on the domestic in the domestic arena you can make the argument that you don't have to know the specificity to the extent that you know you you make the argument large small government\nThat is entirely inadequate for the international arena when you look at Yemen Saudi Arabia Brexit and so on and and that there you really know I Know the complexity of issues and he's entirely inadequate\nAnd I think his greatest triumph have been on on the foreign policy had her head and I don't mean to you I had no no he's not lying about the fact that they're that ISIS has a lot less power that it had before he's not lying to me about the fact that he's very supportive of Israel he's not wanting to me about the fact that he didn't like the Iran deal\nAnd he wanted to get out of it and he did\nHe's not lying to me about the fact that he opposes Islamic fundamentalism for whatever that means I now you may disagree can very clear\nNo he is not because he doesn't understand that Islamic fundamentalism it's sponsored by the ... hobbies in Saudi Arabia and he is Trent action oh entirely in his interactions with Saudi Arabia and we have been bombing\nIn assistance with the Saudis the many and that is where you will get a lot of the Islamic fundamentalists\nAnd he has also not understood what is happening with Iraq and Iran\nAnd the gains that Iran is currently making in Iraq so he's bungled the entire Middle East policy and he for your mostly say that it's okay to know who your enemies are based on whether they're Islamic off a certain kind or something else then you are entirely\nUnder miss understanding how foreign policy ... work plus I think\nI think anybody who who sees the situation he was given an in Syria that I think it was a bungled situation way before he got there I think anybody who sees the Iran deal which was a bungled deal well before he got there I Would say that ah that\nHe he he's been he's been dealing with the hand that he's been dealt with I think he understands enough to be able to advance our interests which I don't think had been advance I don't blame them in our interest\nIn the middle east have been advance at all I agree with you that Middle East policy in this country has been bungled for decades\nAnd in that sense I think we would agree that both um you know starting with the uh GW Bush presidencies hinge Obama into Trump it's been bungled\nBut do not misread the middle east policy is having approved at all in the middle of a shocking statement from somebody who clearly does not understand what is happening in the middle east\nI think I think that that America is a safer place than it was a ... when faced with Middle Eastern threats\nOh well I'm Glad you're believing that\nWell the underlying it to me the under ... there have been presidents with whom I disagree that maybe if you're trying to get us all 'cause you know I just want jobs I read it all up or go ahead get used to make a case on a policy issue domestically or foreign\nUm I Want to be confident that at least I'm hearing him telling me the truth about I commend done it's up to me to make a decision whether I agree with them or disagree room I don't believe a word of the man to the demands as I've said\nI'm hearing him telling me the truth about I commend then it's up to me to make a decision whether I agree with them or disagree room I don't believe a word of the man the man says I've said that on this program I think before he was elected but um so I think most out front on that but you know I I listen to him ah I don't remember what it was about the other day\nAnd it was not even a ... a major topic\nBut I remember thinking to myself I don't know that I Believe what he's saying and how can you how can the country go through wondering if the president is lying to them and you you don't think he's telling the truth on for example his position on immigration I don't know I might be a while I don't think I I don't think he's telling the truth when he says\nOther Middle Eastern terrorists in the middle of this caravan and then finally you know I don't have any proof I mean he's for days and you and Fox and friends are saying\nThey're these terrorists are from the middle east and Mexico in the middle of the Caribbean when an send me a lot of people believe it now is it true\nI perhaps but he doesn't know that\nBut I don't think that's the main thrust I write I don't think that's the main thrust of his argument I think the main thrust of his argument or something and you might call superficial but the idea that you know it starts with borders it starts with protection of the borders and and I don't I\nWould have held now does that hold me the truth on which the fact that you're making your decisions or ... or ... or accurate\nBut it does not start with borders let me point out the fact\nThat we have enormous numbers of people purchasing drugs that are coming up from Central America in addition to you know of course China attending a you know ... you know through the mail but Central American drugs\nAnd South American Central American drugs coming through Mexico in the United into the United states we have lots of customers for that\nAnd then we do Mexico the favor of returning the weapons that they that drug cartels can purchase in the country and ... and and and people bringing them back into Mexico we create a lot of violence ourselves in Mexico\nYou know some of these things I was thinking about your dad the other day I have created an ... of Pete Seeger station\nAnd they're always playing Woody Guthrie they're playing Woody Guthrie and they're playing you of course and then they're playing Dylan and feeling of course like Pete is an ally of woody but they took different past and they beat in Dillon we're not exactly the same\nNo you know Pete remained somebody who was fundamentally a public person\nHe liked people he liked being around new idea he liked going places and discovering new songs and new faces and then when it's not that way you know he's a private person he doesn't probably enjoy the publicity of being himself\nAnd I don't think Pete paid attention to his own publicity so much but he wasn't afraid to use it when it came in handy\nBut you know it's so new on top of our low and he said something and I said well you know for God's sakes you Pete Seeger and he said that's the problem is the Pete Seeger thing it's that Pete Seeger if this was\n... we all have this I mean I was writing about it yesterday when somebody gets on the stage and becomes an entertainer [noise]\nIt doesn't matter if your dog died the girl left or what the problem was\nYou got to get out there and be entertaining\nThat means that you create a stage persona that in any other endeavor would be considered a psychological disorder multiple personality or something like that you have to have to you guys at work and you're talking on the air it doesn't matter what happened at home you got to come in and do your thing\nAs an entertainer that become second nature and there are ... episodes with Pete that are always described to me and to others in the inner family up his\nWife Toshi led to put up with the stuff yeah it's the spouses who have to put up with these multiple personality people you don't know who you're talking to I mean you look at the guys playing the banjo is that the Pete I married or set the Pete that's on stage you know saving the world it becomes a problem\nYou know they consider our producer and I showed up but the thing to do an interview with a one time and it tells you turn around and said something like I'm not talking to beat right now he did a very very bad thing [laughter]\nAnd I haven't figured out what it was I didn't dare ask [laughter] you know believe it but she always talked about having a suitcase always ready by the J inspired my wife who says the same thing to ask you and she had a suitcase backed by the door just in case you know yeah that's really amazing because guys like us\nTo try and those people crazy I mean my own kids I remember you know when I first took them out on the road with me and they were very young and you know they'd be fighting backstage or you know arguing about who's crown it was something like that and they'd come out on stage and they have these ... faces and after the show\nThey'd be fighting backstage or you know arguing about who's crown it was something like that and they'd come out on stage and they have these ... faces\nAnd after the show I read um the riot act I said look I don't care what your story as backstage you want to fight and argue and jump around and do all that at some point soon as you can out there it's a different thing you gotta learn to be a performer if you're going to step out on the stage and ever since then they did it\nOkay what made me cry anytime we played it a thousand times you know Pete in golden river and you know and you're wonderful Sara Lee singing that song which is how old Fifteen Years old yeah she was fourteen worth seeing what\nA song that was and it's still one of the best things that I ever was I heard people play it and then you know I think is ... and Sara Lee was better I mean she had that quality to her that was so extraordinary\nShe is really fun and she's been you know with me on the road off and on for over Twenty years it's hard to believe that having that she started when she was fourteen and we took her to I think it was one of these big venue sort of like tangle with but it was in Virginia it was called wolf trap\nAnd we put her on the stage and said okay saying you know golden river that make people happy\nAnd she looked at me she was terrified\nBut she did it and afterwards he gave a big hug and which is ... was not his style no he was not warm that way you know but he couldn't resist and she's been doing it ever since we just did it it was part of our tour on the last tour we were on we did it for over a year and a half every night\nAnd you bring the same guys with you for years and then you try something else and then you go back to some of the same guys I say with Shenandoah night that was the original bad right\nYeah well originally when I first started out I was working with a good friend of mine John pillow who was on guitar and a guy named Bob ark and who was a brother to\nAlan Alan Arkin right and I played bass for me for years and a wonderful percussionist named Paul Modi an or Paul motion more recently and this was before folk music it wasn't identified we were playing jazz is what we were really that's what they're for days where a lot of people\nDo recognize that you were a pre Yemen and guitar and wonderful musician and people think well you know earlier we got that guitar no you should really good\nI appreciate it you know what I realized about\nI don't know five ten years ago that you have this feeling I mean I worked for over forty years climbing a hill as it were\nAnd that got to the top and I stayed there for very long time and then one day about five years ago I thought OK this ain't the top of the hill anymore I'm going down the other side\nAnd there's this sort of graceful decline that Pete expressed in his concerts he wasn't able to play like he had when he was he couldn't sing like you did when he was young but he did it anyway and it was good enough it was not only good enough it was even more inspirational\nFit was and he did this concept for us just before he died for WAMC and\nHe sang a you know I looked over Jordan and what did I see I don't think there was a dry that house rent but although I've seen so many times and you haven't lost a thing now let's spend a few minutes on this new book of yours how riches\nAre low Guthrie analysis restaurant the illustrated story what can it\nOkay back in Nineteen sixty nine the movie out this restaurant came out you know get on by Arthur Penn wonderful director who happen to live in Stockbridge yesterday and he loved the song that he heard on the record that came out in Nineteen sixty seven and he wanted to turn into a movie\nStockbridge and he loved the song that he heard on the record that came out in Nineteen sixty seven and he wanted to turn into a movie the problem was that the song I only takes twenty minutes to go and the strongest mostly true a movie takes an hour and a\nThat means somebody had to make up an hour and ten minutes [laughter]\nIn order to make the movie\nAnd that's what they did so typical on Hollywood took a bunch of characters informed them into one and the issues that I had was we were using my real name ... I was Arnold Guthrie in the film I wasn't playing a part\nAlice ... was played by Pat Quinn yes but she was using ... actual name\nAnd so people who see the movie right are assuming that what they used to eat is true because part of it was true the part that they based on the song was true and so this little book is a celebration of fifty years since the movie and it leaves out the hour in ten minutes of fiction\nAnd illustrator in black and white to tell the tale that was on the record but as it was depicted in the movie if that's not too complex\nNon room we've interviewed Arthur before he passed about this a fabulous story and it's not the only thing that's fabulous it's the fabulous our logo three there's nobody like I'm going\nTo be right here in Albany or the egg on October twenty six in the ... the state theater on October twenty seven on November sixteenth are low and Sara Lee planes into the hall in Hartford, Connecticut\nAnd back in ... on November Seventeen at the ... hey we performing arts center no matter what he says he's the best the best and let me tell you we're all in love with them in all very very grateful that you're still doing what you're doing or or you just keep\nA man [laughter]\nAre will Guthrie's speaking with WAMC is Alan ... talk you're listening to the roundtable on WAMC\nSupport comes from Woodstock guard exchange hand to blow glass and sculpture curated fine art exhibits from artist then makers throughout New York state and beyond route twenty eight west of Kingston\nFacebook or Woodstock art exchange dot com lumber yard Center for film and performing arts Catskill presenting interactive electronics artist Andrew Schneider nervous system in residence before it's opening up bam November third and fourth lumber yard dot org\nSouth ... spirit shop south that group ...

worked with Kenny directing my own place and he's directed me and some August Wilson place and and other people's place so we have a pretty good track record of working together\nVicious a very timely story and more than anything I think it speaks honestly and truthfully to the issues that it takes off\nAs a playwright yourself what do you find particularly challenging or enjoyable or how whatever adjective you would use in working on someone else's new piece\nOh wow you know I have to I have to leave the playwright and me you know at home when I go to ... an actor I'm but I'm certain that whatever inside that I have as a playwright and to structure and to craft doesn't hurt me as an actor\nBut yeah I Do try to leave let's say right I don't try to develop play right how to write us play I Try I Try to bring life to what the playwright is put on the page to try to find what that playwrights intent is\nAnd what has the playwright put on the page for you and the ... what are you learning as he play this character\nOr you know something I've always known as a playwright I guess and he's done it very well characters had are conflicted characters that change their minds characters that have conflicted views things that they're sitting on the fence about or that they haven't made up their mind about or\nThat character's get new information in the course of events of the play that changes their mind about themselves and that's what's wonderful about plays in that I think what we do I say this all the time I Do believe what we do can heal this you know what I mean I Know that his therapeutic value for people who write\nYou know to to purge and and and the and I think it can have the same kind of effect if is honest if it's clear\nAnd if it's truthful which is I think true of this play it is clear it is truthfully dishonest and and I think people will recognize themselves and I think some people will get some new information and people don't change until they get new information\nAnd I think that's the value of what we do\nYou mentioned having worked on a number of August Wilson plates in your career what has that meant to you as an actor and or as a

own words which he himself has done the one man show and and that's really a privilege and an honor to do that to to to sit in that place as a playwright myself if you know what I mean\nYou said you've played it in the number of different cities does it play differently depending on where you are in the country a little bit yeah yeah I mean\nI did it in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh public theatre and obviously that but you know to be August Wilson and in in Pittsburgh can be daunting but it can also be they embrace whatever's him Boston was a wonderful city Atlanta was a wonderful city I Can't think of a single city that wasn't great\nBut certain cities have a relationship with him\nIf you know what I mean that special uh cities where all ten plays have been done you know from the stage I can see heads nodding\nAbout mentioning of street names in Pittsburgh that ... strike in those kinds of course with the with an audience is always nice and you can tell what audiences no what plays

of an idea for a story how do you know that you will be able to turn it into a plane how do you be a playwright it's sort of what the question is which is kind of silly\nI mean again [laughter] or we don't have that much time I you know uh how do I do I my place\nBasically and and not unlike August I've I've taken up the the idea that I'm going to write about Texas and I'm going to write about

very first play which was\nLiving here in New York in between gigs I said I'm not going to wait for the phone to ring up create some work show show yeah the first thing I wrote was was was sort of autobiographical\nAnd a little bit of success with that you know encouraged me to go back at it again and and there have been different uh inspirations for the dozen or so place that I've written I've been inspired by everything from ... from having a meal with my wife\nAnd she suggested a title to a friend of mine losing a mom and then becoming a parent the following week\nIf you know what I mean what that little journey is and what that little character arc was an inspiration for a play so yeah what were they were the ideas come from the characters are all eclectic composites of people from
