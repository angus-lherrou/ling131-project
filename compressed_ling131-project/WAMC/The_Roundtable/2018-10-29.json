crisis in this country it's just that simple\nAllen\nYou know I said look you've what levees are much more articulate Lee that hundred\nA seven forty five this morning I'm\nThe president is largely to blame for giving a what I called a green light mhm or to um to the haters entered the wrist and oil for what all for political or even academic advancement\nIt's it's um it's so depressing it's so it's done and you know we heard on the news this morning from the HDL Anti Defamation league that the um\nThe number of anti Semitic incidents has written about sixty five percent\nIt's MORNING from the age of hell Anti Defamation league that the um the number of anti Semitic incidents has risen up by sixty five percent this year and\nI've been thinking about this that Trump was elected largely by people who thought in many ways that they had been left out and that others were to blame for that\nAnd when that kind of thing happened historically it's always been the Jews who cuss right face this kind of\nTerrible terrible a reaction from the people who feel that they have been left out you know and it's not fair they're for Jews there for people in every sector society uh and and yet and yet\nI'm this guy and Libby is a very tough terms\nBut this guy will be set up all his word monster and I think that that it's appropriate in this case because of what it is getting and his defense was and he said it um well\nYou know he really wasn't a fan of mine because he said I was too close to some of the Jews give me a ... you know a\n... that is that is just beyond anything we could expect from a man sitting in a leadership position\nYou know you know and you're talking about the the number of incidents of the um the the L has has reported in and I was I was talking to a friend of mine who was in uh Los Angeles and has a young two young kids under five\nWho both go to I'm Jewish day school and ah the number of bomb threats than those that that facility that live outside of Los Angeles of receive him last year is on we've we've had them here I Know and you have a presence where you have a there is a\nWell I must have shown on Yom Kippur on the high holy days the Albany police over there right at ... at everything to\nGod Jim I'm going to check in with you too\nYeah you know it's hard to know what to say I actually heard about it after a Saturday evening because we don't listen to the news on Saturday being driven Jews and so to the stunning this of coming out of the the piece that Libya was talking about\nBut you know one of the things that resonated right away was one of his hatred of the Jews was because we were bringing in the aliens because we were supporting the immigrants are there had been many services I mean we are a community that lived through much of that and and many in our community one want to see us not\nUm close the borders we wanna we wanna make it possible for other people to come here and have the kinds of successes we did and uh it was just shocking\nAnd got up I was I spent the weekend in New York City and an immigration conference I'm about I'm\nOrganizing immigration lawyers and creating strategic alliance if we had the Albany county um geography for intend to their um the Brooklyn DA is off at other immigrant friendly law enforcement agencies that sort of collaborate around some of the work that's been done about what words [laughter]\nI I attended a racial justice seminar as part of that I'm In the first part of the conference and a woman sitting behind me and my rv Charlottesville, Virginia\nAnd she grew up there her sister Sophie Shachtman was\nInjured I'm In the\nAttack on the domestic terrorism attack in Charlottesville two years ago um and it talking with her um through the weekend and the conference lasted\nAnd it talking with her\nUm [noise] through the weekend and the conference lasted through Saturday a and making those connections between what the president said after the Charlottesville attacks and one year ago and\nIt just seems like it's been forever um and that that that that statement that he made immediately following that gave license\nTo so much hate in this country ah and yeah to to be at an immigration conference and to see that I'm highest ah ... the organization specifically targeted by this man in his postings\nI'm at a time where the president is also claiming that that that migrant caravan coming up from the south ah contains dangerous people from other countries that are coming here to hurt us when it's when we're hurting ourselves\nA it's almost too much all the pieces together and it's too much\nIt is it really it it feels to I mean after just the bombings last week\nAnd the and the um\nThe not being able to put ... we were um we were down on the air or the arrest happened after we we left the airwaves on friday so we haven't really been talked about that but [noise] you know that you see that van\nRight hand and um and it's you know it doesn't take a I\nI I did you know ... to chuckle a little bit to sadly I'm\nOn friday when the president said you know it's like finding a needle in a haystack and I thought to myself oh my God look at the van out real artist that ... you know it's like\nUm [noise] but the the the the point\nBeing that uh I I I Love Allen's um\nDescription of the green white because of her dog whistle and ... and to me it's a dog whistle it's much louder than that and I think a green light as a a good way of putting up\nBecause it's it it is and as you said at the\nCenter of the license to to um have a\nLife of a and and the the fact\nAnd and the really troubling thing and I think I'm speaking for everyone in this room but I'm not that I mean to but the really troubling thing is\nIs to see this and and to feel\nSo bereft and and so hello and then watch the president the United states go to a rally I'm a pep rally\nIs really very very disturbing and his head and when you know what he ...\nHe said I'm a you know life has to go on a what has to go on you know a morning of these wonderful people that has to go on All right but to go to one of these what we can only call green light rallies mhm that's another whole story well he has no moral compass\nWhatsoever he has no sense he has no conscience if\nThat's clear he used the word global is I think in that rally which is another code word for Jews taking over the world [noise] um I mean they are using all the old tropes regarding anti Semitism in an aunt and and Jews in America I'm not that you can possibly use and you\nKnow I ... to for anybody who doesn't think that anti Semitism isn't\nAnd well and hasn't been alive and well in this country um you're not watching because you've got I mean Adam Schiff put it so well and his er\nBeen alive and well in this country um you're not watching because you've got I mean Adam Schiff put it so well and his article in his statement but you\nKnow I was just going to but but hey you all around the world around them or or maybe ... paid for blacks have for good paper I mean it is is have for anybody\nWho's not white male and Christian or married to a white male Christian I mean I you know that's really it really is it I I kept thinking if\nYou're living all weekend long thank you know really are you are the head of of the major congregation in the capital region um and you know a head responsibility for all of those people who you know who came\nI have one small ... disagreements which is\nA and that if you said he has no moral compass\nYou see I think he does have a moral compass and I think that's what's wrong the moral compass may be corrupted but his moral compass is anything that helps me get ahead is okay and I don't care\nAnd we need to start having that conversation and the the deck of Democrats need to start calling it out more explicitly I think there was um there was a debate where where I'm Down in Florida\nAnd the the deck of Democrats need to start calling it out more explicitly I think there was um there was a debate where where I'm Down in Florida they got the gubernatorial debate where I'm Cinderella credit candidates and I'm not calling my opponent or racist I'm saying that the race is think that he's a racist\n[laughter] and that okay [laughter] I think he's one of them and that's the thing so so Donald Trump is it although he did call himself a national is right so I mean I mean it's just it's so close that that it's in ...\nWhat's happening I think we ought to go back to the\nGermany ... in the Nineteen thirties and say the following thing was there always anti Semitism who we know the answer to this one in Germany there certainly was um and so did it take a Hitler to put the face on it and\nTo give that green light I've been talking about the answer to that is yes and I think that this president is giving that green light so I think that the comparison is apt to this ... mhm\nAbsolutely absolutely [noise] and he's using the same language\nA truly would like to say it's not just the president can we please includes the entire GOP culpability for the environment of hateful rhetoric\nFrom way back when Trump selected was elected as their nominee because he was the best selling their dangerous messaging that means and the humanizes so many\nWe can at least indict them for not being brave enough to get out on the biggest platform that they have and to choose their leadership for Mitch McConnell should be saying something that is right in the absence of a of a leader in the White House [noise]\nWell you know it's a tough one it's a tough one we all have Republican friends and we all know that some of them are very very good people a and a ... and ... we have to understand what this is really all about\nTheir ... there is an economic ruling class in this country\nA these are people who who have done very very well\nAnd they want to keep what they have\nMany of them ... and all of them but many 'cause they're ... Democrats who made a lot of money too\nBut many of them have made a lot of money and this is a defensive posture we want to keep our crowded and we want to keep those other people out who want things you know for the kids or for that and for snap and and the rest of it\nSo yeah you know it is it's tough to say all Republicans are bad people 'cause I don't believe that for a second and neither does anybody else on this panel I Am sure no\nBut the letter writer was talking about the Republican leadership and I think that that is fair right I mean the ... to ... to ... point there had been opportunities that they have had [noise] um and I would argue the Democrats have had many days of this one or two yes\nBut you think about this remembers the campaign when everybody was running for president for\nThe other guys all other people I should say all called him out they called him the most despicable of the apes all accurate\nOr and are they and if they are to be condemned for anything it's for\nShutting up now right I mean after all they were right in everything that they were saying even if some of them have their own issues\nSo so that's what's particularly appalling about that Republican leadership glass\nI mean a week ago or you think of what happened during the campaign [noise]\nThen candidate Trump was basically saying that Ted Cruz's ...\nWe could go by you think of what happened during the campaign [noise]\nThen candidate Trump was basically saying that Ted Cruz's grandfather was father father of the ... was part of the Kennedy assassination\n'em and last week Cruz was on a stage with Donald Trump receiving an endorsement from I mean it's it's a bizarre thing and it says a lot about\nIt says a lot about all all of them they're not willing to stand up to him there's a number of factors one they're getting the policy is an issue if they want ... you know and that day I miss the most important deregulation of everything\nYou know getting rid of roe getting rid of marriage equality that's you know those are the things that are on on the docket but they're spineless and they don't want to be the target of\nTrump's tweets because look at what happens when you are people tried to kill you [noise]\nDays he writes a deer pedal thank you for being here today and someone who has thrown everything I have been getting Antonio de do got elected I Will\nBe devastated if he doesn't win but it's not just because of how much I like Antonio but because of hell hateful the in our accusing me the RMC see has been in reading this idea of him as someone who isn't like us\nTheir latest ad is so gross and once again John ... was not spoken against these ads I Will say so that everything we can ask a couple of times and it is\nAmazingly disgusting I I don't I don't know how um [noise]\nI I didn't think it could top the last one but uh as far as despicable illness is that a word I Will use it when they use it now ah their latest that is so gross and wants to get it on fast as I was a he has encouraged them so a given everything that is going on in this country the hatred that dog whistles\nAnd we'll just feel so wrong in the spirit dispiriting if a John faster when somebody I guess that's a microcosm for what how people feel across the country when it comes to the a ...\nDay and nails pulling seven percent and it's unclear I you know I think that seven percent would probably have gone at least four or five percent would have gone to Delgado and she's just there to pull those votes away she's not there to win\nIt's extraordinary I'm you know if you go back to our debate and it's on line and you're listening to her remarks she hates herself as a liberal yeah yeah\nAnd yet she's going to be the reason mhm if he loses that he lose a and one wonders what's going on I could only say and I said before I'll say it again I I Walk into the green room with ... everybody was preparing the only two people that were there\nWere she any she in John fat so\nUm and um and they read each other if you simply mhm I ...

this assault in Pittsburgh jumpstart the presidential campaign for Michael Bloomberg it is time for a Jewish\nPresident okay\nLynn says this murder has been spewing out his hate on social media for a long time yet the alarm bells were ignored has posed served to energize him and spurred him\nTo more and more extremes when do we learned that the right to free speech does not include a right to a platform for it this is comparable to brown shirts roaming the streets in Berlin harassing people in the street\nThen beating them up why can't we see this in the present\nYou know it's a great place to be the right wing uses freedom of speech is their excuse back on you know we were reading the\n... comment that uh that gab site that we were talking about has been shut down temporarily they claim and they say you know here we are the past year and a free speech and you're shutting us down just because of murder or you know was popularized in what he did on that site so I don't agree with them but that it really is a hard tension and uh\nYou know those of us will create the social media world understand that you have to balance this stuff but it's really hard the numbers are incredible\nYou know what we were on that right what was it five minutes to that would be a two and a half million comments made on Facebook during last five minutes and you're trying to look at the mall and see what are good or bad who judged yeah it's a real\nTough work when all the I mean it is an interesting point though I mean gathered saying that the um so the platform of the people who the app store is and the people where you can sign up for that platform have kicked them off now um and they have to find a new way to get their their message out\nAnd um and as as Jim indicated are saying you know we we stand by free speech and and we want to have a place where people can um can see what's on their mind is certainly not all of the comments on there are um inciting hate\nAnd violence um and certainly as Jim just mentioned him and Facebook and Twitter also have their great\nFear of um ... hatred that drill\nUm so I don't know it is it so that's a very delicate balance and it seems like a real um it

you know I remember reading Eduardo ... biography and you know he had such high hopes for television\nYou know and the the um so the the that tweet um before that tweet or the president said there was great anger in our country cause in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nThe true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news most and\nIf that doesn't put ten those than anybody is buying the fear of God actually it is\nFake news most and and if that doesn't put ten ... than\nAnybody is buying the fear of God actually this is really on believable you know look let's face it not every newspaper is perfect\nOr not every media outlet is perfect\nBut what he's done here is to make sure that any criticism\nOf of of media um is met quite correctly with the kind of resolute feelings that we all have about the importance of the of the first amendment\nAnd I I don't know if you're following by thought here it's a little convoluted but I Do believe that um what he's done is to is to really endanger our American democracy the way he's doing it with the press\nWilling and people have called him ... minutes visually member suppressive called him out on this and say okay give us examples like what what has ... us reporting what is is happening and and the numbers and so what ... what have we gotten wrong [noise]\nUm and uh but it is it's also I mean the hypocrisy coming out of saying that way peace and harmony and we have to um you know ah we have to do much to put out a this this flame of anger\nAnd then I'm four hours prior to that he wrote just watch wacky Tom's Diner who I've not seen an action before\nHe ... he was interviewed by Jake Tapper he comes off as a craze in some way you want it took ... should be running out of money pretty soon as bad as their field is if he is running for president the Dems will lead them alive I mean it's just ... ... and that's our president\nAnd how can he he call mainstream media fake news and then retreat a fringe bizarre Twitter account for\nTennis as soon as a yeah that's a well put that in fact I mean he did that this morning\nAnd that is what Hitler did even though there wasn't an injured it believe me that's what he did\nWell he had ... it's all propaganda one way or the other\n[noise] All right um [laughter] you know it's enough to make me want to just stay in bed [laughter]\nYou're you're right we don't want it and we get we get a better but you're right we do watch\nIt okay um the uh the other thing um\nI Want it to a quickly get to is um I mean ultimately ... there was a article in the New York times this morning 'cause we're talking about all those new just seems like I guess a good place to\nThe end which is we have eight days I'm left and as the New York times writes with ah those days left an already device of election season the campaigns finale is unfolding in ... rounds of finger pointing that reflect the deep fault lines and dozens of competitive house races\nAnd a handful of Senate races nationwide many voters appear to set back politicians from their own parties according to interviews in polling they also often defended or blamed politicians particularly Mr Trump based on the same partisan lines\nAnd I mean obviously a lot can happen in the week we've seen numbers all over the place in just the past week so we can only assume what's going to happen in in the seven days prior to people going to the polls next Tuesday\nWhen we've had unprecedented voter registration drives you can't predict to that kind of thing and I we'd all like I think it's a blue wave well let's see what it is\nUm but it definitely gives me hope um because I I ... in the polls such and they are so close that I have to believe that the energy\nIs is heading in that in favor of justice\nI don't even want to get all that I don't even want to I don't even want to leave led by political\n... is is heading in the in the

the other fifty percent they go into from work or going to be hopefully doing some type of pro bono work throughout their career\nSo I think it's um it's about guiding the students who are trying to

becoming too\nAnd then Larry rooster and then buckled and pancakes were rescued and suddenly we became we realized that there was a movement called the micro sanctuary movement\nWhich is people using the small basis they have to become very high\nUh ethics animal rescues so now ... supporting the growth of the Institute for animal happiness dot com and I want to say that and\nHudson Valley veterans this week and there's a lot of uh animal rescues representing so what's exciting about it is we're sort of helping trying to help ourselves with this event and part of doing this event was\nTo bring everyone together under the same roof and sort of show the Hudson Valley\nIt's not just this one organization here having a vegan event or this one group here look how huge this world is it's the food the clothing the the ethics the social justice components the environmental issues are huge around began his I'm supporting the in his own so\nIf people can we just hope they'll kind of be blown away at how it all in ... and how people\nWho are looking to be empowered in their compassionate choices every day you and me both this is a huge way we can start deconstructing the violent infrastructure that were kind of all taking part in but we don't necessarily understand it right\nIn Joe you know if I mean we're we're going to us like we're going to have a hotter vendors of sort of one or two more of a ... ...\nRight and joke you know if I mean we are we're going to I think we're going to have a hotter vendors of a sudden we have one or two more of a ... son into\nA fourteen speakers educational speakers out to this\nAnd also food demonstrations or what have we had over twenty five hundred a\nAttendees last year and we know that we're going to exceed the number of this year but none of this happens with a disorder and [laughter] I mean she this is heavy lift\nAnd she because of her activism because of her connections in the community\nIn terms of the vendors plant based vendors Reagan voters food vendors and a small businesses that are working really really hard to try to effect change in a positive way a educators uh I mean but it starts here [noise]\nSo we'll just for the for a second Rebecca of ... the was the first event and so what have you learned since then what what do you learn when you do the first one that\n[laughter] [noise] bring the second one into welding I learn increasingly how important it is to represent a diverse amount of voices or\nThat there is no one vegan whites there are incredible people on my wall a a day well a who is coming he's the founder of black veterans in New York City which is an incredible event the highlights the contributions of people of color in the ... movement who have\nA historically not been represented by you know the media that does promote these are issues so it's it's such an honor for him to come or just to really represent we have one cooking demo being done by Alyssa Miller who is death and her\nHer ah organization has definitely vegan\nAnd so this is why I call myself an intersection Ovie again I'm not just begun because for me the key to all of us having a more compassionate world is when we find our commonality and um so I we work really hard we can all do better to try to\nGet anyone who can represent to come and I wish there were more time and more funds to bring even more education I I never get tired of learning from these different speakers shorts\nAnd all of this question to both of you but what type of education do you think is needed\n[noise] I think that for all of us coming into the world we come in with an education at different stages and awareness of each other and we're either\nAdding more layers or trying to peel them away we've all been told that someone else is other and lesser and for one person it may be the animals for someone else and maybe someone's religion or skin color but we we've made an art form out of\nHeavily for to find these battery barriers and\nFor me the the the point of a ... to start deconstructing and going why does that barrier access I mean if you\nIf you care about this person can't you care about the suffering of this animal and and also I I'm a fact based person I'm a science based person a lot of uh animal rights activists I think we're dealing with\nThe stigma of people thinking that we're just cute animal people that that this is science these these are sentient beings they feel they understand pigs have the intelligence and chickens of toddlers\nAnd yet we're subjecting them on math to these horrifying realities a billion\nColleges and chickens of toddlers and yet we're subjecting them on math to these horrifying realities of billions of animals a year and the the pockets of that for peace activists if I if I can say that\nYou know most of us would never want a job in a slaughterhouse or we would never want our daughter or son to do that all day\nEvery day it's dehumanizing it's it's impossible it's an impossible environment\nUm and yet we support these things going on but how do you think that gets on your plate someone's being doing the work somewhere and most of the time they didn't choose to do it very rare person chooses that job\nUm I think there's a reason that all the top animal agriculture uh companies the top um [noise]\nMeat companies and companies are starting to invest in plant based alternatives and began foods and I think there's two reasons for this I think one is the environment is forcing their hand and money is often the bottom line for these massive\nA company for but at the same time\nI think that a certain managerial level is aging out and younger people are coming up through these companies and going I Can't keep that going on on him to ... as people that want and there's more of an audience know we all know with current events as they are\nIt's not just a matter of showing people what's wrong like um I was listening to your earlier this morning and like a lot of animal rights activists could echo what you said that we thought getting video in front of people\nWould change back in the eighties and nineties when my friends were talking about this and we thought off we can only get this on the air you know everybody would be horrified and change and it is surreal to be in a world where facts of what we are witnessing the are being challenged you know\n... to ... I don't know if I could add anything to them but when I wasn't that comes to mind as you know when you think of ... and where to find that it was the ethical and compassionate treatment of all beings and you include the person that as a living organism\nSo um for me what we're trying to accomplish here is to inform and educate\nThrough Hudson Valley about drugs and the Institute and in a phone a compassionate way and and it's a safe space for people to call him a great food a B with community learn an experience this than in a in a fun way so\nIt's the Hudson Valley bitch fest is happening in November third and fourth in Poughkeepsie and just a real quick till about the other than your 'cause it's a\nCool thing yeah it's we love our venue that it it's called the net and gold's gym and it doesn't sound glamorous perhaps but it is this big huge\nAstro turf space the size of re food [laughter] three [laughter] soccer fields and you will be able to wander the aisles spacious and we want community to come out we know we're facing some big issues come out come together this is one other way we can empower each other for more positive things\nYou could bring your WAMC picnic Blanco\n[laughter] people doing surgery a hundred dollar dressed\nA November third am for this coming weekend and they give you can find out all about it was going on our website or you can go to each the village fest ...
