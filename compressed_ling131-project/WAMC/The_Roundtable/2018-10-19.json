I'm sure the Saudis knew there would be a search for the body um you know to provide some clues of evidence and\nTo that extent it seems like they've covered their bases very well by doing and you're performing acts of absolute brutality on this\nSo the the the two ... I'm Sorry onto the show they went through the headlines that are coming out this morning as the Turkish\n... I'm a foreign minister says that they will turn evil share the results of the ... with the world uh they're also\nSaying that it is also believe that they\nUm [noise] the turkey new within within just a hours of um of his death ah that that he was dead so um you know that plays into it as well um I Will go ahead\nAnd of course it tells us that he's ... he's a so heavily bugged that the Turks could come up with this um with this information\nAnd the security tape of the um [noise]\nSomebody as close to um the prince yeah the crown prince\nI NBS as how I've been referring to him right now as but you know his you know so the fact that he has been trying to\nModernize the Saudi economy and you know turn more to you know economics and um you know economic development and looking for a little you know what a slight shift to\nMore democratic political norms are this is a big strike for him is that you know if these are his state of goals now this is probably just the tip of the iceberg of some of the things that are happening was behind the scenes and this really ... it it certainly will not reflect well I'm On\nHim if the you know if you're saying one thing in public and then all of this stuff comes out in private of you know dismembered men and Trump is just you know still walking a\nAbout saying that um [noise] you know\nMaybe the Saudis are responsible and he's just remaining mum on whether or not this goes all the way up to the highest levels of the Saudi Government all ... all\nRise you don't have to I Want to know your bag interests but the ah but the right did I get the district attorney has arrived\nYay [laughter] I I Am very sorry I had a flight last night's in from uh from New Orleans and a\nLate start this morning I Apologize I've been listening with bated breath I just uh there's so many intelligent things are being said I just didn't think I could offer anything to this\nConversation that turned my life for that is the fashion early but unprofessional Elaine\n[laughter] term I liked was baited breath [laughter] yeah there you go and do you want to weigh in on anything on this topic you your thoughts\nAre you know it's it's a pretty this story isn't just a it's not a something that's going to go away um\nUnfortunately I think we're going to continue to see instances where we have there there is a war on truth right now and it's not just here in the United states it's it's all over the world I think if we begin to reflect on\nWhat about Republican lawmakers especially as they go into the last days and the motor\nOkay so we know that the Republican lawmakers know about Trump's popularity with a thirty five percent more than theirs and\nThen comes the profile in courage question\nA and a ... a question and and that is who stands up and says my thinking office is not worth my putting up with is does a John fast so does or the you know at least the phonics through all of these people who are fairly marginal or in terms of their\nPopularity do they get up off their hind legs and do what they need to do which is to say they just ate right and if if it means I lose a primary or I lose an election okay because we're Americans\nYeah I think that ship sailed I don't think the G O P is I mean after\nAfter Charlottesville after uh some of the um [noise]\nYou know sexual assault um allegations came out that you know when you're talking about a journalist in Saudi Arabia I mean I just think that's so far removed from the average person who supports Trump's daily life that it's just a non issue and I I don't want to be cynical about that but like\nWhether it's Republicans you know a handful of Republicans and some Democrats that they push\nFor sanctions on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is the number two producer of X A or number two producer of oil in the world after the U.S [noise]\nUm if Saudi Arabia really wants to go to for tat they could um embargo oil to the u._s. than with their made an OPEC have a much larger embargo of oil which could well yeah raise oil prices and gas prices that's what's going to change the American public's opinion about this\nWell ... well I don't think it's the abstract\nWell this is a journalist you know this is this is a clear day ... amendment and I mean I think when it hits people's pocket book and you see that you know gas prices go up to four or five dollars a gallon because of\nYou know in Saudi embargo um I I couldn't agree with that that that would have in effect\nI could not agree with you more ... and I and I think for the guy on\nThe difference between a Nixon and where we are right now as I think that that in Congress your your Republicans were more of the of the John McCain a strain of Republicans are than they are today as a matter of fact I mean I I've been thinking about\nWhat would what would Senator McCain be doing in this moment in this space as we're witnessing ...\nLike Bob Dole or you know I mean yes the the modern classic GOP not not this weird this is your ... rains and that was the host\nOkay but you both right we don't have one right now right now we have these\nYou know cowardly opportunists yeah that's right ah and so I stopped talking to me about what was\nTaught to me about what is and that by the way is why I feel that the and I think I'm speaking for Allen here that for a radio station I think I Am saying that's why I feel that these elections\nAt least to the house of representatives are crucial I said it before I'll say it again you can love a guy he could be a Republican but he's going to vote for speaking with the Republicans and you have seen that they are absolutely\nAdamant about not holding this president responsible so flipping the house to me seems what it's all about\nOkay so let me ask the follow up question to what you just said which is how then do the Democrats over the next however many days twenty some days for one of a better term capitalize on what is happening right now to uh to score political points\n[noise] well I don't think they have it in other words I don't think they have to do that I think it's ... it's being done by the press is being done it before them you know you can say has I opponent feel about this and if I'm a smart opponent I say well I don't like it [laughter]\nYou know you know you just get on that fire too though because if yeah I mean so the one\nThe most obvious channel to respond to this from Congress whether it's Democrat or Republican is imposing sanctions on Saudi Arabia in one form or another\nThey are our main out or at least with the Trump Administration our main ally in the Mid East especially because of their\nStance on Iran and we all know where Trump stands on that um but you know if Democrats want to push through sanctions and Saudi Arabia response by saying\nOkay we're going to an embargo um oil shipments to the U. S. that can really backfire for Democrats because then everybody blames higher gas prices and higher heating costs going into the winter on Democrats to push through these sanctions\nAre no profiles in courage being done on Democrats I'm Sorry I I'm a I woke up this morning at a cup of coffee ... but I I Will say that this party is just feckless is feckless you know uh\nA cup of coffee and some hater rate but I I Will say that at this party is just feckless is feckless you know a a campaign on Democrat\nDemocrat I'm Talking about Democrats\nAnd the idea that they could sit back not say anything not do anything because the press is doing it for them\nWell let's look at the press cycle this story might be wiped off the front page today with something else that happens that may not be favorable for purposes of a of the mid term so this idea that you're not in session right now working in proposing possible\nHearings on the issue but also I'm Talking about sanctions it's just absurd\nI Will you make a very good point David and I'll tell you why because we know that the Democrats excuses well we don't own the house and therefore we don't have the ability to pull a election or we don't have the ability to coal hearing for hearings and stuff\nBut they can of course they can have their own wrote the hearings anytime de la it'll get all the press coverage and I've said it before I've always considered Chuck Schumer the friend\nBut where the hell is he in all of this stuff\nHe should be some money should be leading the charge you is that party and ... just hadn't done that it is it's not good uh by the way I I Would just counted the Democrat taking the how they set it also then this is going to be very unpredictable which\nIndeed um okay I'm gonna do one more water and then we're going to have to go actually I'll finish up butters and then we'll go to a quick break or\nThe\nJim Wright's can the panel explained to me why Saudi Arabia has never paid a price for providing a\nQuote unquote providing the majority of the nine eleven terrorists as to the point you were making earlier and I believe they also finance them as well on some level we attacked the country that provided a safe haven for them and bin Laden also Saudi and no one has ever demanded a consequence this is true of both Republican and democratic administrations Jim from gum\nYeah because we have accepted the lie and the lie is those are bad Saudis those were good salaries\nThey these were the bin Laden he was out of out of a kilter with the the worst family in in Saudi Arabia in terms of the the ... the ruling class and therefore we let them off the hook and we let them go by played at the last ... I'm Sorry\nNo that's fine um but you know there's overwhelming evidence and the the the nine eleven report the Congress and buried somewhere between pages like four hundred and thirty in four hundred and fifty about\nPretty conclusive evidence that funding for a lot of these terrorists going back to that you know I mean ... well before the nine eleven attacks came from the highest levels of\nThe Saudi Government and\nIf that doesn't trigger a severe response to Saudi Arabia the death of one journalist is not going to have any Aaron Aaron that's why it was hit in between four thirty six and for the you know I I mean I I totally understand that but this is Congress is I mean this is what Congress people are supposed to do is read the report and say okay\nThere's evidence to there's evidence about this we need to do send ... enrolled quite let's attack Afghanistan because we also\nHave this letter from heroine who says so much for never forget on Web and apparently drop us forgotten the fifteenth of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia here's hoping transparent investigation isn't code for the superficial look see that happening in the cabinet\nOf August ... my old contracts professor used to say a there are fewer things as dark and yet so full of subtle difficulties\nWhen we were discussing a complicated issue around ... buffet of democracy you know he he memorized the fact you know the middle east brighter to a lack of his car next to I used in foreign policy with respect to the middle east is a very\nStoop and so\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to Todd walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nVital ally in that region of the world I just don't see that happening and they didn't do it when nine eleven happened because you had the growing threat of Iran you also had issues around ... involved in Syria and when you're talking about foreign policy sometimes you just have to\nUm you just have to overlook some of the things that your allies are are doing a for the purposes of maintaining greater peace and I believe that was what the the philosophy was then I don't know what that will be now\nWell if you I mean historically whether or not a you know politicians memories go back this far that when a U.S supported Israel and the report or Nineteen Seventy three\nThe oil embargo led to inflation going from four or five percent over ten percent within the span of a couple of months there is gasoline rationing it led to one of the most uh depressed economic decades in us history outside of the great depression\nUm there are consequences in terms of the the economic role that oil plays in this and\nRepeating that can be very very costly and that is put on the politicians who plays put those sanctions in place um that's on their watch at this point\nAnd I don't know why don't you believe so why aren't you believe that if we had an oil embargo ... first of all our repetition the world is better than it used to be to be a V. gum um oil\nBut if we added oil embargo wanting one makes two and the electorate would say okay these are the people in a whole responsible for this or is it something more and more fish than that\nNo way I I think they would blame it on politicians are saying well you put the sanctions in place these sanctions are causing higher oil and gas prices and heating costs\nUm and oils and input everything so it's not just gas and you know heating fuel it's ethics plastics um package delivery because you know a UPS and FedEx price of airline tickets um no I think it would be very hungry I don't think it would be amorphous at all\n[noise] All right let's take a break when we come back we'll continue we have other topics to talk about I'm sure we'll have more letters as well panel at WAMC Dorjee panel at WAMC dot org we will be back right after this\nSupport for WAMC comes some nature works organically had care specializing in innovative ecological landscape construction of outdoor living spaces landscape design installation and maintenance nature works land care dot com\nHancock shaker village a place to explore the legacy of the shakers heirloom gardens historic buildings are Tesla festivals farm to table dining concerts and he lost Hancock shake her village dot org\nAnd Albany marry a wolf wrote Albany New York newly renovated hotel was flexible meeting space and features such as in ... entertainment system mobile check into more Albany Mariette dot com\nThis is Northeast Public radio WAMC F.\nM.

particular subject so I'm going to go through these as fast as I can and then we'll move on to some other stuff Dave rights there's simply no evidence to suggest Trump would lift a finger to assist an adversary on the contrary there's much evidence indicating that even\nGiven if given the opportunity he'd relish the chance to bury one\nGiven his animas toward the Washington Post coverage of him in the post owner Jeff Bezos I'm afraid we must expect Trump to take advantage of the show you situation relishing the opportunity to send a chilling message to journalists and their outlets\nCritical of him expect a little more than lip service if you've been that from him for protecting journalists and freedom of the press will set\n[noise] we go to James who says enemy of the state the murder of the Saudi journalist doesn't faze Trump's base because he was a journalist and by Trump's definition an enemy of the state or the people as was the the proper quote isn't this just a logical extension of his attack on the media Allen [noise]\nWell it certainly could be seen that way uh Joe I'm a it is an attack on the media all souls together I think what people say stupid if he doesn't know anything or it's done and intellect\nThey forget one thing that if he's the president of the United states played with these very tactics that got 'em they're preaching to the same crowd I think it's despicable but that's what got them there and if he thinks that by the way we have seen polls about what people think about the press they don't like it\nThey you know their uncle Irving as they misspelled in the in the paper they paid it forever as a result of that\nSo you know they're very very low in the ... the very very low in the polls lower the Congress I Believe so he knows what he's doing he's he's going after them because he thinks it'll help them that's the kind of many as\nYou know your praise or congressmen who body slams a reporter that's what you do exactly and you and your tone desk because you don't even recognize that you're praising this man in the context of what's happening right now and the ...\nIn the in the presser that he did the other day uh you know somebody asked him a perfectly legitimate collection he's sending the FBI and on the ... the show that they are and the illness\nYou know somebody asked him a perfectly legitimate collection he's sending the FBI and on the ... thing and he won't answer he won't answer it finally turned around to the reporter to watch I tell you [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah I tell you why should I tell you and it was that was a weird wrist or if there was a weird exchange all the way around or Mike right answer ... question where is the profile in courage among Republicans there is no such animal with today's Republicans they sold their soul to Donald Trump and they're not going back or they're not going to buck him besides I think they're afraid of\nI think what's causing this and this is just speculation as with all talk about the stock market is that I think you're starting to see a reversal of the over optimistic psychology that started when Trump took office of here we have a you know a pro business president he's going to pass a big corporate tax cut that's going to boost corporate earnings\nIt's it's gonna you know growth is going to explode\nTwo days ago um the ... uh the congressional budget office reported that the trait that the federal budget deficit was the largest it's been in six years African filled out well\nOut of control during an expansion when the economy's doing good you normally don't need giant tax cuts and massive ramp ups in federal spending so I think\nI'm investors are concerned that without getting into the details when you have a rising federal budget that\nSo I think I'm investors are concerned that without getting into the details when you have a rising\nFederal budget deficit when the economy's doing well that pushes up interest rates and when interest rates go up investors move out of stocks into bonds and that's exactly what you're saying because that's where the um you know the higher asset returns are so I think a lot of what Trump's doing and has done is starting to um\nI think he shot himself in the foot by trying to do too much and that could be inflationary and cause people to kind of scale back there um investments and equity markets the other thing to point out about the stock market is that\nThe richest one percent of the population owns half of all stocks the richest ten percent of the population owns Ninety percent of all stuck so when you're talking about a drop in stock prices even when you include people's retirement funds you're really talking about people earning mid six figures and up\n[noise] I I Want to go to a billion exposition is why we're so lucky to have you with us Aaron I'm but I Want to go to the Chinese side there's a little bit of a\nDivide in their heads obviously the leadership heads on the one hand they say oh we're going to build violins we're going to protect them we get to your show a muscle and um and on the other hand we have to be part what's brought us all this way and you're right on the money you're airing\nIs the relationship between us and the other world\nA so they have on the one hand it's sort of militaristic thing er and sometimes cheating saying and on the other hand they gotta play ball and they and from those that and Trump has said okay I got more muscle than you do and I am ... to punish you and I'm going to make you into the Boogie Man\nI'm here are and the Chinese are in a tough spot yes\nYes they are um [noise] but I don't think it's tough is a lot of people think because um\nChina owns that that it's common knowledge at this point about the amount of US government debt that the Chinese hold and um\nThey have some leverage it's not just about the important ... which side of the story about what we import more from China than they import from us therefore are terrorists will be more damaging to their economy I don't think either country wants to trade war and I think investors are starting to see that well if it can happen with the world's largest trading partner in China\nWho's next and then what what random feud as Trump going to pick the single out um I don't know Brazil or some other country\nThe truth the truth of the matter is two thousand a team with the economies of the world being so inextricably intertwined no one should be rooting for the decline or to the demise of any economy because it's going to write somewhere along the production line\nIt's going to impact on something that we as Americans consume\nRight and you know interestingly the\nSo far the effect that Trump's bluster on tariffs and threatening to discontinue to ramp them up is actually really beneficial to China because as I'm\nAs Joe pointed out that the Chinese you on the their their currency is a decreasing in value\nWhich makes goods that the Chinese exports to other countries cheaper [laughter] so if he wants to go this route he's actually helping the Chinese stimulate their economy by other sources of foreign demand\nChina doesn't just export their goods to the U.S there's lots of other countries that buy Chinese goods if the Chinese currency is going down that is a huge external stimulus for the Chinese economy independent of what Trump wants to think and what his intend to plans for the terrorists are so I'm\nTrump's already handed the the the Chinese or a major win and\nStreaming support

implementation of the Marshall Plan is that you know when you're investing in building other nations are also investing in their future I think that the the the near sighted um\nFolks who believe we

democracy test one of the great innovations of the American constitution is a testament of checks and balances each branch of government can apply a break on the others in particular Congress and the courts are supposed to check the power of the president\nBut the president is gathered more and more power over the last Seventy years and we now have a president who attacks Congress and the judiciary when it suits them and mouse almost daily assault on other institutions that can hold them to account the media and the career professionals and federal agencies like the FBI and the Justice Department\nLater this hour we'll hear about the erosion of the informal unwritten rules that can lubricate the machinery of government they're often called norms and we'll look to the lessons of Watergate were checks and balances worked but we begin with the formal set of checks and balances written into the constitution\nE.J Dionne it's a well known commentator and columnist for the Washington Post he's also a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institute a government professor at Georgetown and a visiting professor at Harvard his most recent book is one nation under Trump which he wrote with Thomas Mann and norm ... he joined us from Cambridge\nEgypt we're looking at the workings of democracy in this series and central to that our checks and balances and US government I think you described as the genius of the constitutional system how are they supposed to be working\nWhen the founders for together the constitution they did not assume the existence of political parties\nAre that's odd it away because the constitution itself creative what you might call the first party system federalist and edgy federalist but they did not assume that the branches would be affected by party loyalty I think what you're seeing in this period since Trump's election\nIs a Republican Party that has largely decided not to play\nWe're seeing in this period since Trump's election\nIs a Republican Party that has largely decided not to play it's traditional role in Congress that the Congress rather than being a check on the president is choosing to support him in the courts particularly the lower courts\nWe're going to see if the Supreme Court proves to be a check their reasons to doubt that\nThe biggest check we do have is not so much in the constitution although as part of the constitution it's in the larger acceptance of small D democratic values and the country\nShowed the checks or outside the government both in political mobilization which is happening in a big way in the country and also in a free media which is doing a lot of the investigating that Congress isn't doing\nI think one of the things we forget when we used to go back to the Watergate period\nIs that in Watergate you had all of the institutions working in tandem to hold the president accountable the courts played a critical role in this\nCongressional investigations played a critical role in this for a member of that the Congress was controlled by Democrats and obviously the media played a critical role now you are missing important pieces in that system of checks and balances and I think we are so far see the outcome\nNo need to pull no need to tag walk your dog with love thousands every these at my dog hunt S. dot com\nIt's in our governing institutions as such it may be in part in the media and immediate system\nWhere there is less of a common narrative\nThat people broadly share and then to argue within it now there are not only sort of narratives about facts themselves that are contested across political lines and you know there is some evidence that search algorithms\nPush us into our own little camps now that can be exaggerated but I Do think\nThat the nature of our conversation now is different and I don't want to romanticize\nThe past you can argue that online media have opened up the political system to all kinds of points of view and that in the old system there might have been too much of a leak control I can see that argument but I think the lack of any kind of common agreement on a set of facts\nMixed political argument much more difficult\nBecause if you at least you agree on facts you can argue about what to do about them if you don't agree on facts anymore then there's almost no way to carry on a coherent argument and I worry that that's the direction we're going in\nEgypt tapes to me you're describing a system we're certainly the Republican Party in increasing we both parties are interested more in part is an advantage an idiom logical purity as you describe it how do we get back to a system where there are at least in crises more interested in the national interest\nKnow there's an interesting case and it's a very controversial one where partisanship did disappear for a moment of crisis\nAnd that was the bank bailout back in two thousand eight and the irony there is the bank bailout was called for by President Bush all Republican the bulk of the votes for the bail out came from Democrats in Congress they didn't much like it either\nBut there was a feeling that in the middle of this crisis when the entire economy could collapse if this didn't happen no matter what injustices might be involved in the bank bailout\nThe damage to everyone would have been worse so we at least have some occasions when we come together we also came together in a remarkable way obviously after nine eleven when President Bush's\nApproval rating rose to the eighties or nineties some argue that that strong consensus actually became a problem because we in adequately debated the Iraq War\nAfterward I Would note that in both of those cases it was largely Democrats went over to the other side and said All right we're going to support Bush even though we didn't like this and after nine eleven there was a decision made that we wanted to unite behind our president who many Democrats\nDisagreed with I'd like to think that would be good is circumstances like that when Republicans would do that for a Democratic president I just haven't seen that in recent years I'd like to believe that it's true the one clear example on the other side is when um Syria across President Obama's red line\nThe beginning of a second term in using chemical weapons it is true that John Boehner the speaker and Eric Cantor the number two Republican supported President Obama but there was so much opposition in the Republican Party and as well as the Democratic party that there was no agreement

in that way\nWell and that goes back to what you're saying earlier about Congress sort of dropping the ball pushing back on the president the whole concept was the three branches of government would be very concerned about their own power and so they would constantly push back against each other so when any one of them gets week we're starting to work for the others were kind of in trouble\nRight

of two thousand sixteen and we wrote that piece thinking about the rise of populism thinking about the concept of a of a new gilded age and\nThinking about very very close and very vocal party competition those were the things that we were really thinking about there in terms of parallels just try and get flush out the idea of is there really anything that has happened before one\nThing I Would say about that pieces I kinda think back on it as did a lot of the conceptualization of that paper and twenty Fifteen in early twenties sixteen so I kind of cringe to think about how it does or doesn't apply after the\nElection well okay what are you calling for there was that you argue in it that in the Eighteen nineties as well as in the present you have parties that are very evenly matched the ballot box\nThey appear to many voters to look pretty much the same and they are incredibly vitriolic and what you suggested about that period is that in the Eighteen nineties it is it that was the precursor to an entirely different parties system\nAnd I'm Wondering if you would say the same today in two thousand and Eighteen looking at where the parties are in those particular parallels\nI thought a lot about this and a lot about the possibilities for a change in ways that are not I don't I don't know they're totally reflected in in that piece and there are two things that I keep coming back to one is that our current situation is a recipe for very stale and stagnant parties\nIt's very difficult for the parties to change\nNegative partisanship makes us just I'm very resistant to third parties and I know it's not normally we hear from political scientist right political science doesn't tell you that\nHaving electoral college and single member congressional districts majority ... majority rule makes it that's why we don't have their party\nBut third party is bubble up periodically and American history and\nThey take up ten percent twenty percent\nOf the vote in a presidential election and they kind of changed the agenda right they don't win office but they they changed the agenda and they channel\nNew ideas and that really I think strikingly hasn't really happened in the twenty first century\nAnd I think one reason for that is that negative partisanship makes people terrified to cross the aisle it means that elite don't both their parties at the same rate that they used to to to start new ones\nYou know that may be good or bad in various ways but I think it makes the party system very stagnant and you don't see the same possibilities for change that you did through the Eighteen nineties and then the early part of the the twentieth century you know you had different factions and in both parties that were kind of\nPushing back against the established institutional structure is pushing back against the shape of the gilded age political economy things like that um that's you know kind of what I see in terms of the possibilities for change them\nGilded age political economy\nThings like that um that's you know kind of what I see in terms of the possibilities for change the only thing I think that\nIn political science we've maybe moved away from some of the theories that would explain how we get out of these periods of close competition and vitriol and stagnation we used to call them ... minutes we used to say All right the new majority formed around new issues and there was this\nElection in which that happened\nRealignment degree has kind of fallen out of favor in political science in part because when you do scrutinize those election patterns a lot of the claim start to crumble but we haven't replaced it with anything in terms of a big kind of idea about\nHow we get out of those periods so how you get from\nFrom Eighteen Ninety six to Nineteen thirty to for example\nWe've referred several times in this conversation to your colleague Jennifer Smith [noise] ah she died this past August much too young we're sorry for your loss and ours\nThank you Julia sorry thank you for being with us Julia it's already teaches political science at Marquette University and thanks for being here thank you how much\nThe one moment in American history that may bashed in body the principle of checks and balances is Watergate a free press the courts and Congress all acted to bring down a president who transformed the White House into a criminal conspiracy\nBeverly gage has another theory yes the Washington Post judge Johnson reckon Senator Sam urban all played important parts\nBut she believes that the standard Watergate narrative overlooks another key player the federal bureaucracy specifically\nThe Federal Bureau of investigation that really gauge teaches twentieth century American political history Yale and she's the author of the new book gee man J Edgar Hoover and the American century she joined us from New haven welcome to the democracy test\nThanks for having me really it's easy to think of J Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon it's political allies comrades an anti communist fervor but you argue that they were in fact in deep conflict\n[noise] they were both at the same time so they had in fact spent by the time Nixon became president spent a lifetime or at least since the late forties in a pretty close friendship and political alliance\nThat that was built as you say around anti communism and also around kind of shared outlook about Washington so they liked each other quite a lot\nOf 'em they conspired together about all sorts of things including you Hoover really supported Nixon being elected in Nineteen sixty eight though he did it quietly but once Nixon became president they came into conflict pretty quickly\nUh one of the things Nixon really wanted to do when he came to office was what he called politicized the bureaucracy uh he felt that all sorts of federal civil servants were not nearly as responsive to the president as he would like them to be they didn't serve his political purposes\nAnd he really wanted to do that unfortunately J Edgar Hoover wanted no such thing and he was a pretty powerful man at that point and that brought them into some serious conflict\nHoover himself died just before the Watergate break in right he did\nSo Hoover died in May of Nineteen Seventy two and the Watergate break in happened in June of Nineteen Seventy two all ready before that the FBI had had some pretty serious showdowns with\nThe Nixon White House over some of the some of the elements that ultimately led to Watergate so for instance Nixon really wanted the FBI to be doing some of his political investigating\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com and no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans
