thinly veiled anti\nSemitic ... wolf whistle man ... wolf whistle [laughter] yeah yeah and not just a dog whistle yeah and you know I I think um I I think in the wake of Pittsburgh\nIt bears for all of us to pay close attention to the ways in which those dog whistles are wolf whistles are being used not only kind of somewhere else in the country but even at our own communities who's using them who's saying these sorts of things\nUh who's supporting them in saying those sorts of things I I I I'm I really find myself in the end being quite angry about this\nThe ... the smell of attacks that the president doesn't invoked during the campaign and even in the first day of his administration and things that he would a tweet and say and re tweet\nDuring the campaign and even in the first day of his administration and things that he would a tweet and say and re tweet that were\nUm that were\nBig enough that he could deny knowing what they meant and yet we're seen by many as to be and his mother um and the question is I mean to Alan's point how much of that um\n[noise] so does the seeds of of this type of hate\nOn top of the the platforms that this particular individual was um\nWas using um where where frankly a lot of the information and a lot of the things that that uh had become mainstream because of again I say the early days of the ministry of things a lot of it was Steve Bannon right or that that a lot of that came from my correct on that\nI suppose I don't think he's the only one though no he's not feel yeah no but but I Know there were some it was it might is widely believed for ya okay so um and that that so we see that being used that it seems it doesn't seem that far of a stretch to make that connection than we used to be able to ask the question\nOf okay well what does one have to do with the other well\nIt's so interesting because their defense inevitably is that the president's daughter and son in law are are Orthodox Jews and his grandchildren and his ... and they say that again and again and again and yet\nThere are those of us who can understand as a gym and said the the the dog whistle or the wolf whistle as I have said um understand that this is an attempt I Believe they have it both ways\nYeah go I wholeheartedly agree with you that the rhetoric ... without this rhetoric that massacre would not have happened in Pittsburgh but I also believe that\nOur whole society is responsible in some respects because\nWhenever you know we all encounter people who are biased and and ... and you really need to stand up to them and have that conversation\nRather than all I don't want to get into an argument I'm going to walk away I used to I think we need to as a society really embrace this problem and each and every one of us talk about it and and try to educate the people who are biased like this\nAgree I think I think we as a society need to be intolerant of this kind of\nA behavior by people and these expressions by people and we have to constantly call it out I I I think that's that's right I mean it'd be easy for one political side to blame President Trump's rhetoric certainly it certainly hasn't helped and and\nYou know um it's on unknown just exactly what motivated this guy in Pittsburgh where there's a guy down in Florida to send out the bombs but but it it certainly the atmosphere\nOr that to foster that kind those kinds of hateful lax and and\nAnd and the amazing thing to me is that just as this is unfolding the president is complaining that the news media isn't doing its job\nRepublicans and you're doing so well in early voting at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on I mean basically\nDoesn't realize that the news media goes after the news and this is a horrific news that that is is just dominated ... you know the airwaves in in the pages of newspapers in in the Internet because it is so important\nEven he recognizes that by trying to um\nYou know the airwaves and and the pages of newspapers and and the Internet because it is so important even he recognizes that by trying to um you know go in and and be a leader and demonstrate his a potential to be a leader by going up Pittsburgh\nWho might you don't you think that's because the ... his numbers are in a precipitous refill right now in one week he lost four percentage points on but he lost it from the highest he's been since he's been in the oil yeah on the other hand he was doing OK but now that he's not doing OK\nEr and er it is um it is um\nAmazing you say well that may be why he's going out to Pittsburgh\nBut it also may work against him I mean I think there are plenty of people who are just furious when the guy who they blame\nFor having set the tenor of the country is going out there and now pretending in a pie is sort of way or you know that he's there to heal when he's been pretty obvious and pretty honest about not wanting to heal but to divide\nDriven [noise]\nYeah I I certainly think the president deserves a significant amount of blame for the atmosphere of the crew and the country or do also think that that the media has a has turned into really just a twenty four hour shouting match on Fox News or MSNBC CNN [noise]\nAnd on Twitter and a couple of weeks ago are deleted my Twitter up off my phone and I've never been happier [noise] um and uh so I Do think that the media shares and the blame I don't think that they share more in the blame it dropped by the Trump really you know should go on a tour of the blame the media certainly does\nSharing the flame there's overheated rhetoric every single day every tweet and I think the saddest thing\nIs that our country's going through this really tough time the media focuses not on the issues and the event but on Trump's reaction to the event it's Trump said that Trump tweeted this\nI got to agree I mean you know I really agree with\nYou I mean how you can eat Quaid the way the president has behaved to the media the media is job is to be the credit gets to be critical and to analyze and report what's going on I Know there are pundits will appear on cable news channels you have that kind of rhetoric but the but the media in general\nYou can't attribute this to them well I didn't\nQuite I said Trump deserves more ... but I think the media\n... to the the the media environment\nIn this country when you turn on Fox News and CNN and um it's NBC and MSNBC every single night is shouting notes the Democrats' fault no it's the Republicans' fault and well\nWell you're looking at a very hairy and you know you're right you're looking at the at the cable news networks that are the logical well rather than\nThe media will look look look look look ... like the friend and you are dear friend and I know that you brought me a yoga blog\nGet rid of it yeah right [laughter] but I never know when he started way\nYou are but but you know there is such a thing as right and wrong here and wrong is what the president of the United states has done to this country it's just terrible\nAnd um it's a false equivalency to say they're all yelling at each other when a when you know Mike is defending the press I don't want to even go there and you know the presses the press is the first amendment right in this country is sacrosanct as far as I'm concerned but\nHe is a guy who says that he purposely does if he admitted he says it in speeches he's a bad man\nHe certainly does and the media the only person that benefits more from Trump's rancid rhetoric the only\nShe certainly certainly does and the media\nThe only person that benefits more from Trump's rancid rhetoric the only group that benefits more from his rats rhetoric and his atmosphere is created is the media who profits on it and focuses incessantly on every single thing but what is the alternative\nTo that I I mean I think it becomes a focal point because there is there is great misunderstanding as to what is happening for example the president yesterday\nTweets early in the morning that the once again saying that the press is the enemy of the people are that none of this would have happened if it weren't for the press and uh the media has to stand up to bring in this country together then I'm as if planned\nRe tweets a a an article by the national Sousa for God's sakes\nAnd I'm a man who he pardoned earlier this year my question to you then is how does that if the media starts and your words and I understand what you're saying I'm not ... [laughter] you know in the in the media starts screaming about that I think it's out of just some sort of incredulous\nWell how why let's look at this as as an ...\nSo what I Would say is if the media is goal is to educate everybody and said these are the news events that are happening and this is how the president is reacting to those what has happened to that to to Trump into the media over the first year and a half is trust in the media is at an all time low\nWhen you don't have to have an excuse to file an absentee ballot in most in New York you have to have just a limited number of excuses and ... and you you know what about people who work during the day you know and who have children and they have to drop them off at school and daycare pick them up get them home at the end of the day\nFeed them get them to bed at ... I mean some people just have difficulty voting in that window that recall election\nDay I'm not against that I Would have asked me right and I would also say that so I've worked on many elections around the world I've been in many countries that we're having their very first free and fair election and it's always really moving to see people turn out\nUm for the first time in their lives for for a vote that matters and that always just reminds me of how so few Americans vote for whatever the reason is some of it is are these logistical issues that we're talking about some others that many people just feel completely\nUh checked out from from the system but I Will die for that right I yes I've been in countries where that is happening mhm\nLet's go to the letters Oh thank you Joe I'm Kevin says none of this would have happened without the widespread use of social media as a vehicle to the antisocial anti civil fringe to have a sense of community of like minded loners who sometimes coalesce but now recently act as lone wolves\nI completely agree social media can be a very classic and firemen and is\nIt is unbelievable what people will say you know it's interesting when um people will say a lot of things on social media but he actually talked to them face to face it they're not they back right on a Mac right off the June ... how would you solve that problem\nAt ... you know there are there is lots of social media said this get there is the monitoring that Facebook and Twitter are trying to do but then it's just driving a these are fanatics into these other streams like this gab or that became incredibly tactic but you know\nWe also had these free speech people should be able to see what they want to say\nTo a point you know went oh yeah okay okay I sat right there was the point when they incite violence I think than it needs to be checked\nOkay so I've said some pretty provocative things this morning by inside it up islands you know ... well the ... ... feet don't you see that that's the issue that that there is a\nIs a fine line here that people have to have to say I don't think of that final why\nI think it's more about civility and society and I agree with Julie people\nFace to face or not nearly as in Bolden is when the city the keyboard or punch way on the phone they feel\nThey feel like they can you know they're heroes they can call people out they can shame people for whatever they want but but you know and that's one of the characteristics of social media to let you do this sort of like feels like it's anonymous but it isn't in in uh\nIt it it can be damaging and we just haven't learned as a society how to manage it and put it in its place\nIf somebody calls you out on social media don't take it's a personal there's a lot of wacky people left\nOut of high I ruined my country and I was in my solution has been to delete it from your phone you're going to be happier if you do not engage in social media but we we\nCan see that the attacker in Pittsburgh was parroting the language that he's hearing in the broader political neurons in talking about\nA invaders coming across the border using the language of regarding the care of or the caravan right um I don't I Can't recall if he has been but I Know many others have been saying back to the Georgian\nRegarding the care of or the caravan right um I don't I Can't recall if he has been but I Know many others have been saying back to the George Soros issue that George Soros is funding these invaders who are coming across this border that we need to harden the border and it's a national emergency you know this is the language of\nOf war does it specifically incite violence\nPerhaps not but it certainly draws on language and that could inspire someone to join in these communities on line and um and we can see a track record of this particular person having used that exact language\nHe called out that Hebrew immigration organization right specifically and that is the organization that's been around I mean for for decades they were the group that would help the juice that would come in ... from Nazi Germany during the thirties and get set up and they\nThey they they have a long history of helping people get established when they come from a horrible situations and immigrate to this country and and you know\nIt now anybody who helps people and you know I I Know Joe you'll probably get into it I mean the whole idea of just tape targeting the immigrants wherever they are they don't they're not us it's just not a so pervasive you know okay a media versus Trump I agree with Jay themes that the media should\nBe more could be more savvy about handling Trump but it's not the media's fault that they have Trump is president report on blaming the media for the division Trump's ...\nFeels like shooting the messenger also police split Fox in excluding ... Smith in a different category that other news organizations thanks always for a great show and that's from Chris\nWell for you know I don't know I I mean I think you you certainly can put them in a different um box because they're conservative but I mean to Jay peas earlier point which I Do agree with when you watch some of the programs\nThere is a there is an ideology and a and his Larry hysteria and a flip and say that certainly equals now\nThe the paddling of now the difference I Would I Would maintain um the the the difference to me is the paddling in conspiracy theories which Fox seems to be much better at an certainly much per se way better in the sense that they do it more often\nUm and I don't see that on the other networks as much as my though and it's certainly there it's it's certainly\nWe'll wait wait wait but don't you think that the people\nAt Fox are bought and paid for in other words they're actors who brought on to Fox in order to say what they're with their owners want now there'll be somebody who writes it says well what do you think's going on and MSNBC that that's that's what they're looking forward to\nBut I see a hell of a difference between what happens at Fox and happens in these other places\n[noise] where are you know Fox does encouraging attract people who share the ideology of the philosophy of the Fox network\nMSNBC seems to bring on more getting away from some of their daytime shows where they just seem as you describe Joe I'm they they do\nAt times bring on a very very good set of people who are journalists and writers and politicians who talk a lot about the different things they might argue with them but it's\nIt's it's not as bad I guess is what I'm okay fair enough\nFair enough and returning to the letters than Russell says I'm a the quote media is speaking for us the people who furiously disagree with what the ... is saying and doing every single morning noon and night with that\nUh the quote media is speaking for us the people who furiously disagree with what the ... is saying and doing every single morning noon and night without the media we would be living in something approaching a dictatorship\nAnd then we heard from Richard who said lane Trump I agree with Alan Trump is dangerous Trump as a bully pulpit is ... ... constant lives are enabled by Fox News the other media calling out his speech in behavior nameless continuing that's Rick from Amherst okay and I'm an egg Kerry and says\nOne grand achievement of the Trump Administration is to stoke division he's a master at it just listen to your cells this morning\nA ... a ... I mean the intensity Jewish leadership where is the national Jewish leadership in calling out the cabinet and administrative staff that are Jewish for not standing up to Trump's behavior\nAnybody I read it again\nI mean we get a does anyone think silent is that correct I haven't you also look at someone like Netanyahu I remember in the ... said there's no greater friend to the Jewish people into Israel than President Trump beyond what what is the Yahoo story about about these recent about I don't know how effective these comedy I I Do uh I recall that\nThe Israeli government is sending 'em ministerial level representative is probably already here in the U.S I think there's a minister did they ask for something like that and they've come they\nAlso do where these has nothing to do with Israel but that the the the Muslim organizations in the in Pennsylvania have raised a tremendous amount of money in the wake of this I'm\nOn the question of Netanyahu is would\nWould Netanyahu have a private conversation with Trump about this ... is that somebody that Trump would actually listen to on this subject um I think it is somebody that Trump would listen to I'm not sure that Netanyahu would be willing\nTo jeopardize this relationship um over this issue ...\n[noise] All right let's take a break we'll come back we'll go back to ... when we return we welcome yours panel at WAMC Duterte we'll\nBe right back after this support for WAMC ... seeded are mythology providing governmental logic and medically focused skin care to the capital region Hudson Valley and surrounding areas since Nineteen Ninety five when it comes to getting this practices in T.

I can see that as late at night\nWe [noise]\nDon't you invade\nYeah hang up\nOnly around\nThe\nGood morning welcome back to the roundtable into our panel discussion at this morning very nice to have you with us there's a new poll out this morning from Monmouth University regarding the nineteenth congressional district\nOf course this was the ... one of the most watched congressional races and all the United states of America\nIn this latest poll democratic candidate Antonio Delgado has increased his lead over first term Congressman John fast so according to the poll forty nine to forty four percent over fast so among likely voters using modern standard mid term turnout model\nAnother three percent support a third party I Believe the breakdown is two percent for Diane Neal one percent for the Green Party candidate or um [noise] uh and four percent in this poll are under Stott undecided\nThis is where I don't understand and I'm Mike perhaps you can help me here\nThe race stands at fifty one percent for Delgado and forty three percent professor using a model that incorporates a turnout surge in democratic precincts similar to the turnout dynamic scene in special elections held over the past year I Will turn out to her now mean\nTurnout estimating knowing how the people you ask respond is one thing and then estimating how many of those people are going to turn out and trying to speculate and use\nMath to uh to figure out which of those are going to turn out in in what percentages that's you know it they're just trying to factor in many many unknowns in come as close as they can\nLet me just remind everybody that it was like ... um she was how many points Fifteen points behind a and she ... and there was a fifty percent change\nWe're writing one was a major factor in that election or in that primary yeah go ahead which turned out I mean it was extraordinary\n... it was a special election in this although turned out he was ... years democratic surge model\nI think it's fair to to put into the Democratic surge if you look historically incoming presidents do very poorly in their first off term election Donald Trump is is going to I think perform a lot worse than Obama and\nClinton did in their first terms were and they do well you write write Obama lost I think sixty seats\nClinton I think lost fifty two so I think that Trump could certainly do worse than that well\nI eat out every night is out every now and he's got more of these ... of these things but I think he's hurting himself with a ... he's making making\nHim why you know the issue on the ballot not individual candidates which may hurt or help\nAnd and the other thing about this district is it's wet twice for Obama ... district what twice for Obama in once for Trump so it is truly a swing

which is Delgado according to this poll has a fifty four to thirty eight percent and manage a advantage among female voters\nSun and manage a advantage among female voters in the district we extrapolate that across the country and in other let's say swing districts what would that mean\nMhm well I think there's an expectation that more women will turn out perhaps maybe that's part of that it's revelation they were talking about or you were referencing and in describing it but we\nLand and we have an intervening variable as you political scientists say which is the the Mexican Government offering them a you know a\nA a silent Alan I'm schooling and job training right and it's like why are they doing that again\nBecause it's the right thing to do you know they're probably under pressure from the United states to do is they have enough trouble with the United states and they said this is a good way and they're also trying to keep them in ... in provinces that are less populated where they need in workers and they have the\nRight but I I think to to use the U.S military as part of a publicity stunt is really a outrageous that will work I'd probably do that and you know back to our conversation about these congressional races so to think that we have the military deployments\nCongressional races so to think that we have the military deployed in places in harm's way as we speak are and how much is that really coming up in these congressional races we had a panel last night a bar on the the conflict in Syria we have troops in Syria\nUm deployed definitely in harm's way\nWhat are they doing there how long will they be there or what is their role there or in Afghanistan would have been at war for Seventeen years I don't hear this coming up at all and yet on the front pages of the newspapers or it's this publicity stunt on the border I it really is outrageous\nAnd you gotta wonder what the soldiers who are going to be deployed to the southern border how they feel they signed up to serve the country and now they're going to go down and become a wall and on the Mexican border doesn't seem like great service [noise]\nWell and you wonder just how fought out it is um and ah because we had what eight hundred troops in my room at like eight hundred troops last week that he announced so uh what women ... are more profit ever to five thousand and is that just as an arbitrary is that that\nShows strength Joe it shows power it shows the president uses using his executive authority against what he calls invaders these ... men women and children pushing strollers elderly ... now United with their family that moved to the national emergency\nIt it it certainly is affecting the terms I heard on my way and on NPR Claire McCaskill's running out saying no one is tougher on the border of immune Donald Trump so while Trump hurts or in New York Trump help so I think and places like Missouri [noise] All right we have a couple of letters we'll go to those here\nWe go Allen having been a community college student not long ago I can tell you that many of my fellow students who are working and some were also parents so it's not surprising that they have

professional musician um and it was a very clear called from from music I felt that it's something how there'll be spiritual in that sense um and I think for young musicians the fact of\nOf being involved I mean it's just the most beautiful thing on on the universes write music and that just that they're getting the\n... my life to it is something that I I feel very fortunate to\nShow your um so when you say twelve years ago mhm I mean you were what Seventeen sixteen so there's always the teen years old yeah I mean you're very young now\n... yeah yeah well the thing is I mean my particular case I had to leave high school before um before finishing it so in in Colombia with my university is a very special place where where you could start\nA music career a university and college before finishing high school and finishing high school courses there at the same time so that is why could enter college a right to Fifteen and that decision\nHad to be made very seriously and er that's why I can remember very well when he was made\nSo you make that decision at at Fifteen ... and the musicians that you are working with now are are in that interact yeah man they're Fifteen sixteen Seventeen years old yeah so they're they're up against decisions just like the one you have to make\n... yeah that's that's one of the beauty beautiful responsibilities as to what I Do right now because um [noise]\nBecause nowadays uh the world has um some any offers a kids have so many things to do and are music is sometimes not a priority um [noise]\n... yeah so so inspiring them in everything of what we do at AT T always something that he's really really important for for us especially especially but not not only because of what they want to become you know because they they might be great\nUm professional musicians because we want them to be professional musicians who just because we wanted to be excellent and everything they do or excellent human beings and what we do with music is awe inspiring that explains\n[noise] do you are sort of the New York is always been known for for traveling for him or for I'm bringing the musicians to various places bringing the music to people I assume that wall continue\nYes of course I'm actually we are\nWell last last summer to our when or it gets so I went to Hungary and a tour\nUm our youth orchestra and they one day I conduct will stats are we are starting doing plans about our next international tour with that will take place next year we don't have any details yet but that's if seal those are police are still happening\nAnd and that's an important part of a rite of important part of the of the understanding the education of of of musical influences to to play another place was and to have that experience\nThat is that is that I was really important because music is well this is a very cliche quote by the music is that near universal language and where do you understand when you travel and\nYou understand when you travel and you see that other people with completely different cultures are are able to deal with music and music has the same impact that they have on you [noise] it's a very special and very important in your in your perception of the world and\nOf how ... how would the world works and how life works and how music is connecting everything together\nSo when you um I mean musicians are very um nomadic by nature or so is it nice to have a home you know to a place where you can hang your hat for a little while\nYeah I think it's a I think it depends on personality is I Do not know what to call home to be on his myself [laughter]\nI Am I think to call home um Albany\nUm since I moved here and uh and I love the warmth of the people in the community a buddy buddy that is something that the some new stations just like to be in one place and they they that's why they are they seemed to work at the time they just stay there forever but\nBut I've certainly they love traveling I thing I Love that quotes that say travel is the only thing you buy that makes you Richard ... in my case yeah\nAnd but but to ... and I mean you said cliche but it really is it in the sense that you you understand not only the other cultures you understand the universal language of music\nBut you also understand what it's like to I mean what a wonderful experience for for ah especially young people like yourself just a few years ago [noise] going from place to place an an understanding I'm understanding those different cultures and\nPutting that into a musical context as well\nYeah ... just a just just traveling without music it's already a enriching experience um and I think when you do week through music um you'll realize that those people that are so different um\nThan than you are having very meaningful experiences through music and those meaningful experience is through music out at the same that you are living and and and that makes you ... the the concept of way of music playing\nSo give us a sense we talked a little bit about the about what you'll be performing I'm On a Saturday Night first of all what are you make of the ...\n[noise] well I

will be performing and or have a little bit of different contexts uh before the the performance\nYeah so that's another that does that is wonderful to give a context\nYeah sometimes sometimes I well I Love a classical music um sometimes classical music some peace it could be a little bit more abstract than others\nAh music could be more ... than other art forms so uh I Believe that when you understand or rationally something you would be able to enjoy it even even more and\nSo uh I Believe that when you understand a rationally something you would be able to enjoy even even more and uh

his family he was born in Connecticut He was fairly wealthy his father was a ... a merchant out in the sea learn to Seattle to young age was very bright\nAnd he became an officer for the colonies and destroy the revolutionary war very successful very brave officer of the men loved him because he was right out there in the front lines fighting with them\nAnd his most notable achievement as many of our listeners know was in the battle of Saratoga which was fought in September and October of Seventeen Seventy seven\nAnd the British were rebuffed at the battle of Saratoga Arnold was not the main general that was ratio gates who was a very defensive minded kind of a general Arnold was just the opposite the two of them clashed Arnold led the battle that basically won the battle of Saratoga in the second skirmish in October of Seventy seven\nAnd he was wounded seriously in in the leg he suffered a very bad leg injury\nSaratoga in the second skirmish in October of Seventy seven and he was wounded seriously in the leg he suffered a very bad leg injury never fought for the Americans again but he remains on the American side for a few more years he was sent to West Point\nAnd what he did at this point he decided in his own mind that he would change and become a a British uh inside with the loyalist rather than the rebels and he tried to weaken West Point to a degree where the British could take it over him and he was discovered he was found out he barely escaped he could have been captured a West Point but he got away\nAnd the then fought for the British a little bit during the ... the revolutionary war after that but in that time in the revolutionary war even after the bell Saratoga there was no guarantee the British would when there were many loyalists in the country the\nBritish were still in in command of New York city and worked till the end of the war so it was not a foregone conclusion and Arnold had to fight with people like John Adams and the politicians of the day to get money to get supplies\nHe thought he should have been promoted when the ... or more money he didn't get any of that but the ... the people like Adams were\nMore concerned with the bigger picture and not just trying to placate or tried to make this one individual happy so it's a good a it's a good start for people that are interested in the revolutionary war and want to learn more about them and find out that yes he made mistakes but he was not necessarily the skinny one dimensional trader by any means\nThe name of the book is tragedy of Benedict Arnold by Joyce we Malcolm next up or the\nGame by colds is the name of the author and the game was between Harvard and Yale in Nineteen sixty eight or twenty nine twenty nine Thai that's not giving any way anything away 'cause the cover the Bush has has that they're right on the cover\nAnd this game was uh had national attention at the time unlike today in the late sixties the ivy league was a division one football power was not\nSomething that's secondary or no third rate kind of a football league that it might be today and what the game basically symbolize what sort of a combination of a very very difficult year in American history Nineteen sixty eight saw racial riots escalating the assassination of Martin Luther king\nWas certainly a huge negative factor there Robert F Kennedy was assassinated in the Vietnam War was escalating at the same time\nThere were campus demonstrations Harvard and Yale dodged the bullet to Columbia had to take at that time when the students basically took over the administration building there\nSo the ivy league was not immune from that sort of a violence and those sorts of huge passions that were going on\nIn the game itself had these two football teams yell was undefeated they were a heavy favorite Harvard was undefeated but they were long shots yell was basically a great offensive team at that time\nHarvard basically eked out victories in with a couple of months ago and the game with a minute to go you held yet lay at Yale led excuse me twenty nine to Thirteen and Harvard Square two touchdowns into two point conversions and recovered and onsite kicking the last forty two seconds which was kind of an incredible ending to the game\nAnd they considered a victory just getting a tie there was no overtime or anything like that but the team ... themselves were very notable there was some uh Vietnam veterans out of the teams are some people that basically were dead set against the Vietnam War and more than those that were supporting it certainly in the ivy league at that time\nAnd the game kind of was a catharsis for a lot of people in a lot of folks because there was just so much going on and so much tension it hadn't national attention in terms of the significance of the game again unlike the ivy league games today\nAnd they were very well known people involved Al Gore was going to Harvard George Bush was going to jail Tommy Lee Jones the actor was a lineman for Harvard\nAnd later on in his career after being of a movie star for so many years he said playing that game was one of the most important experiences he ever had in his life because so much what's happening in so much was evolving around that time and cold is a wonderful job of bringing that whole era to life with the with the highlight being this\nIt's light because so much what's happening in so much was evolving around that time and cold is a wonderful job of bringing that whole era to life with the mood to highlight being this one football game in November of Nineteen sixty eight\nGeorge how cold is the author of the game All right next to\nA stew reservoir tapes John McGregor is a well known British author English author and this is a very subtle books set in the
