union has our latest details on that story\nOr so there's a both are now there's two investigations actively going on in to this horrific crash Saturday in that town is go Harry where the twenty people were killed Eighteen people\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd uh the first we know about of course is the national Transportation Safety board which\nCould take a year could take two years they they take a long time they look into everything there there's a team on the ground in skull Harry now I'm a that are in a gathering evidence there they're going to\nTake a or B very deliberative in in what they report a lead up to this and the things that caused this terrible terrible tragedy over the weekend but the New York state police have opened a criminal investigation\nOr according according to state police into records reviewed by the time she union\nThe driver of the limousine or was not properly license to drive that specific kind of vehicle and it was a two thousand one Ford Excursion that had been modified originally was\nYou know off the off the dealer Florida would hold ten people so it was a pretty big vehicle and they are the head at modified or where it could hold as a as many as a Eighteen people\nAnd including the driver and [noise] state police major a rubber ... had a press conference yesterday and he described their probe as a criminal investigation\nOn their exam examining whether a negligence was a factor in the crash and it could result in criminal charges if somebody is found to have been negligent that to lead\nUp to this and contributed to this horrible thing [noise]\nAlso Monday state police investigators um [noise] uh we're out again at the scene along with the national Transportation Safety board people so they're continuing to gather it earlier yesterday the the big news was Governor Cuomo\nSaid the state is going to get a cease and desist order in court to keep the business that ran the ah that that provided the limousine which is called prestige limousine of Wilton which is near Saratoga Springs\nFrom operating until at least the NTSB has and and the state police complete the investigation\nOf the troopers have seized all three of the firm's remaining limousines and and Cuomo said they don't know the cause of the accident if it was a vehicle malfunctioning driver error or what um meanwhile the owner that company is is really a head Hussein or is in a is out of the country what is the guy's name [noise]\nShell had Hussein um his son a new mine Hussein or has been operating the company and he met with state police investigators yesterday and he was accompanied by as attorney\nWho said that they they won't comment but they spend a lot of time discussing it and they'll have other meetings and uh they're trying to get to the\nBottom of it he the attorney suggested that the limos a driver may have been unfamiliar with the roadway misjudged his ability to stop as he descended down route thirty towards the intersection of thirty a\nOf course there's been a lot of discussion about how dangerous this intersection is and how many accidents have happened there in the past and uh they had restricted the size of vehicles that could be on it no longer could tractor trailers take that route but\nI'm so like what about this other guy who owns it and his involvement with the FBI and ...\nAnd that's a very interesting side angle to this Hussein or had been an informant in a very controversial counter terrorism staying in Albany back in two thousand and four ah where he worked as an undercover agent for the FBI posed as an armed\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nRaft and he says he guys from central and write any of the pizza shop and Mohammed Hussein or the uh Hussein Mohammed Hussein was a Bangladeshi who a Bangladeshi who um was um owned a pizza shop in Albany\nAnd he in Iraq were arrested they were tried and they were sentenced to prison and ... was recently completed his term in ... he went back to his ... he was deported basically as soon as they get out of prison\nA and and all this I'm\nAn owner of the limousine company also helped the FBI in another case in Newburg a few years later where some others were convicted he he was basically a um an informant or for the FBI and he's done that or elsewhere for them also with Pittsburgh for his work family\nAnd that that was that did not result convictions but so he's been a and and he he got into some trouble himself when he was ill accused back around two thousand and two of\nHelping 'em people obtain fraudulently obtained driver's licenses immigrants and and he was facing charges deportation for that when he uh then was able to get that that go way by cooperating with the FBI so he was an interesting a person\nIs a question like whether or not um because he has cooperated with the FBI and others he gets a deal here whether this if I mean I've seen this before by the way we had a case in loopholes where somebody did something bad and um and the um\nThe FBI had apparently promised professors that he would go he would go he couldn't be fly but he was um so they do get involved sometimes a and I'm a little bit concerned that that might be the case here\nWell I mean that that would be if they found that he was culpable at or negligent in any way and I think what the focus right now is that this vehicle this specific vehicle was a inspected by the state department of transportation\nOn last march this past march and again in September or just a little more than a month ago yes I'm like\nIf you own vehicle right in the early ... yeah they'll the inspection sea and too many people were killed as a result of that somebody might want to take a look at the\nRight and and the issue is whether or not it was repaired the the the issue that they identified in the September fourth inspection was a hydraulic breaks\n... a lot of problems result because here you have a car off the shelf basically are off the showroom floor that has these breaks and then you you know you expand enormously and then you fill it full of people so it's a lot heavier than it was ever intended to be\nAnd whether the breaks that were on it originally were suitable to support the extra weight coming down the hill\nIs what what one of the things that they're looking at and and ah and whether it was repaired it's not knowing whether had been repaired after the September uh inspection ordinarily they get about two weeks Fifteen days to get it repaired and we're trying to find out if there was ever a follow up to make sure that it was repairs before was put back into ...\nLawmakers ended up to the individual who fail the test [noise] um and that's the only one issue here the other is that the driver apparently was not licensed did\nWhy he didn't have them I don't mean you don't want to you know what what happened here a lot of times they'll have certain um certifications on their licenses that allow you to drive a truck ally to drive a bus\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nTo drive this particular ... because a number of yeah and and and so it'd be\nWhether you know whether that's a factor in it that'll be something that both the state police in the NTSB will determine\nYou know and and and and the terrible terrible tragedy that on phones here as we learn more and more about the individuals most of whom were from the city of Amsterdam\nUm you know these were uh four sisters um ah they were newlyweds ... newlyweds were their young parents are best friends all getting together for a thirtieth birthday party\nAnd uh it just ended in this horrible\nTragedy and in our poll taco reduced to tears the as he gave his ...\nRight Paul taco lifelong Amsterdam a resident or are the congressmen from that district a new many of the family members and it was a poignant a service last night the bridge in Amsterdam\nThey keep talking about the generic congressional question\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNarrow it what the heck good as a generic congressional question actually when you have gerrymandering all over\nThe place so you know the the the whole question of what's happening in the polls and so this is something we actually studied you know so I'm not a pollster I'm a data guy we're we studied the election data after when we found was you know it's only twenty twelve the polls were\nI mean insanely accurate uh Nate Silver five thirty eight I mean it was up by one electoral vote or something in\nA twenty sixteen was all over the place twenty Eighteen we don't know in a there's a lot of factors\nAt work but uh you know you ... you know that a lot of what happens in the election as a primarily getting your people to vote right I'm a little bit of maybe get the other guy system the Trump election was all about getting people to stay home\nAnd that changed the balance tremendously\nJust came out with incredibly robust studied today specifically on the fact that Trump won because everybody stay home\nYeah the the data show that within three days man election I was actually on on on this radio station that you should support or with a little piece about that but but here's the right\nOne something like that happens that's going to be now become part of the body politics if you're if you're a Democrat the Republicans were going to try to make you not vote the Republican they're now going to be Democrats who are trying to make you not vote and if you're an independent\nOr both sides would like to stay home [laughter] and this one way you can break that and that's go out and vote for him why aren't they'll go what would\nWhat would the Democrats not want the independence devote All right I mean that's the only thing that I have a meaning ... the Democrat that flies in the face of any good field operation in any campaign and I do think this cycle the Democrats are working in the independent voters the ones who have the high democratic leaning scores\nUm to to get them out to ... I'm Sorry but the other part\nOf this that is so interesting is the huge gap\nBetween women and men voted in the United states is now up to eight and a historic\nTwenty five percent differential between the women who who who really can't stand Trump right and men who are by one percent for him well in the Trump would not be president had not white women overwhelmingly supported him is Republican women\nRight although although again what you see is a number of there you see a percentage that says how many people but that's of voters\nRight and what you realize is when you look at what the data shows the number of women who didn't vote for Hillary not voted for Trump leader stayed home left left the president bank\nWere voted for one of the third parties and actually the third parties don't look like they were what did it what it really looks like is people who didn't show up\nFor a long you know the term under ... some people who didn't vote for anybody for president and then one and voted for senators and congressmen and that was a staggering difference in the states that made the difference in Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin you just so very different numbers there then you saw\nA traditionally and be in the states that wasn't the way they expect it to the states where the polling\nWhen how it was expected were mostly states where the voting patterns look normal in the ... and the states where you sort of the polls go way up so I I think that ... this this this mid term\nI don't think we're going to know much about the polls pills until I was probably the next day will be the gym and why we got it wrong like this will be in the audience\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nCandidates the Democrat and Republican Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were among the least liked candidates by most of the American people or something some ... a result like\nThat oh yeah and well and and and you know you had the winter and get three million less votes and the loser and the and he found was in ... [laughter] right I mean if the ... I mean I mean just views that was the immigrants wasn't it was a vote they voted illegally and when you went to Germany\nAnd you took the the the football stadium there and filled it up for a big game that's roughly how many voters change this election got dragging higher country I mean just keep have you heard\nAny time I mean I think that happened with um walks in in sixty eight and Kennedy\nEnemy sixty one by one vote per election district in every election district in this country is what got Kennedy elected so it\nUnderscores nothing when you're thinking about not going out and voted saying it won't matter whether I vote or not\nIt does matter there's the ... you know our right to vote the franchise is one of the most important rights that we have it's the most basic thing for us to be able to participate in our democracy and make sure that the minority has a voice\nAnd it's really and it's there's not the tyranny of the majority and we have to we all just all have to get out and vote and it does make a difference and I understand how people can think of what's my vote what difference does it make but look what's happened\nRight well and and again you know the ... you were saying you know what we want to get those people out the problem is the other side wants to get them to stay no kidding so it's all about the what I really should have said for the independent\nWhat would what would elevate somebody makes yeah well I I don't think anyone is motivated to stay at home stayed home but what strategy would encourage somebody not to come out uh what what what do you think would be an example of how you would do they get real people on the sidelines the middle of the road ... the real negative\nAdvertising so it turns people off and particularly negative advertising that's part of it so so I was down in Virginia the week before the election God and so it's just a swing state and the Trump ads were Hillary's emails were found on the computer of a sex offender\nRight now now we know the video store economically true ugly true misses a few little ones about this story but that but now imagine you're not very educated middle of the road voter\nA crime and decide you know and and you you're you're tempted not to trust that these weren't adds to ... so so often negative ads are let me show you how bad the other person is so you'll come vote for me like this was let me say a ... percent so you won't vote one just look at the\nDelgado facile raised right here and the ads that were saying you've got the RMC making Delgado out to be a ... you know like you know the bad black man from New York City plus he's you know Nancy pauses packs and you've got that going on you got the ads about John vote in the wrong way on health care right which\nShowed that they're making that same it then you have married Francis his wife\nCome and do the front porch ad of John was with me when I had cancer diagnosis he voted the right way blah blah

you know you're trying to meld the different people's visions into one thing so there's a constant editing and you know oh what you did kind of changes what I wanted to do so now I'm going to change the scene but then that changes the song and then there's there are all these ripple effects which is partly why it takes so long\nTo make a musical um because it it just you know it requires that kind of\nSustained concentration and and collaboration\nThere was one big difference though that as well in that there was no musical and so you guys created it in this case there was a musical about that you know so you had to like match that\nYeah and this is Stephen and I think that that makes it easier in some ways and done a lot harder it is it was easier in some ways definitely\nAnd then the the ... it's a tremendous amount of pressure like we said it's more of a movement than just a [laughter] not that I live just to play but you know what I mean\nThere's just no narrative limitations you know in the in the musical you get to hear from 'em you know Evans mom from her own mouth what she's feeling\nAbout raising a kid and and the same thing from um counters parents the Murphy's in the book because you're hearing it mainly from Evans perspective you have to find new ways to kind of get the feeling of you know these other major characters in the in the musical\nAs he built the musical there's of course as there always is some things get cut things change up until the show is frozen before it opens and even between Iran say indeed see or read arena before it\nComes to Broadway it it changes and you granted access to some of that material for reading of the novel tell me about\nHow how that decided how that kinda stuff come back for this project\nIs Justin and well you know it's really just that um the necessary economy of of a stage show is just that you know ... you have to be incredibly intentional with what is taking up that real estate and every line counts every\nEvery bit of dialogue counts every line of a song counts even though you want to have room to explore emotionally in a musical you still have to sort of have that airtight feeling that the stories always pushing forward we can't sit and\nSort of ruminate and contemplate um the way that you can I'm In a novel and such an appealing way but at least somewhat the book does some of its new and it's still jibes with what's in the show but uh there's a good amount of that that is um I think really interesting backstory\nUm for so many of the things that you might see in musical or sort of a accepted on stage\nBut in a book we eat are found it was interesting or actually necessary to explain them and that was great because\nSo much of it we had thought about it we had talked about as a group you know so much of what makes it onto the stage we had\nConcocted these elaborate back stories and what ... family had what had happened with Evans family and what was Connors story all these things and are that are part of the story in the world of Evan Hansen they just couldn't make it on stage but it was all sitting there and and\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nVal I'm and some of that was used and then the beautiful thing was about creating a new ... story that hadn't been in our minds but had in a way because it was so right for the characters and so in line with how we viewed them and get something we had never thought of and that was the most bizarre and wonderful experience I think was\nYou know hearing some back story that we had never thought of that have Alex planes in the book and we're like yes that that's that is what happened that that must have been what happened because that's the character that we know and that's what would have happened um it was an it's an eerie but very singular experience\nBefore the existence of the novel do the actors who are playing these characters on Broadway and now on tour no the information that should they now read this to learn about themselves\nThat's a really interesting question this has been um\nYou know I think that if the actress job to provide a lot of the back story for whatever's going to help their performance but hopefully what we have done is we've just enriched and supported what already exist on stage and I think\nWe've given each character a deeper sense of humanity a deeper sense of of\nSelf because you know as Justin said we have to be very economical about what we're allowed to do on stage so you know we get we get more room to play we get to really really investing back story and I think you know I I I I think the actors I think would be fascinated to read it\nBut I guess it's up to them really you know whatever help their performance but hopefully everything is really consistent with in the world was one thing that was very important to us was we wanted to\nHave the experience that you wouldn't really be able to separate the novel from the musical you might say you know the two years from now oh that musical that's based on the book or that book that's based on the musical and we hope that they really exist in the same world and they both deep in the other experience\nThe book is available severe going out on

and we can't wait to get to meet so many of the people that are already familiar with these characters and get to share the novel um with them\nBut Steven you're staying in the city 'cause you have a

house seems very familiar to LA to even though she doesn't think she's ever been there and and she's just intrigued and then the story delve back through the years all the way back to Eighteen sixty two when a group of young artists led by the passionate and talented Edward Radcliffe descend on birch would manner on the banks of the towns\nTheir plan to spend a secluded summer months in a haze of inspiration and creativity but by the time there's days over one woman has been shot dead well another has disappeared a priceless heirloom is missing and Edward Ratcliffe life is in ruins so that's how the clock makers daughter starts off\nYou recommend I highly recommend scary it's scary but it's a wonderful historical fiction the one complains about the book that I've heard is that there's so many narratives and they're and they're flipping back and forth in time if you have to have like a cheat sheet I Love that kind of\nReally [noise] who's who's a lot of work you know that's OK recounting what were your reviewers from gotten killed books and what's next on the list\nI don't want to take all the time so I'm going to turn it over to ... it might have ... omission okay book\nCase today I'd like to introduce a couple of picture books and a newly released young adult book and the first picture book is called a house that once was by Julie ... illustrated by lane Smith\nDeep in the woods is a house just the hell is that once was but now isn't a whole\nAnd with that opening line we joined the boy and the girl as they head who dreamy pastel like color

who lived in this house\nWho ate beans for dinner [laughter] in the mirror who left without packing\nThere is an unspoken infant invitation to wonder what the children where that person might be at the time\nWe live with ambiguity as no answers are given to these questions house it once was as a gentle adventure that many of us may have wished we had had as children or maybe even as adults and it's for ages four to seven [noise]\nMy second choice is a home in the barn by Margaret whites brown illustrated by ... caught medalist uh Jerry pick Pinckney\nAnd this is a great book for a holiday present for your young preschooler as ms brown describes the animal seeking the shelter if the big red barn at the cold winter approaches\nMr Pinckney illustrates the increasing activity as the barn begins to still with the mice the cattle\nThe chicken the cats um the horses the barn swallow as that goes to the pigs you name it they all end up in the foreign\nAnd despite their PR pen city towards chaos Mr Pinckney is able to picture a safe community as and Edward Hicks peaceable kingdom\nWhile we can almost hear the winter wind howling outside [noise]\nThe only thing that doesn't work for me and the book is that the writing switches back and forth between rhyming verse and free form and so you have to kind of let that slide\nStylistic Georgian it is it is but you know it's\nAn old old no Margaret was brown is you know older and as they just put this I'm into print with um with Jerry's pictures so yeah it's a great picture book\nStyle and I think needs illustrations carry the store forward I think ... might still recommend them\nAnd the last book I Want to share is the novel bridge of clay by Marcus ... sack who also wrote the book thief\nWhich is one of my favorite books to sack writes young adults are novels that easily appeal to adults and this book it's just released today so I've just begun to read it and I was pulled into the story\nThe first chapter Matthew one of five brothers heads to a small town the day after his wedding\nWith the mission to dig up an old typewriter in the backyard of an old farmhouse and so he writes in town they ask for directions and uh he's recognized immediately though\nJust because of his family relations and it's given the directions shows up at the house they willingly let them go into the back yard to dig up\nThe uh to find this a typewriter and in the process um [noise] he's been warned that he if he doesn't ... he's going to find a dog skeleton and a snake second skeleton [noise]\nSo he proceeds to drink he finds the dog skeletons he finds this\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot

... brothers are living together with their imaginary menagerie of pets in a perfect chaos of the house and anyway I Want to find out what the typewriter it's all about I Can't wait\nTo have you have to find a way down there this morning and I like I said I Want to get my hands on that one ... so\nCome they get up and read it and I I Will I'll find out together what happens\nNow I Know there's an

one to do and you're wondering I have one in thirty second\nCall [noise] oh yeah he wanted to talk about Africa so Arizona um I had a chance to go to Africa about a year and a half ago and worked in a with some schools in the slums of Nairobi I came back to the U.S and Cannae a offered to um\nHave people buy books at discounted send to Africa and\nWe raised over three thousand dollars or more cautious looks at from the Cambridge community and those books arrived just this past week ... in Nairobi and we are we're going to have an event somewhere along the line just trying to highlight that\nSecond part of your book is about I Believe as you call in addition to the nightmare than his money there is a horrible thing called banking\nOr as you quickly so us fractional reserve banking so how do we get the banking and what most people realize or more importantly I think as you point out so rightfully in the book what most of us don't realize about banking\nWhich is that that the that there's no money in the bank [laughter]\nI mean in our heart of hearts we know better intellectually but in our heart of hearts we think of banks as Scrooge Mick ducks money vault\nEnded the bankers ah ah when they get in at ten in the morning what they do is they take their clothes off and they die of around and the piles of nickels and dimes yeah but there actually is no money in a bank um do you give them money you give money to the bank and with the bank goes with that money is admittedly gives\nIt to other people or the idea being that they pay you a little bit of rent for your money and they charge other people when the houses of the mortgage and so on money uh to uh they charge those people rent or to to to use that same money\nUh and all this would be fine now that would that would be a right out of a it's a beautiful life\nAre you under you know you put your money and then we we put that money to work so that people can buy houses and start businesses and so on and it would be the simple concept of capitalism he accepted it turns out that um [noise] uh the the bankers and actually hold either your money\nOr the debts that they don't actually hold the loans they sell the loans\nWhat they do is terrified of absolutely no idea [noise] and to start a bank doesn't take a bunch of money because you actually borrowed you have to maintain certain reserves in order to have a bank in case there was a run on the back but you can borrow those reserves\nAnd it's all a utterly mysterious transactional void that the more you look into it the bigger headache you get a and of course of this\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nSystem is a a I mean let us come to the more to the point which is our money itself [noise]\nOur money is doesn't exist or money is a mansion or a um the government says that the dollar is worth a dollar and then print says many dollars as it sees fit\nAnd on it goes is crypto currency the answer well no I mean it seems to be the\nProduct of the evil math club with weaponized slide rules from your high school um\n[laughter]\nOnce you start thinking about the medium of exchange uh and and the transactions that go on a basically in in their ... it's no wonder that people are sort of driven crazy by economics which is fun for me\nA yes absolutely so two points one is one of my favorite lines in the book is the use in other words the money that you have deposited in a bank is guaranteed by money that you've loaned the bank plus money that you've deposited in the bag which the bank owes you back plus a parking lots of\n[laughter]\nSo what you what what should our relationship me with a machine we trust our bank then\nYes I mean the whole thing sort of operates on trust and if the if the trust what what happens when the trust evaporates is Venezuelan [laughter] so we don't want to wish that on ourselves so we have to\nGo along with this ... this kind of a fantasy but we also have to kinda keep our eyes open ... people were unprepared for the terrible inflationary periods say during the during the Nineteen seventies\nUm ah got harmed a lot and of course there's some people out there are people on I'm old people people on fixed incomes um people with very narrow economic means um who can't be preparing the rest of us have to be you know a little prepare but that doesn't necessarily mean\nBurying Krueger rounds in the yard or\nBut it is it is important\nTo understand what what a what a what a delicate fabric the hum of the economy is and it's probably important to to um uh you know keep a small stock of groceries and a marketable skill\n[laughter] I don't have one anymore I'm a print journalist so I'd lack a marketable [laughter] you know for years\nI was a writer for that you know for for decades does writer\nNow I'm a content provider and of course the message of the Internet is the content is free\nWell a PG ... new book is none of my business but then you went into the very lucrative profession of radio so good\nFor exactly [laughter] and then that fortunate\nI make from my like twice a year early appearance on wait wait don't tell me you know fortunately that's able to send their kids to college and pay the mortgage on a\nVery nice as so when you're talking about crypto currency\nAs you explain that though in the book it it's all sort of monopoly money and and it it's I understand your point about crypto currency and bitcoin and and the like although as you describe it it's really more no more ludicrous then what you just described is happening in our will know that\nThat that's the amazing thing is is silly and insane as as as crypto currency is it is a sort of\nMinor private sector reflection of what central banking is uh\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOnly the money that we use but to mind that the Chinese use the the the Europeans uses the Brits use all the money in the world is made up an imaginary money um there are a lot of institutions though in a sort of a ... a and a clear market places\nUm that that keep our ordinary money from from acting as insane as it fundamentally is some as much money\nI mean the variety of different kinds of money there's there there's commodity money which is actually something valuable the uh uh in North Africa salt was used as money's hence the term salary or the ancient Aztec she used cocoa beans is money\nUh we're more familiar with gold and silver medieval Norwegians used a butter and cod was their ... their ATMs were mass [noise]\nUm so you have this commodity money is money that's actually a valuable in itself the nurse for do share a money which is a piece of paper that promises you that commodity that is what American money was when we were still on the gold standard\nAnd then there is something called the money which is there because it's there because it's there because it's there and it's it's it's issue by the government\nOn the basis of what I think of as the bad parent theory or that the that the government uh um issues us our money much the way we we bad parents issue orders to our children ah we ... and in the end when they challenges we says because we said so\nAnd so the dollar is there and the euro in a room and be in the pound or all there because the government said so\nFortunately there is a market in these currencies pounds starts to rapidly lose its value you can trade pounds for heroes of the euro starts to go to hack or you can trade them for dollars are for ... um\nUnless you're in a totalitarian system like Venezuela where you can't get rid of your currency it's basically illegal to get rid of your currency\nOr if you're in trickster land with a crypto currency um which which seems in theory like they're only going to be so many units of it it's it's it's it's all the transactions are transparent\nIt's all available out there on the block chain you can also see it and trust it [laughter] [laughter] yeah\nYou can trust that if you if you happen to have a PHD in mathematics which I'm this old English major does not [laughter]\nWhat are the things that is not new about this current presidency there are a lot of things that are new you may have noticed but there\nIs there's a novelty factor in the play one\nOf the things that is not new ... is that we hear a lot about when it comes to our economy about China's impact on our economy and of course we've heard a lot about that for a very long time you and a couple of friends decided that you were going to a barn stormed China and\nLearn about this place and its impact ultimately on our economy you have a chapter in the book called five things I Know about China what did you learn\nWell I'm a little out of date with my kind of expertise and then of course I don't think anybody else including the Chinese have any kind of expertise at some\nPlace but you know a couple\nOf things that that that were immediately evident and try and it was probably the most important thing to keep in mind as this is still a very poor country I mean you go to Lynn glittering coastal cities and uh and and you think
