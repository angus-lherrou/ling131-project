syndrome and so there you go [noise]\nAh one eight hundred three two three Ninety six to WAMC dot O. R. G. All right let's get to the topic at hand or which really is a fun drive but will ah will go to other topics which include what is happening in the world so I was going to start with the Trump tax scheme story because it's fascinating\nAnd the times it's amazing reported on it and uh that the president and his family engaged in these elaborate tax schemes which may give us a some inkling as to why his taxes have been so problematic over the years\nUm but I'm going to hold on one for a second and go for the low hanging fruit which is the fact that the president\nMocked uh mocked\nOr the accuser in the cabinet or a hearings a doctor ... Ford who testified just\nA week ago tomorrow that uh she was sexually assaulted by his uh Trump's um pick for the Supreme Court and so he went to a a rally as as you want to do\nAnd this was in South haven Mississippi and he mocked the account of the woman who accused Brett Kavanaugh and told the crowd that the me too movement was unfairly hurting men\nI don't know I don't know upstairs downstairs where was that I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember Trump set afford as he impersonated her on stage I don't remember he said repeatedly apparently mocking her testimony\nHaving seen it I don't know that it was like apparently I think it was fairly obvious that he was walking testimony but\nSo so Joe what's to change the chain and seems to me is now thinks he can get them through he can get Kevin on through and looking at these senators are there in memory you can get Susan Collins it's very simple Susan Collins if she goes\nAgainst Kavanaugh if she votes know she'll get into a primary and she'll lose\nBecause if you take a look at the Republican numbers behind Trump\nAnd behind I'm Kevin all or they are solid there's solid and those same people will hold it against them and the people in this uh Mississippi a little places thing yesterday role yelling we want Kevin no we want capital so if this is Susan Collins moment\nFor history she could say okay I'll be the profile in courage you know I shouldn't tell this story\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nWas to dissenting vote was the carrying vote in the abortion or having the the allowance to have an abortion in New York state I was here that's how old I Am the guy said I Know I Will lose\nIf I Do this but I'm going to do it because I have to do it and you know what is the history of the New York state legislature goes this guy will always be remembered unlike all of his colleagues who will never be remembered this way\nSo let me ask you this question on which is with that in mind with that very very good point in mind if you're Susan Collins dozens this make it more difficult decision when the woman who has come forward to tell about the most horrifying thing that she is experienced in her life\nAnd she is being mocked by the leader of the free\nWorld and by the way I'm a Collins is set that already Collins is I Believe this morning Collins and that was terrible along with flake who said it was terrible but\nWhether now flake wants to run for president what's his profile in courage or will he get the nomination from the very Republicans who are so intent on supporting a Trump and and Kevin off or in the end is it'll BS you know that's the question\nWhat Susan college has a long history of skin writing these ways and allowing people to do back flips trying to figure out what she's going to do um and in the end usually just go on with the party line um I I also think that uh this a response\nBy our a disturbing president uh about a duck\nThe Ford is also related to the New York times story about his tax evasion I think he has a pattern of always reacting in a very um the fostering way and I say something outrageous right and and you know in many ways we are doing this morning we're talking about that story\nAnd that of his ... and then did we did start with the taxes we didn't we didn't and all I can say is on my seven forty five commentary I made the point you to this is in public the material I don't know what it yeah I remember it will go to that as I\nSaid I I Would I Want to START I want to start on the uh with the low hanging fruit just because I think we can get the ... those went out of the way quick\nBut it's it is it's still the surface all the ... I'm Sorry again [laughter] [laughter] well it's going to say that it ... this is someone who last\nWeek also called the same woman he mocked credible um this is also a a case of um observing\nWhat he does best which is a rallying or a certain base um if you look at the the numbers of pulling in that area you know I think\nThat's just supporting supporting what yeah it's um [noise]\nAnd I don't think I think the danger and making the comments though is is um what constituents in other places will hold 'em the response by that the senators who can make a change a accountable\nEven when Lindsey Graham gave his now famous greed is that day when they kicked out of their hand picked prosecutor at all of a sudden you know there he was and she was gone um\n... member when he turned around to the other people on the panel they sort of pointed at them and said you just better vote for this guy ...\nSomeone who who Trump also said and remarks just within the past couple of days that I don't know him\nI just met him in the other day um so\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHim as credible when you also say that I don't know him\nYou know but that's that's true but what's been puzzling me and I don't know about you other panelists\nUm it was been puzzling me is that\nIf you listen to Trump real carefully over the Kavanaugh saying he was sort of sending out signals that maybe it would work out um and I don't fully understand what that was but it's about the Senate and I'll be looking at this and I'll be looking at the FBI report and by the way\nI'm Sorry I don't want to join Trump in his FBI bashing but I'm very concerned about this we have heard from Ford Mrs Ford Dr Ford and now I'm Yvette they haven't even interviewed her they haven't gone jar so so this may be a set up to\nMuch mix I'm Sorry go oh well I just think the the one thing to watch dog is the relationship and the conversation going on between the White House and the FBI and that's not the case\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nUsable or um you can go here you can move their exactly shows is when you say you know what names what potential witness information can be released and what can't Trump keeps\nSaying again and again I'm not making these decisions than it is but he doesn't mean the Senate he means is the one extra vote\nThe Senate Republicans have that's what he's saying and and he's got to be careful with that defense out because we were just talking about Susan Collins and she's the one who's saying the FBI should\nBe talking to that is the third I'm a ... a in this case and and so\nYou can't just fall back on your usual expectation and Jen I don't know if we're ever going to get told what the FBI report said\nBecause it's quite clear they're going to give it to the president and to the Senate um and that the Senate\nWill make the and that's where I think the Senate will come in to to play on that because I think the Senate's defense has has been we heard that during the the trials last week that um you know the the FBI doesn't make convictions the the FBI just gets information right\nLet's be honest we don't we know that these Republican senators are supposedly on the ... did they really do more evidence to make the decisions\nJust based on what we know already just based on the way he conducted himself during the hearing is more than enough evidence to suggest that this individual is not the type of person that should be on the court regardless of his party regards to police regardless of his drinking\nHis disposition his personality his absolute a disdain for government obviously that he showed during the day is a is disqualifying with any\nPartisan fiercely party and it's the Democrats who were after me it's Hillary Clinton who's after\nThe president's the president of the care about that in the Senate and other Republican Senate doesn't care about\nThe only reason they did I think we would have been a greater clamor for not just an FBI investigation but a third party investigation\nWell I went I went to a court school the acquisition and maintenance of political power oh\nAnd that's what we'll let it go slow we're just lucky yeah yeah ... well it was ... it was otherwise known a shark talk five\n[laughter] right\nBut but I always loved that name I remember I don't remember who suggested it but it was a great name how about your students as some other news for that course we had talked trial I don't know five [laughter] [noise]\nSo we need Nineteen thousand dollars will buy we need is we need it twenty five Nineteen now see how this works this one well um but but we only go ahead no it's not no I Know because my heart my heart ... or so WAMC dot org one eight hundred three two three nine to six to\nThe other thing that I Can't I don't I don't know a lot of this has been talked about it maybe it's just because I'm making it up but it isn't it weird\nTo have all this pressure if you will be put on the FBI the same FBI that this president for the last year and a half has done nothing but excoriated and say how awful they are appointed\nMade yesterday Joe and I couldn't agree with you more or and you worry that people like sessions and Rosenstein both Republicans say yeah you know this is a bone we can photos of the president or so that because they're supposed to be overseeing all of this and you know I've never I've never been in love with\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery

really help us a warning on details that make sense and our stories together um but it you know where we start\nDuring like my grandparents time we put our lives into social and political context that predate us quite a bit so it's a lot to cover in an hour and Fifteen minutes\nWould you get do you think your story them is surrounded by for their stories so for the for the protests have been for the for the audience what do you think they get out of the the ... of stories that are they're coming from a stage\nI think the beauty of it is that um some parts of our story will resonate with some parts of our audience and so\nAs good art should be it resonates differently with every single person who observed that or comes away from 'em takes away from the play what they most identify ways but I really hope that people can take away that um the muscle experience in America\nIt does not look one way it does not feel one way um and we are all really complex very diverse people\nSo without giving too much away what reducing makes your story unique\nOh I don't know why I'm In this play [laughter]\nMy story is you know in my eyes so ordinary but at my colleagues are incredible um I've traveled a lot growing up I have a pretty strong drive\nTo work in social justice and that's relatively uncommon I'm definitely in my family but even in sort of a people of the same background is me um and I think that having that drive at a very young age probably is unique 'em to not that many people\nAre and I'm really proud and I'm really proud to be able to share in the form\nAnd I'm always the same question to you of what you think the audience takes away of of hearing these five stores and who\nI think that like my side you know these are human stories and whether or not you come from the same cultural or religious background you're hearing stories of the challenges of growing up of struggles with parents of questions of learning who you are you want to be in the world and I feel like the audience relate to those stories first\nAnd then whether or not they have experience or whether they're Muslim themself or whether they're coming from a place where they made me think they've never met someone who's Muslim they're seeing the human story first and then from that hopefully people are rippling out to saying oh okay\nThis is a Muslim experience that I'm hearing about on the news maybe isn't the everyday person sitting next to me on the train tonight\nAnd I think that I'm hearing people tell their own stories in their own words regardless of what your politics maybe is what people connect to is just hearing that first hand experience and knowing that that person could be your neighbor or someone that you're interacting with at the store\nRoughly how many stories you have a total for the company\n[noise] so uh this project we've we've done\nOver a hundred shows and you know we've interviewed thousands of people um each show usually there's five to seven people in the show and so depending on the theme of the show with on projects around I'm living with a disability of being a survivor of sexual violence of the refugee or immigrant experience in the United states\nSo I Would say thousands of stories I'm In this kind of\nA body of work over over a generation\nAnd the generation is important ... but as a generation a new look at it we're thinking about

olds and so they had all been born at or around the year two thousand and so you know this generation of Eighteen year olds is you know they're coming of age they're becoming adults at the ... century becomes adult as it were\nSo I think that I'm looking at their experiences and becoming politically engaged in political politically active\nIt's something that our group and beyond sacred to talk about as they are they're sort of political awakening send their sense of self in the world\nI'm being children are teenagers when nine eleven happened where they weren't fully formed yet as adults versus or their parents or grandparents who had um had kind of come into their own being and had the world's changed around them\nI mean as you said ... I mean you you are certainly more socially politically active than almost anyone else in your family but I Would assume that's the reason why ... what you were living through all the time\nYeah it certainly it certainly helped um I\nI I had moved from the middle east about a year before nine eleven happened so I think for me um this the difference in how I was treated was really salient the difference of how Muslims are portrayed in the media was really a parent because I was already getting you still living in the U.S at the minority [noise] um and so\nFor me it's certainly unsettled something that ah you know people were being painted with such broad strokes and um you know muffins this religion that I had left for all of my life was being portrayed in the way\nI'm In less than one percent according to some estimates of the country as much land so the vast majority of Americans don't know Muslims so this was a really great a platform to be able to actually speak to people and give unique personalized experiences\nAnd if I could add to that one thing I think about the sort of idea of political engagement for the folks in the show and for the young people is that it's not just about\nBeing in response to their Muslim identity but these are also people who are first generation immigrants who are people of color who are growing up in socio economically disadvantaged communities and so their their activism and our desire to see change in the world comes from many other sources beyond just their Muslim identity as well\nOne what sorts of you know and now a hospital climate right absolutely sure Paul supports us into perspective of what's going to be the ...\nWhich will be doing you know we have to a Muslim women who are really dynamic and spectacular coming on

comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThis this morning along with actors Tara Franklin and James Mary and it is a pleasure to welcome history oh to the roundtable this morning how are you fine how are you Joe I'm finding out what a wonderful treat that you all here to be here thank you well thank you All right\nWell Eric you're up first tell us about naked and how you came to this particular play of wanting to put it on the stage at the unicorn\nWell as usual I relied upon Cape McGuire the artistic director who selected the play offs have life is\nAlso my life [laughter]\n... so when I asked she hands me a plane and says do you want to do this I the the answer the question comes with the question when you say but it but the question is do you want to do that they all comes down for a decision that you have to and and I did\nWant to do it very much ah I Love hearing delo and this play obviously well if you if you know the play and when you come see you will understand that his landed\nA timing wise at the absolute perfect time or what we're experiencing with the judge Kavanaugh and all of that uh is very much reflected in the themes and the discussions that you hear in the play\n[noise] uh so that seems like a mom\nI'm actually about the great part of the great fun [laughter] I Know if you add it all up yet [laughter] I buy\nAnd its elemental part I think what we understand is that first of all it was written a at the beginning of the previous century Nineteen twenty six it's play about Nineteen twenty two in Italy so there is is some distance on the subject and I'm certainly\nAh the amazing part about the play is how relevant it is to today and how right on Mr parents ... and his observations but he does a take an interesting form which is the mellow drama something a lot of people aren't familiar with and he uses that for them\nTo tell his story so there's a lot of entertainment value to what he does here there's a mystery involved a it's play that takes a lot of wild turn some comedic uh so there's a great mix in the process and then he does have a tendency to\nAh as he is wanting to do reverse reality on you and begin to show you the other side of a situation you may have looked at one way and then you begin to look at it from another angle\nSo before I turn the conversation to the to find actors in the studio give me a sense of what the challenges are of directing social work\nWell such work is written in Italian first of all and uh so you're dealing with the tax that's not in English a literal translation says these places exist but one of the reasons they're so rarely produce ... ... not produced so frequently is that the the literal translations are hardly theatrical this is an adaptation by Nicholas right\nAnd so he really helps me with my hardest chore which is to bring the in the English idiom to bear on attacks that is essentially a Taliban and heart so uh that challenge a I think is something that we've met and come to understand and not and that was a hurdle we had\nTo cross and then a real quick before we go to the actors just tell us a little bit about the the the Castro Raul in the sense of the characters that they play and and how these to fit in\nThe the play is a mystery to centers around to a woman are silly a a play by Tara Franklin and um how she\nAh has been manipulated by the men in her life which there are three particular an author whose home she sought out as refuge a young lieutenant who she had a briefly quoted in\nA a foreign country where she also had an affair with uh the ambassador there ah and she has now come to Rome or from this place smart enough to ah to this
