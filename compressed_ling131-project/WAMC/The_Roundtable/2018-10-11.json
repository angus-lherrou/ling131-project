you do I wasn't aware of the [laughter] the riders to these contracts [laughter] it's going to be a good thing [laughter] I don't know what other amazing\nInnovation I Want to mention if I can do um I happen to get I I bought a copy effect similar copy of the manuscript of the Brahms violin concerto you know which is possibly the greatest of all violin concerto and what's so interesting is that it's got all the problems markings from the time he conducted the premier with his friend from you wrote it if you're lucky him\nAs of right now I I don't think the story has anything to do with karaoke no doesn't know what\nThe ROMs a performance you're going to hear that because I have ROMs markings as the conductor of the premier what you're actually going to hear is not me conducting you're going to hear Brahms himself conducting his own violin concerto\nIsn't that putting more pressure on you then you need\nNo less pressure because it's just prompt conducting threw me seeking okay All right but I Will handling Brahms but it's so cool that I found this facsimile and actually had his own markings from when he conducted it\nSo he he highlights all these things quickly the dynamics allowed in the sauce as I said to my wife this obviously suggested Brahms really cared a lot about dynamics and she said maybe he was just had um he just near sighted and he needed to be able\nTo [laughter] that it takes some of the war was near sighted there it's it's a it's been documented\nIn this was a a dumb question maybe I don't know but ... wouldn't wouldn't you have access to other conductors of notes that you could uh then you could do similar to what you're doing the Bronx\n[noise] oh I I have access via YouTube to every record of performance in history a so early\nOne no but I got a little while I'm seeing a facsimile of of of the notes and so forth earlier is that rare\nAnd those are very hard to find I mean you can find facsimile copies of manuscripts a certain rate great works but usually they don't have\nConducting markings ... in them because they're going after usually didn't conduct the premier or did mark them up so you have usually just what he or she wrote but here you have what he wrote an overlay that a big black ink or pencil or whatever was you have his indications from when he actually conducted so I have this incredible insight into what Brahms thought were the priorities when he conducted\nAnd that's what you'll be looking at on Saturday Night that's I won't be conducting from it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now

because I have been able to pay homage to her\n[noise] so when you are out there and I'm a I'm sure you heard this because this is what people were talking about during intermission when I went to go see it which is a well God\n... wouldn't it be great to have her back ... I mean wouldn't it be great to have her on the scene right now\nAnd and then the conversation sort of turn slightly too\nWell there are a lot of people like her right now who are doing incredible work and that part of it is very inspiring isn't as\nYeah incredibly inspiring to both Jane and I into the whole team when we look around and we see\n'em all of the women that are running and you know we kept coming into rehearsal and being like did you see this person did you see that person that person did such a great debate and\nUm it is really inspiring to see that and you know we're in one of the interviews that we watched in our research somebody was talking to Ann Richards and asking how she was feeling about you know women in politics and she said well don't get me wrong I Am\nCompletely outraged at the lack of equity but I have to remember that a hundred years ago my grandmother couldn't even vote and I became the governor of Texas [noise]\nUm so you know I think if we look at deep time um and we look at who's out there right now running up and running against\nCandidates I'm On an all parties and sort of the platforms that they're coming we were inspired by brand new Congress you know as an organization that's that's really raising money to put people in office without big money\nUh and that so yes yes is the short answer to your question there is a lot of inspiring people out there that seem to be that will hopefully be making a change for deep time\nYou know ... you and I talked about this uh uh the night and and I thought it was it was interesting because I I'd seen the show on\nBroadway with Holland and one of the things that I forgot about it or was how much she included\nHer kids and that sort of every every kid every person close to her just a moment in the show of we we not only learn about her we learn about her relationship with her kids and about our kids\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu full\nPerson not just the political animal\nYeah I think the thing was that she was first a mom she was a wife than a mom and then she went into politics and she used all those skills\nAh in her work and she cleaned up the treasury she uh she and her team earned more non tax dollars and all the treasures and the history of Texas combined you know they were keeping checks and bags in the in a closet till they filled up are you kidding me\nAnd to and she just brought that uh\nThat know how there's a wonderful line in the play that says you know women have the talent for bringing a consensus maybe it's all those hours around the dinner table making sure that everybody gets their\nSay and also get to a piece of the pie too now I you know that may be antiquated today I don't know but I Know that I myself as a mother and a wife had to get all those things\nGoing on and they get in a car and go off and do a show you know in New York\nAnd so I think it is still going on you know but uh you know it's not just being being a mother a prepares you for politics but I think there is this feeling that that women tend to create\nA conversation and consensus and I love that about her and\nIt you are watching her juggle many plates but it did cost her at the end of her life she said you know now I Know and we're learning this much earlier age now I Know where to turn my attention where it actually can do some good and learn how to say no and that's the other thing that I think she learned later in her life\nThat we're learning as women now as well um I Can't speak for men but I Know that I have learned how to say no that's not going to work from ... where I Want to put my energy and my attention as she was very good at doing that she loved her kids at her grand babies to very much\nThe uh we just have less than a minute but of course one thing I just wanted to point out too is is that they're at the end of the show there is this there's this moment where you\nYou you really have the opportunity to talk about the future and where we are and and and that I think\nYeah that is I think our caller relevant and yeah sure it's our call to action and I'm a U.S citizen I'm originally from Canada and now I have dual citizenship and I just\nPut in my absentee

then found that subjects that you follow throughout the future\nI have this very specific memory of I'm getting ready for work in the fall of twenty fourteen and it was around the time when there were several high profile cases of women in the gaming industry who were being targeted on line by these coordinated online mobs\nI produced and wrote a film called bully which had come out a few years earlier and it was kinda that phase of being like okay what's the next project going to be and hearing these stories and\nHearing that there seemed to be really no recourse that law enforcement was not taking these cases seriously that\nThe site operators seemed to not be providing adequate protections I felt that there was an opportunity here to tell the stories of these women in a way that could potentially\nReally shift the needle on this issue\nAnd highly what was happening for so many women so I remember having a moment of ... I think this is a next phone I think this is it [noise]\nSo once they realize that this was the film that I felt like I really wanted and needed to make [noise]\nThere was a long road to figuring out exactly who was going to be in it and the first thing that I did was I started calling attorneys because I figured they would be the people who would know who have cases who's being targeted in this way\nAnd what I discovered is that there are actually very few attorneys who are taking these cases in the United states for a whole range of reasons one because I'm the laws often very weak prosecutors aren't prosecuting the cases there is not a lot of support from law enforcement so there's kind of a handful of attorneys working on these cases and everyone was like you have to talk to carry Goldberg\nAnd I was in Brooklyn at the time and she was in Brooklyn to white I baked over and as soon as I met her I just knew\nThat I Want it to someone with her and she revealed at that time that although she just started her own law practice dealing with sexual assault and online harassment thought it had come out of her own experiences and that she was ready to talk about it so that was where\nThe kind of journey with her began I met Tina rainy who also began something with early on in the in the process through an organization called the cyber civil rights initiatives\nThere are so few advocates the organization that help people who are being targeted for harassment they're one of the only ones and when I called them they said we have been in touch with someone who we think might be open to talking to you so Tina was really at the beginning of even\nKnowing that this is a thing that people are going through it that she's not the only one and of course I needed their keys in was one of the women in that radio story I'd heard early one morning about women who were being targeted and\nWho had to leave their homes because of\nReally violent threats to their personal safety\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAnd for her you know she\nAt first I was wondering", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Roundtable", "city": "Albany", "day": "11"}
