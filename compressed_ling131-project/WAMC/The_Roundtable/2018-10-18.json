I think the Saudis have learned that they can do pretty much whatever they want and there won't be consequences\nI'm you know we we were talking a little bit before we went on air just about you know the Saudis have been awful actors for a long long time but just because of our suppose a geopolitical geopolitical needs in our worries about Iran or worries about oil or worries about [noise]\nUh other things we've we've kind of you know treated them could gloves what what's interesting about the Trump I mean Trump was supposed to be all about strength and all about toughness and in this case you have a foreign government murdering a\nUm American resident not an American citizen but at least an American resident who writes for the Washington Post and a response has been anything but tough you know it's just been like hey who knows I don't know [noise] can't can't rush to judgment um\nWhich in a coma captain obvious here but uh I mean the problem is of how many times is administrators shouldn't in particular this president has rush to judgment I mean it's\nIt right well with with our out with with our friends with our democratic allies we rush to judgment with our with our with other dictate with other dictators with dictators he tends not to and it's a it's a little bit of a weird but I like I said he's not the only president who's treated the Saudis with kid gloves\nSo one of the things obviously that that you know kind of following up on your comment is we've had a whole group support horrific war the Saudis are carrying out against the Yemeni population management and bombing indiscriminate bombing of hospitals have kindergartens of community centers\nI mean it is the most one of the most disturbing warrants that it's so under reported\nThe Saudis commit mass murder constantly\nOne wonders why it is that push up she got so much press well the reason is he presided in D.C\nThat is the difference because he suddenly looks like oh he's a member of our society at least he lived here he explains Saudi society to an American audience now if you think of\nThousands and thousands of yeah many being murdered on the most brutal wave or one should not even speak of public execution\nThousands and thousands of many being murdered and the most brutal way or one should not even speak of public executions in Saudi Arabia or those dungeon prison where people\nIncluding women that protested in favor of their right to drive cars have continuously disappeared and been in prison we don't know their status but dogs are unknown human beings they're massive we don't know that faces or name so that stories push up she lived among us that is\nWhen he was a journalist and you know I was gonna say I was a gentleman a journalist in and day quote unquote enemy of the people according to the students were right about that part of the story is a little bit of a strange journalists though because he he kind of play to both of these journals on one hand but at times he seemed to be a spokesperson for the society or for the government even\nAnd yet this is Alan Alan hey good morning on a and\nOne of the things that does occur to me is that you know one of the things that the sociologists have done for years very you certainly know about this as they've gone around and they found out what people think of different countries\nSo when I was in college in the Nineteen sixties the society though was hated by most Americans was the Turks go figure that out I may have been the Muslim thing it may not have been and they may have changed since that time\nBut I think your point is brilliant there and that the the Yemenis are just the invisible to most people in this country nobody knows who they are\nNot many people know how closely involved we are ... with a bombing campaign New York we refuel the jets and that didn't start on the Trump either that started under Obama I mean\nI I think sometimes we since Trump was awful and a lot of different ways we we think he's uniquely awful in every way and in this case I think I mean our our approach to Saudi Arabia is an awful for\nA very long time mhm or at least immoral for very long time absolutely I Would have to agree with you because I'm In the United states we have had a long experience with state violence or violence by the military\nCarried out against the number of countries and we have collaborated with hideous dictators across the world now we were often more quiet about it\nBut the difference now is that President Trump apparently fields um okay but the fact of just making it public knowledge that those are all allies\nYeah and it's it's curious wondering whether that's a good thing or a bad thing I mean he's making it very clear that he considers this relationship to be transactional [laughter] and I think a lot of presidents have used their relationships similarly but they just haven't been willing to say it quite so bluntly\nWell that's that's the thing that I I find interesting in normal times if if we were to back up\nFour six eight twelve fourteen years mhm um and look at this\nSituation like this we would be asking the question that I Would be asking all have you on the panel is what is the long game and the administration what are they trying to do a ... and diplomatic away what is trying to be achieved it doesn't seem like those questions are relevant and those ...\nThey're not they're not what what is at the center it's financial a financial interest investments in Saudi Arabia arms sales um all kinds of deals that Trump may have had in the past the Saudi investors are people\nThat stay at his his hotel and it's his is\nUm buildings that he owns that have purchased some that Saudi has had you know we've got bailed them out or by purchasing and ... you know one of his yacht years ago Twenty years ago when he went bankrupt and those kinds of ...\nThey bailed them out by purchasing and ... you know one of his yacht years ago Twenty years ago when he was bankrupt and those kinds of stories so we know he has had a long financial transactional relationship\nBut as we know it is here as he told us he did he told us he was very specific during the campaign he bragged about all the money that the Saudis had given him and he's just sort of the other day or one of the four thousand in something lies and said I have no I have no business relationship with them\nThat's right he he is the first foreign country he visits after he was inaugurated as president he obviously had a an interesting experience he enjoyed his experience he likes being\nRecorded in countries where they are ruthless dictators in charge of uh the environment he loves to charity he loves ... he ... you know these are the kinds of people he feels comfortable with\nNow what does it mean for the United states it means that we don't even\nReflect on human rights or specific values that we supposedly hold dear\nAs primary in our discussions and our diplomatic efforts in our economic relations\nWere we always achieving goals that we had did we always represent American ideals effectively in on the international in the international arena no of course not we fallen short many times\nUm he was immediately establishing dominance in society\nAnd he has he apparently isn't anger problems\nOr a question for you I think everybody's thinking is the guy knew that he was in real danger yes yes he did and he sent his fiance or his wife or a ... fiance a message indicated he knew right so well he ... he waited\nOutside the embassy right and he told her if I'm not back out in an hour start\nAlerting the Turkish authorities so why did he walking so one of the things that I've read about his life and I I mean obviously I don't know 'cause I never met control gene or do I know what is private life was like but when you are ostracized in from Saudi society he also what disconnected\nFrom old friends from his family his wife are separated from him\nAnd a lot of this happened for security reasons\nUm family members don't want to be executed for what he does elsewhere or how it's perceived so he was very he was feeling very lonely and isolated he was desperately trying to reestablish a family home life\nAnd he met this a Turkish woman fell in love and wanted to marry her and he couldn't do it under Islamic law unless he had specific papers from the Saudi embassy\nThe Saudis knew he had applied for those papers and they flew in the execution team interesting [noise]\nWe have some modification team yeah to go to the doctor apparently who helped or this number the\nYes you wrote and the phone so we have that on video\n[noise] yeah we have letters on those on will ah will go with ozone\nJust says good morning ... the whole issue in regards to the killing of this journalist is ridiculous nothing was done to Saudi Arabia regards to Nineteen and my ... that killed almost three thousand Americans on nine eleven and that's from Jeff in New\nYork ... who were kind of thing I mean we open our position toward Saudi Arabia has been terrible since what the late Nineteen seventies maybe early Nineteen eighties I mean this is not it may have been ... they have gotten the impression that can get away with with any than what they want to do\nYou think it was the because I think that the law is that Americans were said [noise] but yeah there were Saudi Arabians but they were bad Saudi Arabia's much like they're trying to convince the snow that these guys were accused of presidents were rogue\nAnd I think that's the underlying issue for a lot of people that pay close attention to this case\nThe question is really what's the Saudi Government behind that behind nine eleven did they have knowledge did they not did they not share information what did they know when when did that knowing what do you think um [noise]\nYou're this go you know there there are there are a lot of different um comments on that I Am\nQuite sure that there are some members among the uh inner circles who had some knowledge of what was happening and the kinds of cells that we're sending abroad so I'm\nI'm you know I mean I I don't have any clear evidence but uh I'm deeply suspecting that in the inner circle had some knowledge and I was in the process of being plant you know maybe I wasn't in the room\nThe inner circle had some knowledge and I was in the process of being plant\nNow maybe I wasn't in the room but apparently when you guys spoke about this but apparently a there was a payment that was just a major payment yes just me and I'm sure you've mentioned that um the to the United states at the very time\nThat Mike Pompeo and I know that as we have been taught when they go low you don't go lower but I always want to put an adjective Pompeo's\nName and I think it's that's the wrong thing for us to be doing\nYeah I think the payment was a hundred million dollars is how do you just paid to the United states remains at\n... goes over there mhm Mazie optics optics yeah Mexican\nBorder says Ellen ... a good morning panel or the president is threatening to close the border with Mexico if they don't stop people from Honduras dry and end of the u._s. gonna do this he says he will use the U.S military on the border I object to this strongly I think we should have open borders with the world\nWithin reason but closing a border is a shocking an alarming step\nIn my opinion I Would appreciate your thoughts on his I'll go first um and that was cause I'm reading letters not allowed to do that but my first impression has he says with the uh uh Ellen says within reason\nNow if you if you wanna stop in migration quote within reason somehow and I'm not I'm from side on this I think what's been going on is disgraceful is you've got to have some way of stopping people right\nWithin reason yeah well I mean the point is if you want to stop the flow of refugees you might want to do something else besides just closing a border because that flow and you're going to change you might want to look at the root causes of what's going on and address some of those issues to policy initiatives\nI'm not entirely sure what it was I mean this I think she's responding to a series of tweets yeah morning I'm you know those tweets can be kind of hard to figure out what exactly he's trying to say I don't really know a closed the border means I mean if you're not\nTalking about ... trade I mean some of those things would be pretty devastating to the to the limited that's how I I don't really understand and what exactly closing the border\nMe and don't you think it could be a redirect like him you know he's always sending out at these tweets when he doesn't want to talk about one subject or another um and now you know and now he's refocusing in the country on that supposedly for coming north we're right on her door us I mean if so\nIf you truly close the border and we'd be short on fruits and vegetables all winter and [laughter] and people might be a little ...

good morning welcome to the roundtable into our a paddle this morning Alan charged jackets here are very curious Kelly Avon Chris Churchill\nSo the topic that we want to talk about this what has been around for a day or two but uh since we were\nFun driving I Want to get to it today and it's still very much in the news and that is Elizabeth Warren defending her decision to release or DNA test she defended the timing her decision to release the results just ahead of the mid term elections telling the globe\nOn Tuesday that she went public as soon as possible to begin deflecting the constant taunting from the president under Senate challengers I have an election Warren said during an hour long interview with the editorial board Donald Trump goes in front of crowds multiple times a week to attack me both of my opponents have made the same attack\nI get this analysis back and I made it public\nUh and then there are critics I'm On the on the left who say okay but why are you why are you still being to his level why are you playing the games and and it's very reminiscent of\nOf the birth or a and the birth certificates I'm with President Obama and Donald Trump or does it\nDoes it really I don't know I don't I don't know that I agree with that I mean President Obama was clearly an American citizen she I mean it was false claim she is not a Native American I mean it's a it's an accurate claim\nShe might be one sixty fourth Native American according to the test or you as low as one one thousand twenty four but that does not make you\nNative American you know I I you know I understand you're no you're absolutely right my my point being though that that is you get into these you get into these wars with him right he she told her and she basically took debate ... which is what he's very successful and I mean we we saw this with Marco Rubio a mean he\nHe he gives people these nicknames and it gets under their skin and they react in ways that basically does not do them any favors you know I\nI don't know why she released the test I can understand why she took it you know to see you know what but to release it I can to act as though it it clears her of of this accusation\nShe took it you know to see you know what but to release it to act as though it it clears her of of\nThis accusation that's been around against her since I guess since her last a social six years so it's been around since she was going on I don't know\nOkay soon Scott Brown but yeah but it's been around for a long time and it just doesn't clear here at all actually adds fuel to the fire\nI I agree with you but let's assume for a second grade you got a bunch of people sitting around and her campaign staff and\nWhat are they saying okay you want to run for president we got one thing I think that he's using against us so we got to clear that up\n... alone right yeah the new guy right now a Washington\nWhere longtime Washington where the president calls a very fine man highly respected by a lot of people which I think it's pretty much what he says about everybody\nWhat I call it choose your dogs no [laughter] I Know a huge line before the noise meant is I Love the guy right\nIt's not what I call it choose your doors no [laughter] I Know a huge amount of people you know what it's meant is I Love the guy right and that would mean anything either\nHe has the best words they're just lives as often as I said okay let's go to the weather's okay but a lot okay\nYour panel how disappointed the Warren rolled out or DNA test results without any prior consultation with the Native American ruling councils that failure produced a backlash to Turner announcement of Native American ancestry into an embarrassment\nThat will probably short circuit her twenty twenty presidential run what a shame above from Albany but you know what Bob that's interesting and the New York times of course you'll read it this morning a very interesting article in which they said the Native American councils are furious with yes they are and and the the writer correct\nGoes by him and I said before you're not you you can't claim to be a person of color if you're not you can't

I'm the laughter and the I have to say the screaming that comes from the audience all through the show it just never stops which is great as a performer\nAnd watch almost more wonderful then that is when you go out to stage door and there are people waiting\n... I was fortunate that that the the story just went deeper and deeper much more complex and layer multi layered than I ever could have imagined when I started this study nine years ago\nRehman arsenals the author of Arthur Ashe a life\nYou are talking about there's Ninety five boxes of material in the Arthur Ashe papers at the ... Center for black culture at the New York public library and they give you a look into the entire career not just the tennis but into the civil rights activism as well\nUh they do they're pretty heavily weighted to the um the final decades of his life so there's not a great deal about his or his early life and uh but yes it's a you know he was a very public figure and uh\nHis agent Donald Dell or no it was a sort of kept tabs on him and then they were they had clipping services and he had a very wide correspondence and so you really get a sense of the the measure of the of the man of the\nThe extraordinary um diversity of his his his interests and I mean he\n... it's hard to imagine another athletes who could have done more in in forty nine years than than ash you know he he collected first additions\nAnd he was compulsive about doing the New York times crossword puzzle every day you can be sure he was the only one in\nThe in the I think in the locker room doing that [laughter] in on the other tennis store\nAnd he he just had this intellectual curiosity and you see that throughout the papers and throughout his life I I had some of his daily logbooks and I found it almost impossible to believe that he could be so many places\nIn any given week and he'd be at any given day really you know he'd be in Miami in the morning and Los Angeles in the afternoon and somehow next day he'd be a am seeing a benefit dinner in New York and he'd be doing workshops with inner city kids and\nTestifying before the United nations that just went on day one\nStreaming

knew who needed his help\nA star athlete of course and as you mentioned you spend a good deal of time in this book looking at his civil rights activism why do you think that that that part of his wife that part of his um his very public life has been largely ignored\n[noise] well I'm not sure it's been ignored but it's certainly been downplayed and done not fully understood I think there are a couple of reasons one was that he he was such an independent thinker\n[noise] he didn't fit any category I he he for example he he he was not very positive about black power and yet he understood the black power advocates and was willing to uh you know give them cut them some slack so to speak but he thought they were they were you know go says centrally going in the wrong direction\nAnd yet he he he he applauded anyone who would fight for fundamental change within American society relative to race and class and gender\nBut he he never raised his voice you know we never lost his cool uh he was very deliberately avoided emotional is um [noise]\nAnd I think he's so he's he's stood out and uh you know he he didn't he didn't have a booming voice so to speak I mean he found his voice in Ninety sixty eight and turn towards activism and never never never never looked back but he did a lot of it behind the scenes\nYou know he was really a ... he was almost without ego in some respects a a he was all about the uh the ideas about the policies about kind of pragmatic change and\n[noise] I mean he was in some ways he was a radical but I sort of Martin Luther king style radical in the sense that the ... you can almost missed the radicalism until you get to see the the the enormity of the of the commitment and uh [noise] uh how the perseverance of his his work and so many in so many areas but he's often contrast it with my what Ali\nWho actually with ... became a friend of his and\nThey're still different Ali was out there\nYou know kind of over the top and and uh ash was such a paragon of civility and yet in their own way that they were both transformative figures and made tremendous contributions I think to the\nSort of the cultural side of of the the civil rights struggle the struggle for [noise] you know kind of Africa Africa will be some times called the African American freedom struggle the these days\nYou can say this about many people but one of the recurring themes of your book is that in the people that you talk to you and your interviews with people who knew the man the the fact to just knowing him they feel made them better people\nThat's right ah I Can't tell you how many people said that to me\nAnd I don't think there was any conspiracy I don't think they really got together and say they were going to tell me this but an interview after interview they said he was the finest person that they met in their lifetime that he changed them that they only wish they could have been more like him\nA there was one figure who uh send an email just a couple of weeks ago I actually I didn't interview him during the book or a Jim Jim Parker who played with him in St Louis during his senior year of high school when he left Richmond because he he couldn't play against whites there\nJim Parker said he as as a teenager he had such dignity I don't know if I've ever heard of a teenager described in those terms that someone you know sixteen Seventeen years old who had had dignity that they that their integrity what sort of locked into this strong sense of self and ah [noise] ah\nSeventeen years old who had had dignity that the that their integrity what sort of locked into this\nStrong sense of self and a a kind of a deep ... a richness of character and and and personality um and I ... I kept hearing that over and over again um sometimes through tears\nYou know they would just expressed is to me I'm a breakdown at some point in the interview and ...\nAnd apologized to me and say I just always happens to be when I think about Arthur because I miss him so much he was like no other person that I met in my lifetime\nI so I began to think that he's here with somebody really special and not just in the world of sports but one of the truly great Americans of the twentieth century\nIs that a dignified error consistent with your research and how he was brought up man and his trial\nBut I think initially it was imposed a quite a bit by his father who was a strict disciplinarian actually in the early years or if there was a bit scared of his father his mother died when he was six and so father soon large for possibilities for raising him and his younger brother Johnny\n... but then of course when he has to be had to play tennis um he had other coaches are Dr Robert Johnson and others who\n... incorporated this ah control that uh he he he couldn't afford to act out he could have a if a ball was near the line hit by his opponent he always had to call it in that he didn't want they didn't want to racial incident they didn't want him to ruin the chances for those who would\nFollow him so in some ways it was almost like a branch Rickey and as advice of Jackie Robinson and I knew forty six and two forty seven\nUh as you know when it broke the color line in major league baseball that uh he couldn't strike back a and certainly that was true of Arthur I think that was his probably that natural predilection anyway [noise] um but uh it was\nReinforced at I think again and again in his early life and he um he was quite candid about it later and some of his writings about how how much strain that put on him and\nAs he said he wanted he wished so much that he could be John McEnroe for twenty four hours at Wimbledon throwing his racket swearing up to the free he's complaining hum he knew we could never do it but the ... in some ways Mac and it was a kind of alter ego for him and that's I think why they became so close\nOr at the end of his that ten year as a captain of the David cups theme when macro was his his star but Macron was acting out and being sort of a super brat and\nActually had a difficulty in control again but he understood mcenroe is passion is just that Arthur had to keep his passion inside and I think that took its toll on him\nLet us talk about the athletic side of his life in in in general what made him so good wouldn't made him excel on the tennis court\nWell I think as a tennis player he had a he developed a powerful serves perhaps the best serve in tennis in the late sixties and early seventies um which was a strange strange because he was only six foot one a hundred and fifty five pounds and he had been a baseline or early in his life\nHe never rush than it never served in Bali never had much of a serve until he developed at in St Louis and later at UCLA\nAnd sometimes out of the lives of a bunch of good solid who kept telling them hit it harder hit it harder [noise]\nAh and ah he had a tremendous a top spin back end and and he was a very smart player although some people felt that he was he was but Collins called him a thinking man's Dennis Blair and sometimes that got in the way you know he he had he he wasn't as natural in his approach\nAnd sometimes that got in the way you know he he uh he he wasn't as natural in his approach he was he was a great risk taker er which some in some ways belied his image of being so cool and calm and the paragon of civility but he\nLoved to take risks on the court he probably would've won a number of tournaments additional tournaments if he had not been a risk taker he is always looking for the perfect back and and\nHe would sometimes sacrifice the score for just the joy of the game of hitting the the amazing drop shot or the amazing back and volley and uh and I think that made him\nThe most exciting player in tennis in his in his years he wasn't exciting and the way that mcenroe or Jimmy Connors we're in terms of their you know outsized personalities but he I mean in terms of the game it was a it was it was one of the most exciting many of those sports writers made that commentary that uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Roundtable", "city": "Albany", "day": "18"}
