because we have a lot of work to do in a short period of time so we have to make this happen so whatever you can do please do it let's do it [noise]\nWAMC dot org one eight hundred three two three nine to six to with that said what a start our discussion into what is happening in the news today and that we began of course with the uh with the Kavanaugh nomination and the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court\nAnd as the court began yesterday the first Monday in October you will recall\nThere is an investigation going on by the FBI into\nA probe into Brett Kavanaugh and the allegations that have come forward\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThree and two to three slices if you will one is the fact that the White House agreed to expand the cabin up probe slightly as Mitch McConnell has signaled that vote is imminent so we'll we'll get to that part but then\nThere's the avenues of attack which I think are interesting one is the Democratic avenue of attack\nWhich is talking about Brett Kavanaugh's honesty and temperament and is there making I I'm a great deal of that as a result of last week's hearing\nAnd is this man does this men have the temperament and\nWorse did he perhaps a lie on the stand in front of the senators that he spoke before\nThe G O P line of attack of course is the trauma for a man male fury and fear rises and the G O P and the defense of cabin or the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have sparked a wave of unbridled anger and anxiety for many many\nRepublican men who said they are in danger of being swept up by false accusers who are biased against them [noise]\nSo that is our choices are this morning but let us begin with the president who tried tried yesterday to give us some idea of where this probe is headed and what the guidelines are for it\nWell you know Joe it's interesting because um first they tried this move which was to say I'm were limiting the way this thing go here you can talk to and here you can talk to\nThat must have really put them in Fannie because I'm now getting presidents standing up there and say they can go anywhere they want they are absolutely able to do it\nWe need to let them do their jobs um so I think what happened is they got cold on that little gambit of theirs\nAnd and also that when you can go wherever you want to go there's more and more information coming out just about every day every hour that was the most recently the New York times story about his ah his room it was a great deal of\nOf information in regards to seeing him in a ... state a at a time and yell we hear a story this morning about him a in a police report of getting in a bar fight\nOr again in New haven during his time in jail or so a these are all these are all questions that are that are coming up now and as Alan I'm as Alan said yeah so the the the the probe\nTake it where it brings you but there's a lot coming out as this was going on and oh by the way uh they only give them a week which brings it down to Thursday Friday morning\nWell don't don't you think there'll be pressure if if that continues to happen and other people step forward and\nThere's got to be more leads chased\nThat there'll be pressure from people like Jeff Flake again and ah you know Lisa Murkowski or Collins from Maine you know it it it it it it just seems like it's going to be a difficult task if they're going to have a thorough\nMini investigation that might take longer than five days and Mitch McConnell said it again he intends to put robes on judge Kavanaugh before the end of the week and have a vote and this is their intention and he said it before and then it gets delayed said it before and then it gets later\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThough he's not doing that he knows what he has to do it or you can get the last guy through and he's going to get his ... and that's going to be his his that's going to be his pre retirement gift\nRight to Republicans around the world it's about ... and ... and in this country and you know he's not tone deaf to it but what will happen Joe and you make a very good point\nWhat's gonna happen is if he hasn't got the votes\nThere will be one of two ways for him to go either have a low so that he can give some defense to his senators his Republican senators they will at least I voted even though the wind down or he'll call it off oh needs\nOr Kevin are will withdraw that's I think the only way they call it off is if he would throw us well\nNo not necessarily Libby I don't know that he'll call it off I mean I think he has to call it off if he hasn't got the votes and the real question here is Murkowski Collins you know an flake and how ...\nRight but if he doesn't have the votes I think what will happen is they were pressuring him though pressure Kavanaugh to withdraw this is too much of my family right it's too much of my family I didn't ... didn't know what I signed up for blah blah blah blah blah and so that the Republicans in the Senate don't have to take the political hit that they couldn't get him through\nYou know there's there's a strategic reason why he still might have a vote even if Kavanaugh is to lose it would it would establish Kevin ... is a martyr for the Confederate financially and\nIt would also force every I'm sitting senator or even some Democrats in some red states that are facing reelection to vote against Kavanaugh and therefore perhaps a cost them some votes in the mid term election mhm\nI agree with both of you in the ... it's hard to imagine that this thing that's going to wrap off by the end of the week\nAnd time is really not on the side of ... cabin on every day that goes by there is and there are new revelations in his new revelations that come out might not be deadly in uh in isolation death by a a thousand cuts south by south and cuts the fact that that\nThe vetting wasn't on ... to find police records of a bar fight for him back to yell this would have been huge news two weeks ago before the allegation so\nNot only time not working for Brett Kavanaugh but time is and also also isn't working for the Senate Republicans and President Trump is Brett Kavanaugh is not going to be that our Supreme Court justice they need to get rid of him as soon as possible to get the next person opposite they can hopefully approve them before the next Senate comes\nOkay so let's talk about let's talk about the political implications of this is in fact Kevin Noah goes down who wins who loses in other words you you\nSee what I'm saying I'm like oh I Do I mean you you have to think that if the if the if there is that the vote and it and they do not vote to\nApprove Kevin offer the Supreme Court it'll cause a backlash and bring a lot of people who are Trump supporters\nAre out because there'll be angry and it might actually make it on less favorable for the Democrats in the midterms mhm or on the other hand white this law might um bowling the Democrat out and be more favorable or all three\nRepublican [laughter] Murkowski Collins and and flake vote against him it gives cover to the two Democrats who are still on the fence because it'll still end up being fifty one forty nine and so they may look mansion and hike camp which I'm not\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAre saying that if the three Republicans voted ... Kevin ... two Democrats form like lord how will that happen so you'll know what the outcome\nAnd it's not going to have you know I Know I mean that's just the now the Senate was going to have it all\nThree are not going to vote a vote they would they need is one right and if they get one doesn't that leave the vice president's filled with\nYeah Todd asked you need to yes you're\nRight so sleep seems to me to be the most promising although we keep hearing on the TV or the White House schemes reaching out to flake and that flake is bid on them on the phone with a with the president and everybody else so if a person yet and they will be\nUh see I I'm working on the premise\nAnd um and I guess she's waiting in the wings suitcase Kevin ... is a a you know nomination false through but the interesting thing is that Kevin I wasn't on that that list uh that that's right then\nThat list uh that that's right then to Trump was promising to pick from he was a late addition after Trump was elected\nAnd the interesting thing is that he's he's very much in favor of presidential power and rhymes and might be very favorable on the court should there be a question about whether the president might have to testify under oath et cetera\nAnd that that that was perhaps\nYou know a lot of people speculate that was one of the reasons Trump kind of fast track to Kevin off the the other aspect of it is once you you kind of invest a lot he was nominated back during I think in in may\nOr may or June and you've invested a lot of time and effort into this and you don't want to lose it and then perhaps not have enough time even after the election to a slam through a a another candidate\nA so they may end up having I'm losing this one in ... another one so I guess they're they're sticking with him right now\nWell I mean you know I I Am astounded by the president's occurrences like have it all it does sound to me like he's not a hundred percent where he'd probably ought to be and they must know something we'll roll yet that's my bet on\nHe's occasionally shaky on a missing a yeah he is kind of throw them under the bus\nAnd Trump also was a guy who was never drank and his life and she uh I don't think thinks of people that drink and act this way in their use like a the picture has been paying Brett Kavanaugh I think it makes Trump lose respect for him\nAnd he has thrown his closest advisors over the boss numerous times in his first year and a half in office and it would certainly be happy to throw traveling all over the boss if you thought it advantage of it anyway\nWhy over not under you know I Know they don't have the same effect from over the last hundred yeah I Know\nIt says it isn't there something in poker called under over and yeah yes I have no idea what it is right but it but I but I Do think that this is a mess for um\nFor the president and you know his older brother read this morning in his older brother Fred was an alcoholic who died from alcoholic rather than that's part of the that's part of the other thing we\nAdmitted that he's talked about that um and and it had a profound impact on him and he doesn't touch alcohol he said jokingly yesterday said that's about the only good thing about me I don't touch alcohol and people laugh\n[laughter] one of the few things he and I have a comment and ... and our friend Kevin says just Seventy isn't it about getting capital seated to allow the sovereignty quotes SCOTUS issued to go through\nI don't know what exactly sovereignty or has to do with unless they're talking about presidential power\nYeah it could be I think that's probably what he what he intent as in sovereign as anything you\nSee Kevin I might have avoided some of the city had um said he would recused himself from any um specific uh issues\nBefore the court about presidential power\nBut he he was elected not to argue owners or he ... he wasn't going to do that but you know I think that the arrogance of the guy was that he assumed any play them very close to the heart role or he did very well in the confirmation hearings but when you saw him\nA unbridled the other day in in this federal thing honestly had died on America could think that he has a judicial temperament visit\nI have the temperament and the a and the respect for people that the uh some some wind surfing moments in his in his interactions with especially the Democratic senators although even a ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThat's hard to undo um and it's a ... I mean it's one of the things we were talking about this there's these two lines of attack one is the Democratic line of attack that says he doesn't have the temperament to be adjusted there is of course the the questions are before us that they're investigating regarding\nThe alleged sexual assault but also there's the temperament and the honesty how many times did he did he live before that body and ... you know and and are those lies to the level of of not\nSeeing him on the Supreme Court also\nYou have the GOP line of attack which says look we we can if if it is every guy and this is Republican men um is is every guy here I'm\nGoing to just get get washed up and and me too and and the concern um and it seems like they're taking a gamble on that as to whether it can be worked for them and the midterms\nI Would love to go around this room right now and hear your view on whether you just separate them whether Kevin ... is going to be approved a and based on the evidence that you've seen up\nAnd up until now my view is you have to think was and we think we know and all the negatives in every bit of his appearance before that committee that he's going to get approved that's what I well I\nI'm leaning that his candidacy is going to fail or his nomination is going to fail I but but I was your wish or is that you know no no no no no I mean I'm just trying to judge it I I if I had to bet right now\nI'd I'd bet with very close sides that he's not going to become the next Supreme Court justice but it would not at all surprised me if I'm wrong it's it's by no means a black and white issue it's really up in the air\nYou know I heard of before you go before you go in and just say the old saying from your lips to God's ear now go Ajay I agree with\nMine and I think that it's a it's through his first initial thirty two hours of testimony I watched him I thought he was extremely capable qualified person\nAnd what is uncover over the last couple of weeks any other any of these instances in isolation might be able to be explained away but you put it all together it can't be explained away and other things back to George point about him being disingenuous and dishonest I understand\nYou took a guy like Donald Trump she knows how to live he's been doing it his whole life he's good at it but Kavanaugh certain answers especially when he said he never blacked out drunk [laughter]\nIt just wasn't a forthright solid lie he was not he's not good at it he's not comfortable out and I think that everybody on TV you could tell that that was a tough thing for him to say for me\nI think it's a crap shoot I think that they could go either way based on [noise] ... and ... and ...\nBut it was a political analyst you're supposed to be able to tell and I can't you see those\nDo I see those people I think more ... will end up voting against him I think\nLike I don't think Collins well unless she gets incredible pressure so she's um she where they are getting and I think flake wants to run for president and I think he's doing the calculus of\nYou know what does this mean to Republican women right and Republican women and all the ... the the work that's come out recently I think that me two boys will be boys groping arts\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured

know my general philosophy of life right now what is that general philosophy they said well if you don't want to hit back then [laughter]\nAnd they will be happy\nLives now what about Andrew Cuomo would you say you kept saying you didn't want him to get elected and when you hit so did you really want him to get what you know sometimes you know that doesn't\nThat 'cause I was wondering what we call a double triple quadruple [laughter]\nUm we're all fake and I know it's just that I agree I I really agree with Mike and I'm but and and I so I have a I keep on going back on this thing about cars Murkowski the fact that Murkowski said after the mentioned this moment ago the Murkowski said after the hearing that she was still for him\nI I just I mean this to me that was just the most ... uh\nI don't know what's what's to come out of this over the next ... that's worse than what we saw last Thursday so that gives me great well except\nJoe it's the pressure it's the ... of letters to eat it is is the number of people who call your office so that your phone has to be taken off the hook it up the idea that this protest in front of the places what let me said before about you know about in in the case of Alaska you know the the um [noise]\nIn in the population really doesn't like this guy\nRight and we underestimate the power of the um the majority leader to uh you know basically pour water on other things that you want to get done for your state in ... and funding that you're trying to get her bills here trying to get past and he put very very subtle pressure on you to ah [noise]\nYou know to lean his way and then you'll be rewarded and let's\nNot forget Susan Collins flooded the right way on Obamacare\nAnd who knows what kind of sort of ... you got for for that you know and now she and she's up in two years\nI'm not trying to ... where where it comes down is whether or not he was portraying himself as something and ignoring a lot of\nFactual information and trying to portray himself as good as alter boy kind of person and it turns out that you know he really was\nSo much couldn't go wrong here and couldn't turn out that sweating ... has issues and now

ness\nFor everybody if their concept is nothing like anything I've ever seen at any other sport event and even if they're losing their rooting for the folks who just beat them\nAnd I think that's all that is all political and it is rooted in a sense of community and you mentioned before you know that this is a competition movie and it is to some degree\nBut I Would also argue that it isn't primarily a competition movie\nOh no sure I mean that probably was my original notion was probably a pretty conventional I started in two thousand twelve the next gay games which are kind of the Olympics at the same sex world is coming up and twenty fourteen and that's kind of the big enchilada for ballroom dancers [noise]\nUm and I probably intended that that's what we're this would combination but in point of fact it didn't end up working in that way and I kept shooting for almost another two years after that so that I think at heart the film is really about the characters\nBut there is that kind of hopefully solve excitement that you get because we do follow them to\nTo the big come without without saying exactly what happened [laughter] so we see what happens in the film but I'm not going to say\nOh no no yes of course we can't give that a way yes that's what I I I didn't say that that way but yes you're right about your movie [laughter]\nIt gets too hot not the dramatic piece of the competition but also very character driven and we we watch these dancers we learn a lot about them you learned a lot about them would you do you count them as friends now feels like you're so invested and present in their lives\nAbsolutely I Do count them as as friends very close friends in some cases\nAnd you know we went on this long journey together and they welcomed me into the world with incredible candor and openness and that was a gift and that was one that I took very seriously and you know none of them saw the film until it was complete so\nAnd of course we shot over a four year period so I think by the time they saw it on the big screen which was the first place they all thought at a festival they've forgotten that he's a thinks it's [laughter] or\nKnew it was a very emotional experience um which they've come back because they come around to me just screenings with to as much as possible they come with me and we do audience cue and AIDS together and so we've been on this whole trail through festivals for the past year and now at our theatrical run\nAnd so they keep reliving this\nAnd it's very powerful for them and every now and then somebody will cringe and say oh gosh I wasn't I'm not sure how I feel about having had that revealed but in the end I think they all felt incredibly proud and positive and that they were represented with with integrity which you know I was\nDreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot

yes I Do consider them to be friends and they're very much in my life and um [noise]\nYou know they weren't sure along the way if I was going to finish right was it was very difficult to um financially to get the film finish and so I hear I was I Would show up as secure she is again I guess she means it okay or she is again in a few other people have tried to make a film about this world and had not finished\nAh for various reasons so some of them had actually a particularly a Emily and Karen my lead I'm female dancers who are based on the west coast\nThey'd been through this a couple of times before and so at first I think they didn't know how seriously to take it they were willing to do it they were thrilled that someone wanted to make a movie about this world that is so important to them\nBut I think it was probably\nYou know a couple of years before they realized I asked you really in Tennessee only attempt to make this happen and\nAnd so now I mean we've been all over the world together I mean we've been to London together into New Zealand and you know all of this country so it's become a close personal relationship and that's great I mean to me that's one of the play offs for for this work is getting to know\nExtraordinary people who you might well not know otherwise\nIn addition to being a strong el GB T.

over the course of the film only one of them was born in the United states\nYou know I didn't set out to have that the a strong element in the film but it became a really important sub team a and yes that this is about diversity and inclusiveness of of many kinds [noise]\nYou know I think a number of um first of all dances the or in some ways in Europe than it is in America and virtually every child um studies dancing as a kid um which isn't necessarily true here although you you see it more and more here but\nIt's it's much more common I'm In Europe\nAnd more common for for male children in Europe than male children in the United states\nOh yes yes I mean you know Ernesto and ... and robbed the all danced as small boys um and there was no stigma attached to that whereas sometimes hear their their yet might be [noise] so I think you know there is that that that dance world is very much embedded in their culture but\nEqually um and not surprisingly I think a number of them came to the United states because they perceived that it would be more open and more tolerant and that there would be more opportunities for them\nI mean ... talks about the fact that in in his native

dancing with women and in fact he married his first dance partner and he and she came to United States as young people um\nAnd I think actually I live I don't think they were Nineteen I think they were twenty two because he was out of college but they came here because another Russian had open to dance studio here and they had the opportunity to teach and to compete\nAnd to live much for your life and Nicolas closet at that point he knew he was gay but he was trying to live in the street world um and\nThat persisted for for quite a long time and even after he\nOstensibly had come out here when we first meet him at the beginning of the film he's still not comfortable in his own skin even though he's in America and he's successful and he's got a good life but he still is struggling with his identity and with the fact that his family I'm back in Russia\nHas a hard time with this and he can he can sort of barely bring himself to say the word\nGay and I think over the course of the film his\nArc I mean they all have things that happened in their lives and we went along with that not knowing where would it would lead us but I I think perhaps Nikolai has the most dramatic personal arc in terms of how he is also that the course of the film\nHe ends up someplace in very different than where we first found him but I think for all of them coming to America was as it has been for it you know how many hundreds of years an effort to have a better kind of life and you know what I started this film which was in the pre Trump era\nI thought that it would be\nRelevant and resident but
