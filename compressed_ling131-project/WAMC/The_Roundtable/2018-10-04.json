the best thing that ever happened because it takes time off the fund drive\nAnd that's what and in these days especially yeah really got to have the radio station\n... the the fund drive takes time off of our lives but the fund drive just takes time off of of actually lock boxes take time off to find that's that's the way that works um in the point Joe yes\nSo um where do we uh oh so we are doing well okay good so um we've already made some money excellent so uh we need to be at the er\nThe um let me just quickly we have three ten if we do\nThis over ten three will have gone crashing

Judy and I were talking about it like when you visit somebody at the present you leave your cell phone out you can't bring Penn or paper\nYou just go in and Adam enlightened as much as to memorize when you when you depart right\nNow the president said overnight at a two fifty in the morning or something that he is fully confident of the Senate will confirm Kavanaugh who's confirmation process has been roiled by the allegations allegations of three women about his behavior\n... for more ah more than three decades ago the president the White House are firmly behind Brett Kavanaugh according to Raj Shah who said this during a an appearance on CNN\nOr saying that we believe that all of a sudden has questions have been addressed through the supplemental FBI investigation so uh the Republicans have the first crack at it than the Democrats have the have their turn to\nTo watch ... I I heard Grassley gets it and then the ... and then it goes down through the ranks yeah yeah but all one hundred senators can well they must 'cause that's already cleared the committee\nTake forty eight hours for everybody to have access like actually from work at it for an hour than Democrats or an hour and the other hand it Akron our mhm the sixes and that's my problem\nThe FBI got instructions\nWhich I Believe um were compromised so that they couldn't despite the presidential rhetoric go where they wanted to go so there were certain things that they were told they couldn't do so for example we're hearing on the news this morning that they were told they could not look into a Kevin always drinking um issue\nIf that's true if that's the case uh then um and and the whole question of whether he lied under oath about drinking that certainly skews the with the results of this of this um uh FBI report\nBut might have but given all the anecdotal information we're hearing on the news a admittedly not under oath to my knowledge could that not be enough to be ... to to give ... ... the senators who are teetering\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nEverybody here do you think you'll be confirmed and\nEverybody in the room I believed Joe when may have been ... on that boat said yes no he will not be confirmed and I said yes he will be confirmed and here's my reasoning\nThat um every if you take a look at all the Republican polling it's a huge wipe out of Republican women and men who are opposed who are for a capital who want Kavanaugh to get confirmed\nEvery one of those people including Susan Collins who I Believe Joe you could look this up is up for reelection in two years\nI'm ... knows that if they go wrong on this they're going to get slaughtered in a primary so they're going to do what they have to do to to ah to survive we have words for people like this but this is a family program so I'm so I'm I'm not about I'm not about the same them\nBut but to me it's it's in Contra vertical ... you need two votes because if you only get one by the way than the vice president breaks it breaks the tie\nSo where are those two votes coming from [noise]\n... [noise] well I still hold out some hope although I fear greatly Allen might be right on that but I Hope\nThat they are it during the period of the question which ... which will follow obviously there's a ... I think it's already hour period of discussion following the access to the FBI reports are these sort of you know pages that they have limited access to [noise]\nI Hope that that will be some reflection on the part of I'm Susan Collins a Murkowski\nAnd it's like um [noise] I think they are still undecided the three\nWell you know you could be right I could be wrong or the or the less good thing is very interesting a senator from Alaska has a shot at a survival yes if she decides not to go with it but I Can't see where the other folks are coming from\nSo the reason for uh like I don't you think it has to do with um the strong\nNative American in a constituency or Lisa Murkowski she needs them and they're the Native American community\nAnd Alaska deeply upset about some of Kavanaugh's views on the rights of indigenous people\nBut I brought this up yesterday ... after the hearing after Thursday's hearing we some Murkowski said that she was leaning toward voting for Kavanaugh I mean that if you wonder what could possibly come out\nAnd then I prefer this FBI report and what has come out over the next week that would tip the other that us Allan mentioned yesterday the pressure on her because that will that be enough\nYeah I mean I I don't I'm not sure how to read sort of comments and the media leaning towards because\nLeaning towards me ... I Believe in a very means I'm going to vote for\nFor I don't know flake said something similar and then he leaves the other way and\nI Want to know what it's all voted voted to for the for the for\nYou know he should as he shook his finger at everybody and said what the president said his language was disgraceful and a lot of other people have gone on to that but in the end he's leaning to yes yep\nYou know on was asking me earlier right why look so somber falling and it was because it's not so much you know the appointment to the Supreme Court but it's um but it's the fact that all the cases that were behind the president the night\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nCitizens of this country who are who are not buying into the fact that women are sexually assaulted and harassed and the fact that the Republicans are looking at polling saying hey this is okay it's the blowback for me to remember that and I think I think it's a serious threat to two women\nI couldn't agree more you know when I when when Joe's nice enough to invite me to come up here and I'm driving up thinking about what I might say and I'm thinking I got to find something that's insightful or humorous or or whatever\nAnd I find that this subject and that that particular rally and on and the the sham of the investigation that the FBI apparently has been ordered to do\nIs so disturbing it it's just I don't even know what to put into words and now that doesn't make for good radio because you want which we all want to sound like we know we're talking about but it's just demoralizing what's going on in this country\nOkay so let's talk about the political implications of all of this we are now hearing I'm from a very good pundits and analysts\nThat if he is the night to get the nomination that the Republican base will rise up as one or two protest it in the midterm elections\nAnd there are some holes that are suggesting that what's happening\nRight so the irony here is\nThat if he gets it the Republican base doesn't rise up as one because they're now they're not angry\nYou know about it so ironically if irony is the right word I Know Judy when you have your red pencil ironies or you you cross out on a lot you know in in in articles um the irony of this is if he gets in it is\nPossible that both houses of Congress will go democratic that is why politics is such a crowd it's horrible [noise]\nIt's you you see what for all the ... during the um Clarence Thomas euro and then Clarence Thomas got in and he's been on the court now for almost Twenty years and you can get into that and he'd get into any silent and they're now or ... the historians will have to remind me\nDid the Republicans pay for Clarence Thomas getting through was that one of the\nUpheavals in the Congress I I don't remember what it was yeah they are used in well that was the ... the year though but I as I said it as an as Judy said better than I Do the the spectacle of\nOr we need a just under fourteen thousand dollars for the really cool thing is we're over three hundred thousand dollars in the last Oh yes yes well that's really cool\nThat's good but it's not cool enough or because we kinda get that we have to get to the five hundred thousand dollar more right it won't be easy\nNo it won't be we're going to do our part this morning everybody's going to do it and I I think you'll be happy I mean in in forty minutes from now\nI Hope so I Hope so I think we can [noise]\nOkay ah do let's do a few letters and we'll have news and then we'll be good to go okay\nBruce he says depressing take for Nate Silver team the depressing ... dot com they chose Silver's website\nThat whichever side wins the capital confirmation of fight will be disadvantaged on November ... the the Kevin outcome will and rage one side of the other the more enraged party will do better on November six if we when we lose if we lose we win\nOf the uh front you and it said they were ... ugly part of politics that really nasty side reality here\nAnd Joe says I'm very nervous I've heard that the Republicans are more United and galvanized because of the capital situation\nHere's my take on it if Kavanaugh wins confirmation more Democrats will be inspired to vote and have a chance at taking at least one house and Congress is confirmations defeated however angry Republicans are going to come out to vote in droves and not only keep the Congress but even may even gain seats what are your thoughts first of all we've talked about that yeah we all agree with you\nOr at least I agree with you I think I think you're right\nI'm On the other hand or the Republicans had a change a choice here\nGo with them and lose the midterms or or or um ... to him and when the midterms and that's their decision\nThey want a conservative judge to change the face of the Supreme Court wherever they will worry about the consequences of that is right\nFor ever they have certain okay Jordan says panel amazing how the target keeps moving on this guy says ... can't seem to make anything stick and that's from Georgia and Bob\nSays uh FBI report on Capitol maybe senators can tell the public what's not in the FBI report on Capitol yeah and that's something we're all thinking about is there are they going to be leaks\nYeah I mean it will likely be what not and not report\nA Senator Schumer supposed to have a press conference that it wasn't a clock and talk a

jobs away it will also create millions of new jobs make production more efficient and kick start entire new industries\nSo the countries that invest in automation early and and the training that helps workers transition to new types of jobs\nCould really jump ahead economically that's partly why automation is a huge part of the Chinese government's made in China twenty twenty five initiative that's the country's plan to reduce its reliance on outside technology and create a tech economy that rivals the west\nAutomation is an especially big deal in China because there's so much manufacturing there it's sometimes referred to as the world's factory marketplace correspondent Jennifer pack has been giving us updates on China's parallel tech economy from her post in Shanghai I asked her how big a deal the transition to automation might be for China\nThere are some estimates say that China's GDP will be boosted by twenty percent uh in twenty thirty of course that comes at a cost an estimated one fifth of change jobs in the manufacturing sector alone will be replaced by automation so that nearly a hundred million workers who have to switch jobs by twenty thirty\nWhat about retraining one of the things that we hear is that when there's displacement that there has to be re training for people who were displaced by automation is there a sense that companies or even the government is going to help with that\nI haven't heard of any comprehensive plan China's push\nHas always been towards entrepreneurship at least in the private sector\nAnd they've been encouraging people to venture out into the Internet economy and make their own things so a lot of the talk is that what great things could automation and artificial intelligence do for our society or it could release you of the mundane job so that you can go and innovate\nSo what solutions overall does China's government have in terms of pushing automation forward\nWell China's government they're not necessarily pushing for automation it is however a focus more on high tech manufacturing that's what they're pushing for under this plan called made in China twenty twenty five which is at the center of this trade dispute with the U.S so they are encouraging\nFactory to use new technologies now of course the byproduct of automation\nBut remember this is coming at a time when China's workforce is aging rapidly and a lot of the many factors we've been speaking to when we try to\nAsk him about this a trade dispute with the U.S how worried they are the first thing they talk about is not about that\nThey're talking about how difficult it is defined as stable working force because a lot of the young people they don't want factory jobs they are asking for less overtime unlike they ... they want weekends off which is not\nA usual thing for a Chinese factories so a lot of the manufacturers are complaining that is very tough for them to find workers and so that's why when we speak to some of these factories they say automating is not so much about saving money it's a matter of survival\nJennifer ... marketplaces China correspondent based in Shanghai the automation there is coming fast

lot of Shakespeare in your career and this is British put very different how did you get ready for the dialect for the ...\nIf it's sunny initially when I came to the audition they asked for a Yorkshire accent and I think it was just a blanket way of getting everyone in that world but ultimately I ended up doing a London accent sort of two separate dialects of a London accent\nI watched 'em happy valley a lot [laughter] amazing the beach so set in or near you or I'm not exactly sure where it's at but um\nI left their accent that I listen to that a lot and then when I had to shift or I just\nI like to find actresses and people who are interesting to me and hear how they speaks I listened to Carey Mulligan I listened to Jemma archer ten I listen to 'em Haley Squires so I just kind of did some research for how we wanted to sound and then\nUltimately I think for me I've done a lot of dialects and it's the final piece of the puzzle and perhaps the most important piece is that it feels like my voice you can I'm not a very good impersonators so I can learn sounds from other people but ultimately it only helps me if I can incorporate it into my own\nNo rhythm or or figure out how it sounds like me even if it's not how I speak normally\nThe play revolves around the game of of new ... new gr which that that oh there's a bit songs something I don't remember what show it is

game before during the play\nI knew nothing about the game I'd never heard of it um I have family in England and they weren't really aware of it either they don't live in London and they just don't really follow the the game and my grandfather was English\nAnd I found out later that from my mother that he played a lot during the war I think it was it was something that was originally they believe was invented during\nAnd I get this wrong during World War one I Believe in India um you know there's discrepancies about who invented it but the English think they invented it would wouldn't
