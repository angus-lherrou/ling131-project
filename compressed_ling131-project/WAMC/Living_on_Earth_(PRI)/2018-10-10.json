due to funding concerned how did you react when you heard the news\nI was profoundly disappointed profoundly disappointed\nSo there were two parts to this project what is the undersea network that provides the initial near real time warning and then the second is the network of electronic devices essentially\nA cell phones handheld cell phones that enable people in the community to communicate as they evacuate or move to safer ground\nWe had planned to do the deployment this fall September October the Indonesian agency being cagey was very interested in this proposal you know unfortunately the project is currently on hold until more funding comes in\nSo it's like that everybody agreed that people should wear seatbelts but that wasn't enough money for everyone to have one\nUnfortunately that's exactly the case\nAs I understand that there was a system of booties there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful parts of this project um Indonesia supported by the U.S in Germany had twenty two movies\nThat were operating and design actually to provide a similar data from the ocean floor change in the water pressure in the water column\nBut those buoys actually had been vandalized\nAnd we're not functioning and as a matter of fact the Marines survey agency BP T that manage the movies actually cancelled that program\nBecause they were not able to keep them operational so the boys had not been operating since two thousand sixteen\nNow what are the advantages of the system that you've helped to develop over this now defunct system of bullies\nThe major difference is it is anchored to the ocean floor so it cannot be vandalized and it uses a very interesting scientific phenomenon of the thermal kind of warm equatorial waters\nTo enable who's the communication that is underwater communication where the data is transmitted from the sensors to another communication center\nTo another communication sensor and then picked up and transmitted via cable to land station that transmits the data via satellite\nAnd of course the coast of communication in the water is what the whales do\nExactly that is exactly right\nTo what extent has the prospect of now the Indonesian government changed given this recent disaster\nWell I Hope it has changed right now I'm certain that\nThey're full attention is on the immediate recovery but you

a negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shells and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world\nAre we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate of impact we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic\nImpact and so that's why we owe it particular respect and concern\nThe second grade impact is pollution general pollution\nPeople build the building near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution\nYou have run off the of gasoline runoff from stations who have oil run off you have pesticide runoff you have high nitrate runoff which affects the level of oxygen in the water and therefore the fashion plants a foreigner in the ocean\nAnd we have five hundred dead zones around the world and the ocean's today dead zone nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload\nAnd also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds I've seen film of a shark send or board buses end or whales dragging nets around and dragging plastic around it's crazy\nAnd then finally we have over fishing\nWe have too much money chasing too few fish\nAnd that's one of the reasons we may cod anymore here eight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of the sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones and the others or at or near\nMax so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class who now have discovered blue tuna and sushi\nOr with four hundred million Indians likewise and people around the world gaining in income and then therefore appetite we have a huge challenge an already about ... percent protein that people get in the world comes from fish\nSo there's a huge demand for fishes food stock and increasingly we're going to see pressure on that so those are the Big East but the pollution is just stunning I mean if we continue at the rate we're going there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and twenty thirty\nYears now of course you've had a storied career most recently as a diplomat and your background I think he spent some time in France and Switzerland as a kid and your dad was a diplomat\nBut when it comes to the ocean you've had some special concerns and I just want to quickly ask you about ... about to one there's something called the law the sea treaty\nWas something that the United states and folks from Massachusetts like LA Richardson worked on years ago which we never ratified and now there's talk of having

it off it rises to the topic and an till it gets tangled in a whale or tangled in the propellers of some boat [noise]\nIt's a scourge and we have no enforcement on those high seas or very little
