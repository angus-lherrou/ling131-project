University Welcome back to living on earth Michel thanks deep it's good to be with you so why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or we're looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat waves and an ocean heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the planet\nA hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into storm surge these days well\nYou know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast or has been somewhere between half a foot and a foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy and twenty twelve at at at a ... foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge might sound like a modest amount or one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding they've been several\nBillion dollars worth of additional damage um same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will be storms be particularly the hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quick pop up\nOne of the things that we're seeing with warming warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we've seen this now so many times where a storm balloons from a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane over the course of a day or two\nAnd that only happens over very warm sees and are we getting more\nOf these very intense storm these category ... you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest in fact there's a relationship\nFor a category five storm you get an increase of roughly seven percent in the maximum wind speeds for each degree Fahrenheit warming of the ocean now that seven percent increase in wind speed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm\nGoes as the third power of the wind speed\nSo it was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential of the storm that's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures if you do the math\nThat means it was probably twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of human caused warming\nNow the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report is saying that the world faces perhaps more severe climate impacts of global ever surface temperatures rise more than one and a half degrees Celsius both the pre industrial temperatures what do we know now about how hurricanes could behave\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I no ... no poll dog harness invented to make a lot easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands every means at my dog hunt S. dot com\nThere that's a Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storm\nThat means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius you have a about four percent more moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting\nUh lots of other weather extremes and global sea level rise and all of these other attributes of climate that we are sensitive to\nIn the past or the PC has been the conservative that when the data comes into the projections have been uh been lower than the actual uh numbers how do you think this report will fare or when the actual data comes in\nYeah so I I've criticized this latest report or for once again being overly conservative and its portrayal of the science and and I'll tell you it has to do with a very specific criticism in this case it's the way that they measured the warming that has happened and the PCC has chosen\nTo measure the overall warming that's taken place\nUsing a baseline that starts in the late Eighteen hundreds and and the reason for that is well that's how far back with their mom and her measurements go here's the problem human caused warming began back in the Seventeen hundreds when you know industrialization began so every tenth of a degree Celsius\nOf warming that's happened makes it that much more difficult to stabilize below one point five maybe it's impossible now one point
