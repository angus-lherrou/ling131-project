welcome back to the program Patt thanks tape good to be with you\nKnow justice Brett Kavanaugh has been closely related to a number of environmental cases why why is that\nWell he's been on the DC

which\nProbably for the navy and dealt with either environmental law directly or administrative law issues that relate to environmental laws so he has quite a track record of writing opinions and environmental cases\nSo typically how has justice Kavanaugh ruled on these regulatory cases involving environmental law\nWell he styles himself in the manner of uh the late Justice Scalia who was attached to a less strict construction is and what that means of course is that he looks to the text of a statue when he was asked to interpret it\nAnd if the text isn't clear enough oftentimes he

five seven five one zero to register\nThe premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nThis report has an unusual origin the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change produces thorough assessments of all our knowledge on climate change\nEvery six years or so and then in between those major assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next these are called special reports and I'm working on the next special report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets\nThe report that just came out is on the question of what is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high\nThat we may just as a group of societies not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed it at single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest I PCC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or they'll twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reach a net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there\nAnd I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people and the report they frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has has put on it\nIs sort of like twelve years ago we don't do we should do the world comes to win and that's not the case reality is at every step you do the best you can and if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to win and costs that is the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually\nThat doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands states but it'll make life just miserable extensive\nAnd uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of limiting warming to a degree and a half centigrade\nContrary to what most people think ah the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological the costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible but\nThe real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organize to actually reinvent themselves to be not independent of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what in fact do we need to do then as society is as governments to to limit this warming I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nThe most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means getting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including ... robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nAnd probably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere\nThat even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminated dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards mid century\nIt seems we go in and need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was\nCalled for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of\nScientists were skeptical that there would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half and two degrees but because the government's called for the report a lot of scientists went out\nAnd started doing research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nAnd flooding that they were big differences between one and a half and two degrees I mean give me an example already by one and a half degrees there are places are particularly islands in the Pacific and megacities all around the world for which the incidence of the
