she went to Puerto Rico nine months after the storm met some small farmers who lived through it and we're still working to rebuild\nEven before Hurricane Maria uprooted trees and people Puerto Rico imported roughly eighty five percent of Its Food after the storm that number shut up to Ninety five percent imported food if you could get it many people are forced to skip meals and each shelf stable and canned food\nFor months [noise] nine months after the storm one of the only places to find locally grown food on the island it's farmers' markets like the Saturday market and ran cone and Puerto

ground plants like pineapple were among the first to recover and fast growing vegetables like salad greens are easy enough after the hurricane visitors came to Puerto Rico with their suitcases full of

need to go back to the Nineteen forties and a U.S initiative called operation bootstrap\nWould the colonization of the U.S there was a movement to get people out of their farms and into the city is\nNot only my shell is the documentarian for the resilience funds in Puerto Rico she says operation bootstrap transformed Puerto Rico from a largely agrarian economy to one based on manufacturing and tourism [noise] they did that with a patchwork of government tax incentives and access to us markets\nScientists focused on how divergent species inherited characteristics as genes were passed and sometimes mutated from one generation to the next\nWell we know life can be complicated so we should not be surprised that evolution is not just based on the tree of life than inherited genetics\nWe learned in the Nineteen seventies that there are creatures that are kind of in between single celled bacteria and multi cellular creatures like humans a category of life called archaea that could hold the key to how life got started on earth\nAnd out scientists discovered horizontal gene transfer\nWhich changes genomes by a sideways infection sometimes across species\nAuthor David Quammen tells the story of this new understanding of evolution in his book the tangled tree a radical new history of life\nDavid joins us from Bozeman, Montana welcome to living on earth\nThank you Steve very good to be with you so what is the story that you set out to tell\nWell it's the story of the tree of life as the image of evolutionary history on earth which\nGoes back to Darwin and the way that image that tree has been radically challenged and radically revised in the last forty years because of discoveries from genome sequencing a kind of evidence that Darwin and most biologist in the twentieth century didn't have\nAnd those challenges have been astonishing counter intuitive and have reshaped what we thought we knew about the history of life on earth\nTo summarize I think it's fair to say a big takeaway here is that what we think of as species what we think of as individuals and for that matter the whole tree of life where evolution show species neatly diverge increments origin well not exactly right why is that\nThat's putting it politely I say at the end of the book after having told these stories of these people in their discoveries that this whole revolution has challenged three categorical ideas and that's the idea of species the idea of\nIndividual and the idea of the tree of life the idea of species that it's a unitary thing it's a population of creatures that are similar to one another and they injure breed with one another\nAnd only with one another the idea of an individual there is an individual named Rufus the brown dog there is an individual named Charles Robert Darwin there was an individual Steve Kerr would David Quammen\nAnd we are a unitary in discreet and thirdly the tree of life represents the history of life on earth that is a tree shaped history and it turns out that all three of those ideas this categorical Z are wrong in important\nWays you know it's tough for a moment yours is a story of people a scientist trying to understand life and how it has evolved pilot continues to evolve tell me about some of the characters in your story especially car was\nMm yes so I came across this so early on in my own discovery of this subject Karl Rove and microbiology at the University of Illinois who came out of nowhere and suddenly in November third Nineteen Seventy seven appeared on the front page of the New York times\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nBird kingdom of life on earth the separate form of life that was unknown to exist before that\nBefore that we thought they were basically two kinds of life bacteria and everything else bacteria were simple cells everything else was composed of complex cells with cell nuclei animals plants fun guy humans and wolves came along and said no wait a minute I've discovered a third form\nAnd that was the beginning of a sequence of discoveries that he essentially trigger that have led to this new understanding\nAnd by the way what was it that he discovered was between bacteria and multi cellular organism\nThere was a group of organisms now known as the archaea archaea as in archaeology suggesting old because it was thought that they were the oldest form of life on earth maybe\nThese were creatures that had been taken for bacteria for decades and decades ever since people started looking at microbes through microscopes they thought that these things were bacteria\nWas started sequencing their genomes and lo and behold he said no these things are not bacteria if you look at their genomes and not only distinct from bacteria but they're more similar to us to humans to all animals plants than they are to bacteria\nThey are radically distinct and so he announced in a scientific paper and the press announced in headlines that he had discovered a separate form of life a third major kingdom\nNow by the way about this kingdom the car was discovered these are pretty tough characters are aren't they they're they're they're in hot spots very extreme temperatures that sort of thing\nWell these creatures the archaea at first they seem to live entirely in extreme environments as you said\nUm hot springs in Yellowstone Park thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean highly acidic environment\nMore and more as scientists discovered ways to sequence DNA just out of the wild they have discovered these creatures living a lot of different environments not all of which are extreme but one of the groups of extremity loving our kids\nLive near events at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean almost ten thousand feet down between Norway and Iceland\nAnd those are ... are called low key archaea and it's now thought that they in fact\nAre the descendants of our original ancestors that we all complex creatures grew out of an ancestor that more closely resembled one of those one of these are kids living an event at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean\nThan having come from anywhere else but those are how to put it there are the descendants of our ultimate ancestors that we come from archaea and not from say the bacterial side of the tree of life\nThen raises the question maybe they came from someplace else because if they're really tough ... they might have survived\nInterstellar space you know that's why NASA\nFunded car was his work his original funder when he discovered the archaea one of his funders was the national aeronautics in space administration why\nBecause they thought that his work might shed light on the problem of XO biology the possibility of the existence of life on other planets other star systems other places around the universe\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHe was trained to at Amherst and then at Yale in bio physics that was his PHD and then he went to work for the general electric labs in Schenectady New York\nThey hired him as a research molecular biologist and he really had no idea what they wanted him to be doing he sat in a lab in Schenectady for a few years noodle laying around\nAnd trying to make some important discoveries he was always interested in pure science in the deep questions what is the shape of the early history of life and the history of life since then\nEventually he was hired away to the University of Illinois where he could be a cranky crunch the professor that didn't spend much time with undergraduate he was a terrible lecture\nHe was reclusive you didn't participate in faculty committees he was just this brilliant grouch who could be wonderful to students could be a fine generous mentor but could also be this total reclusive grump\nA complicated man with different sides to and which is part of what attracted me to him as a character is the central character the book the other thing that attracted me it was and\nI quickly saw that he is probably the most important biologist of the twentieth century that nobody has ever heard of\nSo one could say that convergence is a major theme of your book and of course than the Darwinian tradition wear jeans past vertically from parents offspring we draw trees to represent this movements and the limbs on a tree only diverge from other branches the David if the tree of life is not actually a tree\nHow might we best described evolution based on what you've researched and written about here\nWell some people say we should think of a Web and not a tree of life because as you say convergence is very very important a network of life one fellow suggested the circle of life\nAnd yet the tree is still mostly right captured some big patterns\nBut there are exceptions to those patterns the tree image was valuable to Darwin and the people who followed him because it represented the divergence that has occurred\nThrough the history of life one lineage diverging and to lineages one limb into two branches et cetera and species diverge from one another all of this divergence that led to the diversity\nOf life that we see on earth now but it's not just a matter of divergence the discoveries that flowed from from what was his work and his methodology including things like the prevalence of a phenomenon called horizontal gene transfer genes moving sideways across boundaries\nThose represented convergence and so the real history of life is a history of lots and lots of divergence complicated by a lesser but very significant amount of convergence
