the initial near real time warning and then the second is the network of electronic devices essentially\nA cell phones handheld cell phones that enable people in the community to communicate as they evacuated or move to safer ground\nWe had planned to do the deployment this fall September October the Indonesian agency the M cagey was very interested in this proposal you know unfortunately the project is currently on hold until more funding comes in\nSo it's like that everybody agreed that people should wear seatbelts for that wasn't enough money for everyone to have one\nUnfortunately that's exactly the case\nAs I understand that there was a system of booties there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful part of this project um Indonesia supported by the U.S in Germany had twenty two movies\nThat were operating and designed actually to provide a similar data from the ocean floor change in the water pressure in the water column\nBut those buoys actually had been vandalized and we're not functioning and as a matter of fact the Marines survey agency BP T that managed to movies actually cancelled that program\nBecause they were not able to keep them operational so the ... had not been operating since two thousand sixteen\nNow what are the advantages of the system that you've helped to develop over the now defunct system of bullies\nThe major difference is it is anchored to the ocean floor so it cannot be vandalized and it uses a very interesting scientific phenomenon of the thermal kind of warm equatorial waters\nTo enable who's the communication that is underwater communication where the data is transmitted from the sensors to another communication center\nTo another communication sensor and then picked up and

it's a great place to have your toes\nIn the sand is yeah it's uh but I mean it's a it's a gift beyond description and it was wonderful to be able to be there but I think that\nEverywhere on our Cape uh people that get to experience the beauty of our sand dunes are low tides of the enormous beaches or the remarkable vision that President Kennedy had the great the Cape cod seashore national monument so we're we're very lucky people and uh\nOur history goes way back obviously made everybody during the Arab Seventeen hundreds Eighteen hundreds early sixteen hundreds came here on a boat\nAnd we have always had a tie our history to the sea and in our merchant efforts or the China trade the caught on top of the state huh cod wailing a and\nYou know we don't have cod though I mean this ought to be a message to everybody it's Cape Cod that they're no cod\nOr very very few and precious few and it's a it's a tragedy if we don't start paying attention to how we manage these kinds of things we could see an economic impact on our state\nSo what do we need to do today to take care of our I think there are three primary\nChallenges a number one\nClimate change which is caused by greenhouse gases which fall in the ocean and the ... the ocean which has a negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shells and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world\nAre we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate of impact we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic\nImpact and so that's why we all at particular respect and concern\nThe second grade impact is pollution general pollution\nPeople build the bill near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution\nView I've run off the of gasoline runoff from stations you have oil rental if you have pesticide runoff you have high nitrate runoff which affects the level of oxygen and water and therefore the fashion plants a foreigner in the ocean\nAnd we have five hundred dead zones around the world and the ocean's today ... nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload\nAnd also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds I've seen film of a shark send or ... or whales dragging nets around and dragging plastic around it's crazy\nAnd then finally we have over fishing\nWe have too much money chasing too few fish\nAnd that's one of the reasons we don't have any cod anymore here eight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of this sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones and the others or at or near\nMax so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class who now have discovered blue tuna and sushi or with four hundred million Indians likewise and people around the world gaining in income and\nTherefore appetite we have a huge challenge at all\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHuge demand for fishes food stock and increasingly we're going to see pressure on that so those are the Big East but the pollution is just stunning I mean if we continue at the rate we're going there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and twenty Thirty years\nNow of course you've had a storied career most recently as a diplomat and your background I think you spent some time in France and Switzerland as a kid and your dad was a diplomat\nBut when it comes to the ocean you've had some special concerns and I just want to quickly ask you about ... about to\nOne there's something called the law the sea treaty was something that the United states and the folks from Massachusetts like Ellie Richardson worked on years ago which we never ratified and now there's talk of having some sort of a high seas treaty um that would govern what is it half of the world is not in any dress to correct\nIt's called the high seas and the high seas do not belong to any particular nation but they get egregiously overfished by renegade fishers pirate fisherman and years ago Senator Ted Stevens and I went to the United nations to try to ban the drift Annette fishing\nWe succeeded it was banned\nBut today you have pirates fishermen renegade fishermen who go out with addressing that addressed net is literally thousands of miles a model filament netting that they dropped behind the boat dragged along it kinda strip mines the ocean and as much as two thirds of the catch\nCertainly fifty percent is called waste cash they just throw it overboard so it's changing the ecology of the ocean by imagine the division of a UC a strip mined coal or in the land you see it just ravaging everything around that this is what address that will do\nAnd then sometimes it breaks off and it becomes what we call the ghost in it because it just fishes on its own mind it's weighted down with carcasses it sinks to the bottom scavengers clean it off it rises to the topic and an till it gets tangled in a whale or tangled in the propellers of some boat\nIt's a scourge and we have no enforcement on those high seas or very little enforcement I should say occasionally someone's military ship goes through it and you can check on who's who and what's happening and you can certainly mark what chips or their fishing\nSo we're over fishing talked to me about the climate and your concerns about climate change\nWe face a massive challenge of dealing with climate refugees the prime minister of the Fiji Islands\nI I just met with him the other day or an event in California where he pointed out that they're literally taking refugees from other islands and they themselves are now planning how to move where can they go to be safe\nThey'll lose their nation state which is these islands increased fires increased floods more moisture in
