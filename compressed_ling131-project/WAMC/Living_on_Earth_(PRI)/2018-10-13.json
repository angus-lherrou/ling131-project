is yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientists with the inner governmental panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael with only seemingly small increases in the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty Fifteen Paris climate agreement calls for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees would be beneficial but this new report finds that half degree difference poses huge risks\nKeeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal is going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer professor Oppenheimer has been a lead author for high PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back living on earth Michael\nGlad to be here again I'll be cut to the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the eyepiece you see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and uh if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering message upon reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here\nThey are projected to worsen over time and the point at which the risks are related to climate change that is that the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not\nToward the end of this century but very close a matter of a decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nWhat's the basic premise of this report

very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next these are called special reports that I'm working on the next special report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets\nThe report that just came out is on the question of what is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a dangerous zone where the risks are just so high\nThat we may just as a member of society is not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at a single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest IPC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reaching net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there\nAnd I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people in the report than frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has\nHas put on it is sort of like twelve years of we don't do we should do the world comes to an end that's not the case reality is at every step you do the best you can and if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to an end costs as the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually\nThat doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands states but it'll make life just miserable expensive and uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of limiting warming to a degree and a half centigrade\nContrary to what most people think of the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological\nThe costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they never going to be entirely negligible but\nThe real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organized to actually reinvent themselves to be not independent of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what impact do we need to do then as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nThe most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means\nGetting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible reducing end eventually eliminating our dependence on\nPetroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and probably the biggest\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no poll Daoud ... invented to make a lot easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog hunt S. dot com\nYou to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards mid century\nIt seems we go in and need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was called for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of\nScientists were skeptical that there would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half and two degrees but because the government's call for the report a lot of scientists went out\nAnd started doing research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nAnd flooding that they were big differences between one and a half and two degrees I mean give me an example already by one and a half degrees\nThere are places are particularly islands in the Pacific and megacities all around the world for which the incidence of the benchmark hundred year storm or a hundred year flood event I should call it\nRun right into one or the other lady didn't the night the jacko goes on barking and barking\nPark says lenders living on

moment looking at American history in Eighteen sixty\nIn the south there was more monetary value in slaves than there was in the last uh Eighteen sixty five that was a classic stranded at all that value disappeared\nTo what extent today do you think we're being held hostage by folks who think that all that fossil fuel and the ground which is on balance sheets at billions and billions and billions of dollars\nAnd it can't all be burned if we understand the science correctly\nTo what extent are we headed down a path I mean to solve the problem we had with slavery I mean there's a moral question there just like we have today with climate as well as the economic question to solve that problem we wound up in a pretty in a very bloody war\nI Do I mean I don't think that's the choice for for America now I think that I think uh most of the executives I Know at the higher level of the oil industry or old diversifying\nA Shelby pay their all investing in New energy they're ready to move

just the nature of the beast we've got to try to guarantee is not for to allowing\nWhy I'm simply listening to the scientists I mean I'm listening to the un and understanding the science if we don't
