Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learned more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages\nOn Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help and has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all\nLogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election started poking around ten is a State University Center for election systems\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com I did a\nVery very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election documents all dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations and this\nThis particular search didn't turn that up instead I found it very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a voter named in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought while that that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor password to be used on election day\nThere were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully\nPut on the Web server in total\nLamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of it lamb also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security\nNumber and their driver's license number\n... and there were also gyms databases and the gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza that\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be an attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic pull books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise that Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen to seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched\nThen more information started to trickle out [noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked\nAbout Russian cyber attacks election systems and the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment\nStreaming support for WAMC come from ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast

this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts\nSusan green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia are computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely has machine that don't have a paper ballot\nThen there's also other machines which count paper about those are all the computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here at the races here's how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of remove open media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep bunks that assertion which is that many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and the cellular networks are part of the Internet\n[noise]\n[noise] we spent a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio and North Carolina and Georgia\nThat purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data\nBase [noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen\nStreaming support for WAMC come from ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nGames weren't on the voter rolls are they in Durham county they use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you're at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nAnother way\nThrough a loan them see\nMm gonna miss the snow
