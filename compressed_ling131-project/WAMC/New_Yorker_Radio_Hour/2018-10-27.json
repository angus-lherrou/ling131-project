Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter Eliza Griswold is been spending a lot of time falling races in the state of Pennsylvania\nAnd what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes to a lot of people's backyards and they're really unhappy about it\nOne of the communities allies

Danielle let's going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five\nAnd she works in marketing have you heard about running for office Danielle excused orange would you do okay well I actually live right on top and drive [noise] and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of a controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within five fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fears to now with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impacts heavier fears about an impact your life um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and it was a snow cone pipeline that was only a week old and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in her bed [noise] and um [noise] I called him and I said John we have to move like have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless strayed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national\nPolitics just an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory roll back and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to me it just wasn't something\nLike maybe\nI thought it would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things\nWe've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us\n[noise] it's it's

and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she listed her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wealth and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics in both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking is made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America\nAnd\nAnd that's brought in a lot of different players including to know go and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety is our top priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design on pipeline to follow the safest wrong with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP as a private corporation that they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline move natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east to market
