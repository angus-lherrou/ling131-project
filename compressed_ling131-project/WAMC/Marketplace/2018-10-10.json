[noise]\nAbout you are because well actually they might and not just because many races are so tied political parties can't afford to ignore younger voters but because this time around\nMany young voters refused to be ignored\n[noise] both of them out the rallying cry from the march for our lives following the Parkland\nShooting youth registration spiked after the protests and those young voters mean business in a new poll by a deep breath\nThe center for information to end research on civic learning and engagement thirty four percent of Eighteen to twenty four year old said they are extremely likely to vote in the mid term some of that energy is a response to the political environment but there's also money behind it mostly from the left\nOur program is over thirty million dollars in a good chunk of that is being spent on field organizing on the ground face to face conversations with young people\nThan whistles with progressive group next Gen America he says his outreach budget this year is more than double what it was in twenty four teen outreach aimed at people like the friends of Twenty one year old scholar Reinhardt who lives in northern Virginia Reinhart is registered to vote but many of his friends\nAren't I just don't think they're that engage in the political sphere honestly a lot of my grinding pretty hard right now at jobs out of school\nEven so next Gen says it's already signed up more than two hundred and thirty thousand young voters across the political spectrum Mike do have is a Republican strategist with the public affairs from mercury\nI think you're seeing a new registrations for both parties at a higher clip that I've seen in the mid term in a long time\nHe says the GOP hope to pull in younger voters along with everyone else but some campaigns are also focusing on places like college campuses and high schools\nThere's no one size fits all but you do see a whether it's activities a level of as her fares mailings to voters who just turned\nEighteen next Gen Z Wessel says the increased attention and funding is a recognition that the old strategy wasn't working\nSaying look our job needs to be to register motivate and turnout younger people rather than choose the same people who live in like six counties in central Ohio\nBut registration is one thing election day is another and the real test will come when it's time to show up and vote in Washington I'm Kimberly Adams for marketplace [noise]\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for

kids who are or a market their market that can be catered to the content can be created for and from which profit can be made\nThe corporate example at hand is YouTube and its influence on the youngest of consumers Alexis Madrigal is a staff writer for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by YouTube book on the program thanks for having show talked to me about how you came to work on this story\nI have a two year old and a five year old vaccine toddler YouTube and I was like what are all these things all these brands I'd never heard of\nThese companies all over the world and I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed in this kind of animation that to me it looks kind of pre Pixar if you know what I mean\nHuh okay there are lots to unpack in there because the idea first of all of a toddler you to what what is that is it as it sounds\nSo Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know when you're old two year old three year old ... and that's what I call tons of YouTube and it's this kind of wild place\nWell [laughter] I I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them off almost as much as adults that kind of seems\nTo mean YouTube is by far the most popular brand among children and even little children have their own favorites for one of the biggest brands within the space is called choo choo TV you know they have Nineteen billion view is they have twenty nine million subscribers\nThis is a global children's entertainment ... kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back with the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street in children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all of that was to educate not necessarily want a two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that the mission of of toddler YouTube an end to chew TV is that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they've banned entertainment they bend to trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can\nAnd now they realized that they've done that and they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producers on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube it's good for kids rather than just something that sets up their time\nWell so spit bullet for me do you think that's gonna work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube's doing\nNot really on the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business there's obviously a much different\nAnd the biggest difference is there's just YouTube basically this is an issue where kids are going this is where the whole businesses and so YouTube itself would have to be the one that sort of maybe tip the scales for educational content within the algorithms that determine what people watch what do we know what do we think uh it's actually doing it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOnes that are screens does to grownups what about the kids young kids\nWell I think you know the the worst possible impact is that essentially that kind of attention grabbing fast paced content and the ability to switch between those things very quickly maybe sending kids up to back to kind of pacing that's actually not educational\nAnd that's kind of the big worry that we sort of in juice kind of attention a loss and kids\nAlexis ... writes for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by you to watch what really pushing [noise]\n\n\n\nComing up a huge part of the music industry is
