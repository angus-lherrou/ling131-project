{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "That moving were thousand dollars of a million dollar goal that's nothing at the drop in the bucket we could end it tonight\nIf we've gotten this far in two days so far minus\nTwo and a half hours that we have here at the Knight crew [noise] there's there's no telling I mean we absolutely could all it takes us calls I Know there's enough people listening right now to close it up immediately and there's enough people here waiting to take your pledge that we can handle that\nSo if you want to wrap up this fun driving you want to get back to normal programming give us a call right now it's more important than ever we want to be back to normal tomorrow morning wanting a hundred and three two three nine to six to\nUh you know we all want to get back to our normal jobs not just because we like that and normalcy but also because frankly in sitting here pitching on the fund drive is not what we're here to do this is\nImportant from time to time it's a a it's a mechanical thing that we have to do to keep the station running but we're here\nBecause we think that the station is important and because we want to uh you know keep doing the job that we find important everyday [noise]\nUh we want to provide that excellent coverage award winning coverage and content we want to be able to be accessed by the airwaves for years and years and years to come as well as on line and all those things have costs\nAnd uh you know three times a year we interrupt broadcast to come to you ask you to help us finance that\nAnd that's it and then the rest of the time like you said he and uh we are elsewhere\nWhere and when the thing if you want to listen to all that great election coverage coming up\nMaker pledge now and that way when you listen a month from now you'll say this this is what I paid for when you listen in the holiday season if you like the special programming that that you know you rely on if you want to listen to Alice restaurant you know that's if that's important to you\nMake a pledge you'll know that's what you paid for it it's funny\nBecause I was just in a conversation not long ago about our Thanksgiving coverage plans mhm um one thing you might not realize if you don't listen on holidays is that we do have MORNING EDITION northeast report midday magazine\nThree hundred and sixty five days a year\nAnd a so this Thanksgiving um I was just in a in a short meeting about you know making sure we have the right Alex is version what time of that era are we going to get to the weather at twelve twenty four when Allen says is done and fit to mid day in there\nAnd ah yeah we're thinking about these things all the time we're trying to give you the information you care about on the air and online\nAnd that's where your pledge goes do it also goes through national shows that are not cheap to carry I'm In these meetings I Know I Know what our ... our bill is I Know how much it costs for us to take shows like fresh air and market place and so on and if you love what you hear on WAMC please do not take it for granted that's what the fund drives for\nIf you can do five bucks to support it if that's all you can do that's fine with us if you can do five hundred\nSee please do not take it for granted that's what the fund drives for if you can do five bucks to support it if that's all you can do that fine with us if you can do five hundred that it's also fine but trust me uh it's not just a radio station it's an entire infrastructure it's a lot of humans who come to work and work hard\nUh it is technological things that I don't again to understand towers and I I barely get how radio is broadcast but I I Know what news is and uh\nThat's what you're helping to keep on the air when you make a pledge just like Patrick go Riley insured New Yorker did it for the night crew awesome and anonymous and connected ... says looking forward to having programming back I miss it great thank you so much one eight hundred three two three Ninety six through I guess my point is\nIf you're getting your car and your kitchen or your alarm clock and it just set to Ninety point three of them and it comes in and you hear the world through there that will not always be there if you don't make sure it is\nRight we all want to be here but there are costs you know first of all for the most part with the amount of work that we do I mean it's amazing that the station is able to exist would be a small relatively small number of people who come together and make it happen because everybody here worked so hard\nAnd even if that was the case that you know we were all independently wealthy and couldn't afford to volunteer our time here and work on the products that are also committed to with no need their ex journal cost there are a lot of things that need to be paid for 'em we try to do it as ... with as little as possible\nAnd ah that's why we're able to uh interrupt you're listening so frequently so infrequently writer we oh we can be a three time of year I slept they're all we do\nWell you know what when you are sitting in his chair in sometimes night too feels like night eight but you know what\nIf we can interrupt if if we can end this tonight if we knew that every time we have a fun driving yeah interrupt you for six nights six six days a year to finance this entire station\nThat's incredible to me for the good yeah and uh that just is a testament to how much listeners appreciate the station what station me into the community and if you believe in that and you think that that patients should be here that the station is important and you have a voice that yet\nAnd that was a great time one eight hundred three two three nine to six to have you ... if you're one of those people who sits on the fans who says [noise]\nYou know every time to fund drive cars around I think about giving and I'm like\nI'll do it next time somebody else will get it don't do it next time because it's not going to end without hearing from you we need to get a everything that we need to wrap up this goal so that we can get off the air in and get regular content\nOn and you don't want to be the one friend who never picked up the check right a brunch if you can afford to help support the station we employer you too and and the reason is there are people who can't end this station is available whether you can or whether you can't we're happy to be here for that but if you can afford to support the station\nYou know that goes a lot farther than you\nOne eight hundred three two three nine to six to is the number or online at WAMC dot org I'm Sorry I liked the brunch metaphor this WAMC is one big brunch is a really big table on a different choices a lot of different
