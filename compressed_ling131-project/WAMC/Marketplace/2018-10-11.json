chemicals drummer right [laughter] or even worse Jimmy Fallon gets your Jimmy Kimmel yeah because\nI think I'm a first there's a little if there was you off a little bit you know people have history like I just didn't pop up you know out of out of nowhere but I'm dealing with it\nDo you ever look around and say I'm skid from Philadelphia man what am I doing it\nMore [noise] more or less a it how did I get here often when I go back to Philadelphia I'd do something called chasing ghosts\nAre still in my first car and I keep it I'm Sorry you still have your first car accident and I still utilize it yeah and I go to my mom's house and I get it and usually I drive around when I go to Philly I'll drive from like midnight to three in the morning literally just chasing ghosts and\nThe thing I always do is when I go past\nThe place where the roots used to a mosque on um fifth in South street that I'm always like yellow like back in Nineteen Ninety two I thought Nineteen Ninety nine was going to be the future you know let alone\nWhat I still be a thing in two thousand Eighteen I mean I'm not one of those knock on wood people that I don't want to jinx it but as he knocks on what I as I as I did it you know ... but I I just I'm Amazed that no one's kicked me out the pool yet yeah we\nWe had um we had ... on the program ... about two weeks ago and we had a whole thing about she got limited what radical during you know and she's doing really well and I said how are you made now and she said oh honey you're never made\nUm yeah even you know this is our our technically are twenty some professional year as a group\nAnd I I still work as if this could all end tomorrow that's why people ask like well you do so many things you have a Nineteen jobs like when did you get the relax and\nJust do in my mind that it's always this could end tomorrow so don't ever sleep you know it does it ever surprise you that\nYou have become that guy now to people turn to for advice and mentorship and\nI'm I'm very uncomfortable with that even my Twitter handle says like I'm I'm Better as a student not a teacher like this whole course love is said scholar at ... earlier I your bunch of rappers called me like oh gee [laughter] I don't know I I\nI kind of shrug it that ... would you\nBe here without the Tonight Show I mean you you have said that you looked at that and I drove a gig as a as a way to sort of fade into the sunset\nI'm I'm resilient so I Would like to think that I've always been something but I Would be a fool if I didn't tell you that the Tonight Show opened up even way more doors than I expected like I I truly thought this was going to be the most gentle mercy killing ever\nKnow as I should I [laughter] I'm just glad I'm not all of them does not one that I think like oh this could benefit you\nKnow because I was reading on the op eds and even though I Love being underestimated huh someone someone had a road in a I'm In a block once like\nLike oh this is a sad day for music because watching the roots except this uh Tonight Show gig will be like watching Miles Davis bus going to New York ... man and\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nNo I Love being underestimated huh someone someone had a wrote in a I'm In a block once like\nLike oh this is a sad day for music because watching the roots\nExcept the Tonight Show gig will be like watching Miles Davis bus getting a New York's ... man and I was actually like good luck with what I Want I Want to be underestimated 'cause I Want it to I Want it to to kill all a\nPerceptions of this being a square gig yeah do do you buy the sort of the the conventional wisdom that you've changed late that music [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media\nHad just started to become a thing something like ... the idea of viral videos was becoming a thing\nAnd we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block and it was clear like Letterman wasn't going to start being on Snapchat and\nThat sort of thing so we just took advantage of and then the playing field you know a lot of late night shows were just post jazz music there there were other avenues to explore and we took full advantage of it it\nIt's interesting because there was a lineage right there's ... percent from the old Tonight Show and then there's Paul Shaffer probably the next notable guy in an interview and the roots\nThat's where it and you know again like I didn't you know I didn't have posters of ... and said I Want to like one day that will be me is just making them most of it again like in two thousand eight when he proposed it to us or\nWe should say you you didn't take the call for a long time yeah I was like a man we just got to to a place where we were making good money on the road like why will return\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably or was that our domestic personal lives huh kids were getting older crime more at the airport\nSo it was sort of like we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there's a way that we could Celine Dion our way\nInto a position that I like to use all this stuff is ... Celine Dion our way into a position where we could still make a good living without having to have a ... for him and be on the bus for nine hours and\nThat sort and men just fell into our lap and I was like\nBe careful what you asked for there's a ... this is going to get old marketplace in and you know ... management on your hair but I live for that stuff well well good and in fact that's the really the question right because you have said more than a couple of points\nPlanning something is the joy of actually doing that something and the question of the out of the question that comes out of it is what's it like to work for you how do you run the ban how you run the ... how do you run you guys on the show\nUm you know there's there's lessons to learn about it because again where we're at a phase in our lives where we're not twenty two twenty three like that here was forty five now yeah off with a look at Fort Lee ... inside of it [noise]\nUm so the things that I Would like to do like you know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a row and that sort of thing and we used to do [noise]\nYou know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that sort of thing\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nOr what forty five now yeah I was looking for at least ... I'm Sorry I'm so the things that I Would like to do like you know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a room at sort of thing and we used to do\nYou know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that sort of thing not to mention a lot of our side projects\nWell it's weird because one the roots is just one of Nineteen things I'm responsible for we're in a very sweet spot right now where we're actually having more fun with each other\nSocially which is great that we've ever had I realize that we're going to fall apart if\nAs people we weren't having form with each other you know what I mean so I think now that we're in as as a unit\n[noise] this is the best it's ever been we're going to enter either veteran coming to figuring wasn't appreciated [noise]\n\n\nIf you're not one of the very large players you better be offering some products\nTrue in life true also in retirement planning but first sure what the student\nDays in a row the wall was I don't know about this down ... five forty five to ten percent twenty five thousand dollar fifty to ... Ninety two point one point two percent Seventy three and twenty nine [noise]\nJust the five hundred dollar fifty seven percent twenty seven twenty age their banks did along with bond yields Wells Fargo drop one point eight percent Citigroup give back to enter just present bank of America declined three percent they energy stocks tagged as oil prices hit a two week low Exxon Mobil", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Marketplace", "city": "Albany", "day": "11"}
