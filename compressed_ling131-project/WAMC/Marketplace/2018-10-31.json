{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WAMC", "content": "The real cost to both campaigns goes into figuring out where to place those at Yale University political science professor Alex ... recently published a study on the effectiveness of ads in Spanish\nThe major cost and this is why I think we don't see more kinds of doing it is if you hit a monolingual English only person with\nA Spanish version they react extremely negatively\nHe says it could be that English only speakers tend to ... banished because they want the candidates to appeal to their own culture ... says the main problem campaigns have is that the data on who speak Spanish in a community isn't specific enough\nYou know this might be the sort of thing that works better when you can target at the individual level like online advertisements\nYou're online behavior which you search for and what you read to tell the politician more about what language do you prefer than yours if ... does which means the future of Spanish political ads could be more targeted to your Facebook feed than what's on your TV [noise] in Austin, Texas ... for marketplace [noise]\nOf all the time to start a new job running one of the biggest financial companies in this economy one would imagine that October two thousand eight would be just about the worst but sometimes you got to play the Andrew Dell right so ... did taking over a CEO and president of Charles Schwab from Charles Schwab himself ten years ago this month\nAnd to hear him tell it which we will he's actually had a pretty good decade well that and You're welcome to the program sir\nThanks a lot ... it's great to have the opportunity to spend time together\nOr as I noted or in the in the introduction you've been at this company ten years which means uh you took over ten years ago in the middle of the worst financial crisis this country's seen in a generation or more was what were those days like for a financial services company guy\nYou know at that point in time there was very little that you could do to the outcome that your company would experience as a result of that crisis was more\nThe result of the decision you made prior to when you were deep in the middle of that crisis so are you going into work every day just kind of hanging on for the ride [laughter]\nNo it wasn't quite like that I think uh I think in my first Ninety Days is CEO I was a successful and having the stock price there probably are and who does that have made it a decade who are able to achieve that\nYeah um what is it or was it I suppose uh about financial services that they got you're going I mean you've found your first financial services you're on financial services company when you were like twenty what two or three or something\nTwenty two actually my uh my formal training was as a pension actuary so I I provided consulting services eventually that business evolved to where we needed a link between our computer systems\nIt's an actuary so I I provided consulting services eventually that business evolved to where we needed a link between our computer systems and where the money we're sided and we linked up with Schwab and over a few years we became Schwab largest client and then Schwab acquired my farm a few years after that\nYou know your boss Charles Schwab who is still the German the board in and are active in the company as I understand it also by the way like the second or third CEO I did in this series lo these many years ago but but anyway\nUm yeah I'm a ... he and ... and you will ... originated the concept really at scale of discount retailer brokerage and I wonder if you look around and see that everybody's catching up to you 'cause fees are going down and and all of those things are happening that have to affect your business\nWell I don't think there's any organization that's generating the net new assets lows that we are the new households lows that we are the new account so so I don't I don't know that I Would go so far as people are catching up to us but more people understanding that\nIt is important to not only deliver quality service and quality advice to investors but also do so at a value that leaves more money in their pocket that's a good thing\nYou know we're we're a large institution three and a half trillion dollars we're focused on building an organization and rewarding our stock holders communities employees but but ultimately it all originates with whether we're doing the right thing by our clients and I'm a whole lot more proud of the fact that we also generate less revenue per dollar\nOn every a client asset than anyone else a size so\nDoes your mind when he was really or no you feel that way generating less revenue come on\nAbsolute less revenue per dollar because what it ultimately means chi's relieving more money in the pocket of the investor and and and it was her money to begin with I mean our job is about helping them get outcomes that makes sense\nAnd to the extent we do that do reward us with more business I think that's a whole lot better way to grow then to try to extract maximum revenue from every client and an ultimately I Would say\nThat chocolate view that is maybe one of the most important legacies of his pounding this company over four decades ago how often do you talk to him every day I just left his office about five minutes before I Hope the headset\nOn burn up show if business is good uh what do you worry about as a guy who as you said managers three and something trillion dollars worth of other people's money well certainly\nThe cyber ah environment is significant risk for for all of us um you know you're talking about thousands of the Thames every single day to try to access clients' accounts or access systems and and of
