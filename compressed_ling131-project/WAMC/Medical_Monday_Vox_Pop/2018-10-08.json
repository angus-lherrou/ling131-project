[noise]\nThat's a really good question um it currently has not been found to be effective to screen the whole population has incidents of ... is quite low and so generally it's felt that the risk of screening the population is not worth it but that may change as the technology continues to improve\nSo is there are a genetic a history here in other words if your parents headed or do you have a better chance of getting it\nSo that's a really good question um as I got yes some questions some ... are felt to be genetic\nBut that is the uh\nThe exception rather than the rule most ah patients who have an ... either ruptured her on ruptured you not have a family history the only risk factor that we know for ... information and enters I'm ruptured smoking\nBut we do see plenty of patients who have enters who've never smoked before where there are other and you always wonder what is the smoke do we don't really know other than the fact that somehow it weakens the blood vessel wall or more than normal and those ... are more likely to rupture okay\nWe're off to David in Canaan All right David and can in your own\nAs for lawyers or any relationship between the build up a plaque or

open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nSo narrowing of either the karate or do the cerebral orders\nHi David yes uh absolutely and that's one of the things I really want to stress today is that the majority of strokes are preventable and their preventable by the same things that help prevent coronary artery disease which are I exercise healthy diet [noise]\nTreatment of diabetes those things that can help prevent coronary artery disease can also help prevent carotid artery disease\nWhich is out of the same effect a ... for the cerebral arteries says they do on the coronary arteries\nYes absolutely as well as aspirin or ... makes a lot okay\nI just read a study that came out and said that the ... the eighty one milligram aspirin was now somebody in doubt I've taken one all my life so we know about that\nSo that's any looked at patients who have no history of ah\nAny heart disease and so I think certainly most doctors would continue to recommend it daily aspirin for patients who had a history of heart disease or history of stroke\nThat that's any specifically looked at patients who have no other risk factors and found that the risks were higher than the benefits um and the risk is bleeding rescues bleeding usually GI bleeding ulcers learn so I think a larger studies still needs to be done but it did question what we generally think is a safe medication for patients who have no risk factors\nRight they always pull the rug out from under me I like that okay so it's a one eight hundred three for eight to five by one one eight hundred three for eight to five five one we'll go to Maurice in Bennington Hi Maurice\nWell good afternoon folks stuck to a sharp drop one of my heroes I fell on your\nList and thanks for taking my call I've been living with Vin abdominal and orders for about ten years [noise] and Dr I noticed snuff theory of your expertise but I can probably answer

rigid out by\nOkay and now on to the gym in mechanic bill or given mechanical you're on\nIts me [noise] um you were speaking just a few minutes ago about a screening for ... we were out there um [noise] they haven't yet been shown to be a there hasn't yet been shown to be a great need for that um\nHowever I you're probably aware of this there's there's a company that does screenings are called lifeline screenings yeah\nAnd I have had a had gone through their screening I just went through a back in June and one of the things that they actually do is for\nIs abdominal I'm ... I'm Sorry I just wonder if you could speak to the value of of um\nYou know that type of thing because it isn't covered by insurance and um but you know their their whole shtick is to uh you know do screenings for for things that are have health impacts but that are are not necessarily covered by insurance\nOkay here we go to Jim thank you for that question go ahead Dr\nSo sure I'm\nScreening for abdominal a near them and certainly easier because it's just an ultrasound test which is certainly more affordable I'm so that is something that I think is becoming more popular but the MRI a or the seats yeah that would be required to screen for ... is much more expensive\nAnd the CPA does carry a small risk of radiation as well I the contracts administration and so I think until we're able to have a better technology I we are working on ultrasounds for the brain which may be some day would be able to screen for ... um I think it's so then I remain in question\nDeport comes from the ... program at Adirondack health ... lake offering weight loss surgery and lifestyle education better health better lives Adirondack health dot org the pride center of the capital region honoring el ... community leaders\nThe two thousand Eighteen pride center gala friday October nineteenth at the Albany capitals center capital pride center dot org Adirondack oral surgery Albany ... glands falls offering a range of coral and Maximo facial surgery including with them the extraction dental implant oral pathology and more\nAdirondack oral surgery dot com mount Carmel care center in Lenox, Massachusetts offering a full range of care services including long term short term rehabilitation and respite care\nMount Carmel care dot org and from the ... foundation for hunks of New York honoring founder Jimmy ... continuing his work for over four decades and for generations helping the chemical dependent and their families battle addiction ... got or for inquiry [noise]\nAnd we are back crews are wonderful guests are Dr Alexandra poll of all the medical center who is here to discuss cerebral vascular health uh and we're getting a lot of colds or will try to get to everybody now All right let's go to a yeah bomb\nIn a car rental cars and gone above\nDoctor hello Bob ... a good question I burn\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot EDU\nHas cerebral vascular health uh and we're getting a lot of calls it a little further you get to everybody now All right let's go to a yeah bomb in a car rental cars and love your\nDoctor hello Bob\nOkay good question I asked for my monitor was Seventy five years old and had a stroke\nA bleeding stroke but for many many years the treasury arts writer St George ... almost every or our you know ... Jim medical school and I mentioned that she had a stroke\nAnd she he said well that can be an hereditary now what would it be more likely to have to be we're all we ask for drugs\nOr is it something I should be concerned about\nSo generally bleeding kinds of strokes which are not related to ... which I assume hers wasn't because there was no mention of an ...\nHas to do with high blood pressure and so while the aspirin could have potentially made the bleeding worse the stroke itself was likely caused by high blood pressure so if you have normal blood pressure and she did not\nHave any ... I don't think there's anything you need to be screened for\nAltered shoulder shame based strictly on thing spring caused her stroke correct correct\nRegular Bob All right now we're going to go over to June in gangs then or on June in king's then you're on\nHigh doctors I just had a question I was wearing I suffer from migraines and I wanted to know I take similar trip ten for it and it's um I as far as I Know it's a visual constructor and I wanted to know does that put you at higher risk crush stroke\n[noise] how'd you so much work and has done related to some\nCases of stroke a so I think if it is helping you their migraines it certainly find to continue but it is something that could be aware of and to try to reduce any other risk factors that you have for stroke so to continue to exercise and to eat a healthy diet and to not smoke\nUm and to just be aware that there is some small association between the trip tents and smoking and stroke\nOh okay great and should I Do regular screening is that something that you would do\nSo it wouldn't be for ... um it would be for stroke and there's really no screening that you could do to them I can with stroke\nOkay June thank you I'm so sorry I didn't mean to cut you off let's go to Eleanor in Linux or right Eleanor Linux go\nHello this is not so nice to talk with you both doctors um I had a rupture of bay and you're done in

cause and your wrists and\nYeah I think that's certainly possible no one has ever been able to study that but there's no reason why you know we've seen secondhand smoke causes a lot of other systemic diseases and so I think there's no reason why it could also not be partially responsible for uh problems with the ... as well so Eleanor did you spend a lot of time around a smoker and run and

responsible for uh problems with the ... as well join or did you spend a lot of time around a smoker and run and gun\nYeah sun ... way a very heavy smoker that um yeah my husband was a very heavy smoker and I uh also had had any exposure to the car we knock cyanide poisoning a traps about three or four years previous to that\nAs well with my entire family\nOh wow [noise] well I'm Glad you recover after a while okay\nEleanor thank you for your call All right now we're going to go to a Donna in Malta or I Don in Malta your own\n[noise] Oh hi thank you for taking my call I have a question in regards to my husband had a stroke three years ago in the hippocampus area of his brain and they had a very hard time finding it and he suffered from global amnesia for forty eight hours and then\nRecover and he's had a um follow up with neurology and\nCardiologists to had a ruled\nOut a trail said and any other causes for the stroke like high blood pressure so but he's getting forgetful again and I'm Wondering how\nCould that have damage that part of this spraying or should we be doing some other cast is there's surgery for that part of the brain just any ideas that would help me direct uh the care that um he might need at this time\nYou feel like he's progressively getting worse\nI feel like his memory he's starting to have um memory loss and [noise] it it's it's sort of reminds me of the same episodes he had right when he was\nGoing through this you know I mean it's kind of like the same questions you cant remember certain thing and this guy\nIs not pro fuse but it's everyday little things and I also know that Alzheimer's I guess hits the hippocampus\nRight actually first I think I'm not real it could be a number of things and buyers Donald laundering gonna look for the dock have a chance to go and dock\nOkay it sounds like it would be reasonable to get a new emmer eye of the brain and if he did have any areas of new stroke to get some imaging ups the blood vessels and that's where a potential surgery could come into place if there's any narrowing of the blood vessels that is putting him at risk for stroke then we could possibly do a procedure to try to balloon open those blood vessels\nOkay Donna okay so what do you see a neurologist for that\nSo I think seeing his neurologist to start would be a good place to start to get the MRI and then they could pay for it to an early version if needed\nHow you guys getting along these days is the neurosurgeons and am very well better again in front of me\n[laughter] well that that helps tremendous All right good luck Donna and I thought\nYeah thank you okay ah I remember the neurosurgeon used to say the rap on the on the other guys were you know diagnosing adios a [laughter] I think everybody's game yet are you that's good uh\nAnd now we're to Peter in Bennington bitter and venting their anger on\nHigh alert world you're okay you're very painful for um\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu and yet or\nYeah that's good uh and now we're to Peter in ... and ... and you're on\nHigh alert okay and\nUgly taking pay your taxes you know we're very painful or I'm I've been told I could have surgery to put in between the blood vessels sure does but of course he scares me want to know about the surgery I'm\nSure I'm where are you listening earlier when the a guy called in who previously had a micro Mackler decompression [noise] what's that mean if\nSomeone had previously called in who had a micro vascular decompression I didn't know if you are listening then but it is a surgery that I'm very familiar with\nUm it's a surgery where we remove part of the school and we pull aside the cerebellum or the bottom part of the brain and we find the blood vessel that is impinging on the nerve and we him in a small piece of caught in between the nerve in the blood vessel\nAnd that's a that's a great success rates are usually very good and so for patients who are having to build hating pain which is keeping them from eating or from kind of living their daily life we generally recommend that they undergo this surgery [noise]\nThere are some risks there's risk you have a fish a weakness was rescued have spinal fluid leaker infection but these risks are generally small and patients are usually quite satisfied with the outcome after the surge\nAnd what happens to that piece of the of the of the school that you've taken away\nSo we usually in this part of the brain which is the back part of the brain we usually cover it with a piece of a piece of match and some cement\nWow okay Peter thank you very much All right now\nOver into
