I guess I Would agree that evolutionary speaking if if that is how we look at the vitamin K that that that could be true but what we found is is that really again it is something that is\nI I I hesitate to call it treatable preventable by giving an interim muscular injection of vitamin K\nUh other complications for babies born in the early side have to do a lot with just sort of progression of nutrition and risk for infection so those are babies who [noise]\nUm we'll get a combination of IV fluids um along with the meetings and then gradually again all feelings and more and more hospitals are recognizing the importance of mother's own milk and not just mothers or milk but also donor breast milk to again\nHelp those most premature babies again rooster reduced their risk of feeding complications\nBut a very early pre me will not know how to do feed\nCorrect so those are babies who actually receive id fluids and then receive\nYou know he's a doctor he's going to get paid to take a break eight hundred three for eight to five five one Dr Phillip ... is our guest they're always on call you know eight hundred three for eight to five five one we'll be right back [noise]\n\nSupport comes from the tank teaching museum of art gallery at Skidmore College providing exhibits public events and educational programs for audiences in the capital district and beyond Skidmore dot edu slash tang\nAdirondack oral surgery serving the capital region and beyond\nAccepting most commercial and managed care insurance plans offering a range of oil and Maxwell facial surgery Adirondack oral surgery dot com beach medical services Queens New York working to increase access to diabetes care weight management and primary care beach medical services dot com\nNathan lick our hospital lovers they'll New York less than fifty minutes from Albany offering minimally invasive procedures for back pain\nWith Dr ... and Dr ... and ...

Adams\nSubject cutting crying babies so many different theories lead in such cry pick them up don't pick them up please ask the doctor to talk about infant crying on what to do\nAll right man it's you're nickel go ahead [noise]\nWell when babies cry it's\nIn the NICU it's actually a lot easier my baby it's don't cry as much but when baby is actually a are at home and there's there's a challenge for parents uh I don't think that there's a simple answer for whether or not to let a baby cry or\nTo leave him alone because again it's important for you to obviously look into the various things that might cause a baby make a baby cry okay\nAll right well that's a good politically correct answer well done then why do babies cry when they first hit the world that's my question well\nThat's just the shock of the cold I think that the changes to in environment it actually is for the for us we're really happy to see actually a baby cry 'cause it'll actually opening the airway actually starting that whole circulation oxygen transfer all those important parts that make for healthy baby my baby is allowed\nAnd they're still allowed to this day or this one is from Joe I'm Wondering about newborns being addicted to nicotine from smoking mother seems logical could be part of the cranky ... baby story and that is from Joe\nWell nicotine has been shown or at least smoking has been shown to a a put a baby at risk again for being a smaller a lower birth weight compared to the ... to a baby again who's been annexed posed\nA in it as for whether or not they are addicted no these are babies who are addicted to the nicotine or but we do find that some babies again who are exposed to more smoking might again be a little bit more jittery ... or so again not exactly withdrawal but certainly again they met her symptoms again I've ... is\nOur guest today is Dr phil a pan and back to the phones we go at eight hundred three for eight to five five one Julian Middletown you've been very patient Iran\nThank you my question is diabetic lifestyle an anti Nazi and signed a ten day also taking farming and they want to know that continued um after the chef Michel ... taking the filing

things that again moms are treated with\nA for diabetes um met foreign not necessarily through the pregnancy if I recall but again that's something that uh is more of an optical question rather than\nA a newborn questions or neonatal medicine question ah as for the the potential effect on babies are babies again Ken at first have problems with low blood sugars after they're born a long term there certainly is\nFamily history that plays a part in whether or not your baby will be at risk for diabetes but again that is something that is as an older I'm an older adults really a or you know older an adult\nAs an older I'm an older adult really or or you know older an\nAdolescence uh maybe that your baby again would then be at risk again for diabetes\nOkay thank you okay thanks Julie over to Betty and ripped and Betty Iran\nHi thank you for taking my call her a question I'm about twenty eight years ago I\nFor my son was actually at ten months and months and I he had to be rushed to the neonatal um area of Albany medical center from Hudson hospital which didn't have an occult that\nNATO area so pretty much a three hours after he was born he went up to Albany by ambulance and about two hours after that I was released from the hospital and I was back considered\nPatient once I went and basically they welcome to make a nurse by Don in San Juan ensuring wow if things have changed in the last Twenty years and if there's like a different sensibility about a baby sit get rushed to larger hospitals\nAnd what happens to them\nWell unfortunately the we haven't fully come to our senses I'm not sure if that's actually the right things I should be saying\nWell you said it's an hour so why are\nWe we certainly again recognize when a baby obviously is sick and needs to be separated from um uh and in those situations yes we we do put our priority in to making sure that the baby is cared for and that\nBut unfortunately a mom's again I Want to be with their babies and needed a correct and and so while again is it important for a mom to be with her baby I also recognize that\nIn many times again they're babies aren't healthy enough to actually be with their moms either or and so that there is a moment of separation or that time of separation\nI'm I'm Sorry that you were a relegated to actually nursing in a small room\nOr you don't have ... already why I'm trying not to [noise] um we certainly again or don't do that anymore a mom's actually at ... or a baby that over the medical center actually are in are these in the NICU are in single rooms\nAre and their moms are certainly welcome to again be with their babies and if they are able to maybe breast feeding\nUp but you're right in that moms actually will not be transferred from an outlying hospital to the medical center\nOr if they're babies again are transferred a for a different reason\nDr phil of pan is our guest today on medical Monday eight hundred three for eight to five five one is the
