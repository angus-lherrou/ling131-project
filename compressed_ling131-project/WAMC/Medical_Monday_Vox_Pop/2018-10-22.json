your own country what can we do and reasons that we can't just allow that many people to arbitrarily show up in our border and just like wave 'em in without any vetting so\nListening actually on the right in the way here interviewed some of the guys in the care of and they said the aid that the U.S given them in their country is actually not being filtered from the government down to him down to them and that would prevent them from starting this care of and we can fix that very easily go down there make sure they're getting supplies to aid they need is coming from our country and can't Antonio's all caught up in class\nHave on them or other migrants from Honduras I Would note that I'm just important to make sure that we work diplomatically and constructively with our allies in this case Mexico they are coming through Mexico and I think I'm the administration has put a sort of complicated\nPerspective or position here by threatening to you know send military forces I Would encourage 'em a far more diplomatic\nUm cooperative a tenor a on a very complicated and difficult situation on the question of immigration that large we do have a broken immigration system\nThat needs to be fixed I Am for a clean DACA bill like clean DREAM Act on tethered to any sort of immigration reform ah I Do believe that we have to have a real career path to citizenship and we should achieve that on a bipartisan basis but here is the rub\nYou can't do that on a bipartisan basis when we have individuals in D.C who fanned the flames of phobia\nAh and we don't have individuals who take them to task when they do\nSo when the president decides it's appropriate to separate a child from his parents or her parents we need our members of Congress to step up and speak loudly against that the congressman didn't adopt\nBefore the judge President Trump issued executive order reuniting family or stopping the policy the day before house and fast with said he's kinda right the legal reality is make it such that they after Donald Trump or president\nOr decided that it was wrong to separate children from families and their parents or the Congress we thought that it was appropriate to say was morally wrong that kind of a quid vacating that kind of going back and forth is not the kind of moral leadership we need right now thank you Congressman John ...\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've ... to me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nI said right from the get go that separation of children and their parents at the border was wrong both morally and it has legal problems as well now the overall immigration system I've been one of those Republicans that has been fighting to get an immigration reform bill through the Congress I actually voted for one\nUnfortunately every single Democrat voted against that legislation which would affect stock which would have provided border security and on other reforms including dealt with the issue of separation of children at the border\nBecause the Democrats want the issue they don't want to solve the problem right now it is my hope after this election we can actually get some genuine reforms done\nUm agricultural labor I'm a co sponsor of bipartisan bill that I Hope we can pass in the lame duck session of Congress that would normalize the status of up to three million agricultural workers in the country in the Hudson Valley\nEvery farmer and in the Catskills every farmer tells you this is one of their biggest issues across our district employers tell you just generally they have jobs they can't find qualified people to fill the jobs\nSo we need to fix this immigration system I'm In the forefront of trying to do it and we also should be honest with our perspective constituents and not miss represent positions of others\n\nNow to the green field [laughter]\nThanks um boy is this ever not Ninety second question um each component of it let alone and all of them put together\nA you know of course I support DACA of course I support a path to citizenship for the dreamers are but it it's too small and too short sighted a discussion a Jew allowed to stand on its own\nI think this conversation needs to be expanded to all of the immigrant workers that are working in this country because they're all of equal value to this country and its economy\nAnd if you don't think so just ask any farmer ask anybody who owns a restaurant as anybody who owns a landscaping company ask anybody who owns a small contractor when you get work done at your home when you go buy food at a restaurant when you go buy food is a supermarket that food is being kept affordable to you and leaving Hewitt disposable income for other uses\nBecause immigrants are doing that work at incredibly low wages okay as far as the reform\nUm the congressman was talking about that farmers are are are hoping for it includes a ridiculous clause which is a forty five day period of returning people to their homes while they're in the middle of working\nHow is that what what does that do to protect our our immigration\nEverybody here to protect our border send them back for forty five days and bring them back again who's bearing the cost about why are we doing it if people are working here let them have a permanent work visa\nAnd looked at permanent work these it'd be something that can be gradually converted into permanent resident green cards that is and then from there into citizenship if they work productively pay taxes and live here long enough\nWhen they went so fast that did you want to see Steve misrepresented disposition this of this situation we would have a forty five day touch back every three years forty five days over a three year period\nThis is standard immigration practice otherwise we would be setting a parameters for this class of of immigrants to legalize themselves\nThat other people who have followed the law do not have to follow the forty five day touch back over a three year period is not owners are difficult they could do without a consulate in Canada for instance to their home country or go back to their home country and many of these folks actually do go back\n\nAnd I question a question goes to end\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've got struck me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for when three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nAnd I do not agree I mean in the\nCapital of Israel um\nOught to be ... and I think that uh\nYou know to get there we should do out I on a multi national basis I think unilaterally are moving in that direction sending the wrong signal\nTo the region or if we're going to be a neutral arbiter a and a credible are bitter and resolving what we know a is a very intense conflict in the middle east um we need to act like it or we need to bring to bear all of our diplomatic tools or to do so\nUm you know my wife uh is Jewish and my children are Jewish um and this matters a lot I mean she's done a lot of work going off to Israel for a number of\nI'm a career a path and it's become clear to me that um you know being pro Israel and being pro peace is critical but I'm also pro democracy and as currently constructed um\nYou know Israel is not a Jewish democracy or those settlements making so that it can't be so we've got to have a two state solution and in order to accomplish that we need to bring a real incredible thoughtful responsible leadership to bear\nI and I don't know right now that we have that in fact I'm pretty confident that that's lacking right now are the highest levels of government and so uh from my vantage point um that since she was the wrong way\nOkay John fast so you're a term Israel is not a democracy Israel is a strong democracy it is a vibrant democracy it's got a vibrant free enterprise system it's got a vibrant agricultural system and culture\nIsrael is a democracy there are our main democratic ally in that region\nAnd in fact moving the embassy to Jerusalem was the right decision you know I've had my differences on a policy with Donald Trump I've had my differences sometimes on how he says things and does things but the fact of the matter is\nMoving the embassy was the right decision Congress's for over Twenty years have said we pass laws to say that we should move our ... our embassy to Jerusalem that is the capital of Israel they our main ally in the middle east we should respect their point of view and this is a dangerous position that my my friend on on my right or\nAdopt he supports the Iran deal which\nBillions of dollars went to the Iranian regime and they are the main phone Mansour a dispute and discord and and war in that region they are a threat not only to Lebanon\nAnd two but also to the state of Israel and so are his his views on this issue but I'm astonished he does not believe Israel is a democracy Israel is a democracy\nIs now thirty seconds good classic example\nI said it is not a Jewish democracy\nMeaning that given the fact that we have settlements currently in the region um it is not a can be deemed a nation of ... a Jewish democracy\nAnd until we do with the settlements or we're going to have that issue\nObviously um the uh the the mission of Israel is always been a beacon of an example of what democracy can be in a very difficult\nUh um and violent region and we have always stood with Israel we were the first to acknowledge and recognize Israel after the war in terms of its sovereignty so the notion that I Would somehow be against this is ridiculous John faster take very\nThe fact is Israeli Arabs are represented in the ... other

personally so I got to make a decision based on on on knowing them personally and I always know that Hillary comes across as a little disingenuous just because of\nBeing very careful and cautious

I voted for Gary Johnson\nAnd why twenty two more seconds [laughter] and I think that's the faces for\nNow time for the closing statement and in fairness will go on the opposite order here and begin with two minutes we're dying Neal thank you thank you again\nThank for everyone for lifting and being so good and paying attention to say and I would say it's not easy especially when you know these are issues that were so important about\nUm [noise] I Would like to be our congressman because I Am like you I'm very much\nLike all of you it's it's really fun sometimes I think about it every time I say a woman that has like super fancy nail them like ooh she and I have nothing in common because I'm always doing the things that we we always do around here whether it's you know taking garbage says ran for station or chopping wood or giving rise to my neighbors are working on my own plumbing\nThat kind of thing [noise] and most of the candidates agree they didn't want someone that doesn't represent them [noise]\nYou know and if he is one of these things that is really hard to have naturally most people don't understand what it's like to live through experiences unless it's happened to them personally but I understand what it's like personally I guess that my parents are in Medicare my sister is on Medicaid\nOn October first I lost my health insurance because of this drunk driver and now I have a pre existing condition it is terrifying did not\nKnow I mean I've got you can hear about this ... got a cold I'm like oh great do I go to the doctor do I not go to the doctor and the choices that people have to make every day which is going to buy their food or were they going to buy their medicine\nAnd so many people like right now forty percent of the members of the house or lawyers super duper but how many of them don't have health insurance how many of them struggle how many of them know what it's like to worry about whether we are going to be able to get an education or help their family their friends with anything they have\nAnd we have big problems in our district we have no information and infrastructure we have regular infrastructure projects that we need it can't do their home or we can get to places farmers can't get their products out and people can't take advantage of the free market if they can't even have access to it by selling their things on line of starting a small business [noise]\nBut we need somebody that is not beholden to the parties we need somebody that they have not paid for that can go and say I will do this for you and in the house that may very well be spent Oh thank you Steve Israel\nA face to everybody for coming down thanks for the invitation it was really great to be here and we really need more of this more voices in our democracy and not fewer so thanks to WAMC for making this possible\nUm I Can't believe that I've been through a number of these debates already and we still haven't talked about the drug crisis because if we did I Would have had to tell you that none of the treatment modality as we currently use of recovery rate that's distinguishable from spontaneous remission and everything we're about to spend on it is going to be completely wasted\nA I Can't believe that we didn't talk about wages uh because the wages have remained stagnant in this country since Nineteen Seventy three relative to

got back in the Nineteen twenties the stock market is an irrelevant statistics to people who are now earning relative to GDP what they got into the night and in the Nineteen twenties and it's been a bipartisan effort to make this happen\nI Wish we talked a little more about poverty and what we need to do about it because as I mentioned in my opening\nIf we're not talking about poverty we're not talking about the costs of poverty we're not talking about the cost of crime we're not talking about the cost of education and more importantly the cause of lack of education the crime problem the expense we pay for it the prison overcrowding crisis mass incarceration of people in color\nOr an all coming from communities that are impoverished\nUm we really need to talk about these things because they are all obstacles that are in the way of achieving all the other things that we have been talking about and all of these obstacles were arrest raised and left addressed by both parties\nSo it's time to let one person into Congress and the other four hundred and thirty four will maintain the status quo for the people that are interested in that I'll just be one vote\nBut it's hard to get these conversations out onto the floor of Congress\nOut on the C SPAN where everyone can talk about it where the news will cover it thank you very much\nJohn facet well thank you to WAMC

district helping them with the issues that they face whether it's a veteran eating and disability\nBenefits determination or it's a a parent looking for how do they get treatment for their son or daughter who's addicted to opioids that's why I've translated this concern from our community into action in Washington as a freshman member of Congress I was the leader in the house of getting the stop act passed\nWhich will stop the flow of fat no coming into our country\nI've also been a leader fighting on the Agriculture Committee to improve the fortunes of art a dairy farmers organic

individuals who seem more interested in a\nPolitics as usual as opposed to politics for the people are and who seem more determined to to just see the position of power\nAt the expense of the community that they represent and we can change that now are we could change it because\nWe believe at this point in our country or the trends have gotten to a too far drift where the inequality is so staggering ah that unless we get some folks in there who have not\nBecome fluent and the language of partisanship and divisiveness were not career politicians who don't take corporate tax money on who believe Citizens United ought to be overturned in who believe that government ought to be for the people and by the people were going to keep going down this path\nA and I know the value of

turn thank you [noise]\nA debate um I Do wish that we had some sort of a grants program that would pay for a lot of other debates before we get down this close to having the uh non democratic and Republican candidates and\nI Hope to hurt anything and I think faster was hoping it hurts something which is a clever little or twenty two seconds after that question\nI I really fast so could afford to be a Mr magnanimous because that's really what comes into our old boxers\nOr from his campaign these horribly racist mailers Irish each three racist or antique Delgado mailers from fascists organization I'm a registered Democrat um so I Want to thank you for for holding this uh\nUh a debate and I hope that people support fast so because I I think we are latch fast so Delgado we've got to get rid of this fast of character thank you very much\nI think you very much for the call anybody want to comment well you didn't watch it you've thought Steve Greenfield at some point actually on of his own election hall ... said he's received and of course the nineteenth congressional district and saying that here's this black man scaring blond women and children I pretty much what he said yeah\nAnd then there was a reaction a ... reaction from the audience who was sitting there look this has been a big issue in this campaign of fat so has been saying I'm look I'm you know I I Can't control that that comes from Washington and it's a different group of people than I Am\nYou know I'm ... there is no question that um if John ... thought it was hurting him or he would say that the people in Washington you just cut it out and they'd cut it out\nBut it's ... it's obviously working or these when continue right I mean I hear your point but these ads keep going and they're coming from del got his camp as well I mean there there are untruths being told on both sides of the issue of the question is do you need to stick with the voters or motors going to go and vote based on the ad out of whatever party\nSome will be it I just want to say that I'm sort of proud of the decision that we had after a lot of hard meetings and a lot of time spent discussing it about including all the candidates\nUm we've had seven person Democratic primary debates we've had a five or six person attorney general democratic debate way back in twenty can where he left it open for Eric Schneiderman who never showed up\nSo it's not necessarily the mechanics of getting everybody up on that stage are but I'm proud of the artist Susan or just to say we're public radio or and you know maybe they're going to get one percent of the vote but that's not decided yet and I they have a right to be heard\nBut it's an important factor because there may be some who look at them and say well I may vote for one of the major party candidates based on something I heard here today and for every single vote in this district\nComing you better believe it or look we had a poll today that we saw in which there was a one point differential to understand how silly that is um it was a ... a quick ten is done in a on a queen queens one uh uh\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire

with the debate I have to say although I didn't hear one surprise from anybody could have been a so in the blank kind of debate but I wanted to point out\nThe cost of Social Security always befuddles me that no one wants to discuss the fact that Social Security is actually funded\nSystem where the younger people who were pay in and that supports the people who are retired but the biggest issue is Social Security starts with Paul Ryan and this gang who have been breaking unions as suppressing which wages which actually\nHave less money going into Social Security which gives them this why that they can tell that there's no money in the Social Security for the breaking of unions\nAnd keeping the middle class when just down is one of the biggest challenges a Social Security and I just wish that one of the candidates would point\nThat part of it out that it's not necessarily a savings account which actually funded count and it's the younger people are working are not making enough money are making less money because of union busting is one of them but also waged depression but that's the biggest threat to Social Security on the opinion on that\nWell I Do uh I got to tell you the years a Social Security trust fund was raided by the Congress that's how we we're balancing the budget because the cowards and Congress didn't want to come up with the money that they needed to fund the government\nUm and so uh you know ... if they had kept their hands off of it or they would be no problem now\nI think right hand gems like they're still\nTrying to get revenge on FDR's policies are trying to undo Social Security by making sure the nod and the money goes to ... to look at say it's broke I hear ya they're breaking it [laughter] All right I'll enjoy yourself you did a great job valid and really press\nThanks Rick go ahead house and by the way I think Steve Greenfield did a somewhat address that in his [laughter] his remarks I'm In any case you know we had an a A R P put out a Paul\nI'm On the on the ... ah they put an appalling rate and they also put out something on the issues on for just Antonio Delgado on congressman faster but what I wanted to say here and to the point of the pole in fact the fifty plus voter block it's the biggest voting bloc\nIn the nineteenth and so this is another you know that topic is extremely important Medicare Social security if you get to safety plots voting block out to vote and the polls by the way since the summer has been close this is the closest one we've seen but they I don't think there's been one more than five point difference\nWith no editing and Alison they'd been all over the place a win their votes that have shown they'll go winning and losing and it's all a bunch of bologna right\nNow it is the point is they've all been so close there's not one that had someone leading by ten twelve point\nIt's all about whether people come out and vote and the one thing that we didn't hear much about today and I was surprised was about Trump himself\nA because if this Congress goes over to the Democrat it for the first time one branch of government will be in a position or to hold Trump accountable so it's very interesting than in this whole thing nobody wanted to talk too much about Trump\nLet me jump in and say Allen on recorded a congressional corners series with Antonio Delgado that we'll be hearing in the coming days and pressed him on this very point about impeachment what the Democrats would do to hold his feet to the fire if they retake the house and uh for his part Antonio Delgado
