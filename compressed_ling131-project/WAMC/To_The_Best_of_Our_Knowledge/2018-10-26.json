out with people who make you feel comfortable\nMost of the time when I'm there I'm just being around Jewish people I'm not practicing religion it's just you know kind of a safe place where I feel comfortable with other people who are like me you know it's not\nTo discuss our views on God in heaven and hell is a real place or anything like that to be around\nPeople who are like me\nEpstein

community at home but that makes me appreciate it more when I can find it elsewhere like in summer ...\nAdam has heard every stereotype there is about people who are Jewish but these days he just
