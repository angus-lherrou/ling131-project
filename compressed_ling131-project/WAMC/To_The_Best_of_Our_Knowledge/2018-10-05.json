you should also be talking about a region that lead a very important part of early access and success and the ultimate allied victory Latin America\nIt seems are neighbors to the sounds were sorts of materials vital to the worst of both sides boils\nSo very important to them and it was Mexican oil\nToday on the best of our knowledge gets back to history class to learn about the role of Latin America in World War two we'll also spend an academic minute down there by the Amazon River and learn about the effects of dams on that reach\nI'm Bob Beck and this is the best of all\nThink about all the stories you've seen and read about World War two and I'll bet the words Latin America rarely if ever are involved but that region was vital to the war efforts of both sides of the conflict\nAnd that's the story told in Mary Jo McConnell ... new book called the tango war the struggle for the hearts mine enriches of Latin America during World War two\nMary Jo ... is an award winning journalist who covered wars in Central America and economics in the middle east she currently covers Latin America as an independent journalist we spoke about the book and I asked her why she wanted to tell this story\nI was always fascinated by World War two and I covered current gave wars in Latin America\nAnd I love Latin America and I'd already written memoirs and I wanted to write another but I wanted to write not about myself and I thought ... World War two and my dad who had been a naval officer in the war you tell me very intriguing stories but\nUnfortunately I think something that I had in common with many young people was I didn't listen thoroughly even though I enjoyed it when he was telling stories\nAnd when he was gone I had no way to satisfy my curiosity because I couldn't find a book in English that gave me the whole big picture between two covers so I decided to write the book I wanted to read\nOne of the things we think about when we think about World War two in Latin America is no war criminals escaping there after the war and you do get into that but you start off with oil and how important that was both for that region and how it ended up in Europe\nOil is absolutely essential to or any of the war machines\nAnd the United states of course one kid Mexico's Mexico had the largest reserves largest reserves at the time but Mexico had in the late Nineteen thirties nationalized its oil made it part of this skate\nRather than having the big oil companies more or less on it and use it at with the president of Mexico at that time lots of accounting is\nProbably the greatest president Mexico ever had with a Democrat\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu it'd\nAustria to protest the ... in the league of nations at that time he wanted to sell the Mexican oil at world market prices to France\nTo England to the United states\nBut the big oil companies standard Texaco shell that controls that trade boycotted Mexican oil they didn't want any laws to change the way they've been operating for all of those years\nBut also they did not want to set a precedent in which other Latin American countries would begin to take claim of their own oil\nThere were two mavericks that enables Mexican oil in the absence of the trade with the U.S and British companies\nWhich were extremely well funded and extremely effective wanted to find quote unquote goodwill ambassadors to bring to Latin America both to show that in them\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany mid now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\n... but also to show Americans that Latin Americans were neighbors and we're the allies in this fight\nOne of the most successful was Walt Disney he went down there with a group of Fifteen people from the studios they made films that were extremely popular they did not get rid of the stereotypes\nBut they made Latin Americans look friendly\nAnd that was the goal or one was called ... some egos another it's this kind of out yet or they also and this is not very well known made a host of health and sanitation films\nThat would be taken around by the U.S propaganda offices to a little villages or taken into the inner cities\nAnd shown to people as a way of increasing the possibility of better living better education and better health and of course because they were so enjoyable to listen and watch people really paid attention to them for some it was the first movie they'd ever seen\nAnd they would applaud at the end and wants to see them again he was quite an effective\nAmbassador Anne of all the training films says the Disney studios made back in the states for the U. S. army and navy and they didn't charge you know many other companies for General Motors made money during the war a Disney did it all pro bono\nWas Disney anti labor at one point yes was he's someone who seemed just connected from politics and have marks against his name or in many ways a in some social justice issues in the fifties and sixties yes\nBut during the war he was the model American and people love to them in Latin America\nWe spoke earlier about how a lot of ex Nazis after the war made it to Latin America and and live long lives near to what was the role of the Catholic Church and making that happen\nCatholic Church after the Russian Revolution\nExperience not only the loss of property in that huge huge huge Russian region\nBut also ordinary Catholics are the highest were murdered ... a priest and other leaders of the church uh were incarcerated tortured and murdered the church became viscerally anti communist\nAnd believed that the spread of communism would transcendental e essentially existential a challenge the continuation of the church\nAnd towards the end of the war it felt no when I say it's of course the church is not monolithic but there were individuals with in the church who were pretty high ranking including a couple of bishops\nWho understood that fascists Nazis would never never uh lose their immunity for communism\nAnd so the enemy of the enemy is my friend and one ship even said we must save same moral reserves as he put it to fight\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's

states we were able to pay\nMany ex Nazis including arguable war criminals to come to the United states and work for our defense industry is in our rocket industry some of these Latin countries were not able to pay quite as much\nWell nowhere near as early as much but they were able to offer safety and a roof over people's heads\nSo the rat lines as they're called went very often to Latin America and that's where you get all of these stories like the deaths of file and it's a film that has just been popular recently about the capture of Adolf Eichmann but all of this is rooted\nMany many years before\nAnd as I tried to point out in the book had affect many many years after because one for is the gun it just does not have limits in time as the war waged in Latin America shows it doesn't have limits in space\nWell I guess that's my final question is what is the legacy of the war in Latin America\nWell we'll never know how the government's which were turning pro democratic\nTowards the end of the war as many of them not all of them remember they had pretty much entered the war is dictatorships but\nThe war especially the victory of the allies and the Roosevelt four freedoms gave space to democratic forces in many of these countries a free press a labor students\nHour by that I mean the United states a counter espionage presence was run by J Edgar Hoover a very very famous anti communist\nAnd there was a tendency to be suspicious of these democratic movements and to support the more conservative right wing groups and of course\nThe United states was able to be president where before your was more the place that Latin countries looked to for culture and education then models they looked more to the United states after the war so\nYou know Bob we'll never know what the Latin American world would have been like without World War two but certainly the victory of the allies had an affect all over the world not least Latin America which is right next door\nAgain the name of Mary Jo McConnell ... new book is the tango war the struggle for the hearts minds and reduce the Latin America during World War two\n[noise]\n\nAs long as we're in South America let's have a ... about how dams of rubber changing the Amazon region that's the topic of today's academic minutes\nNew dams in the Amazon could threaten ecosystems I'm Dr Lynn pass Corolla president the

university\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nSource of food for thirty million people as being threatened by the rapid development of numerous dams across the Amazon basin I worked with an international team of researchers to examine the impact of the one hundred and forty two dams either in place are under construction and the one hundred and sixty more that are proposed\nProposed dams on Amazonian rivers could result in significant losses and river conductivity threatening fish populations in forever changing river channels and floodplains\nOur team collaborated with local governments and conservation organizations to compile international data on the dams we assembled the most comprehensive database of dams and the Andean Amazon region\nThe result is a system wide look at the overall impact which presents a very different picture than when assessing the impact of individual dams on individual systems\nEven though the Andean Amazon is only a small portion of the entire Amazon basin it really is important to the whole system\nThe majority of the sediments in the nutrients and much of the water that feeds the lately and Amazon comes from the Andes\nSeveral thousand species of fish also live in the base and many of which migrate from the land to the Andes for spying\nWe hope that by showing regional trends and showing that widespread river alteration is happening our research will encourage more coordinated development highlighting the importance of keeping some rivers free flowing in the Amazon\nWe have a big opportunity to preserve Amazon reverse which should be the focus of new initiatives for environmental conservation across the Amazon\nThat with Elizabeth Edwards at Florida International university you can find a death other segments and more information about the professors and academic Minnesota oh Archie\nThe
