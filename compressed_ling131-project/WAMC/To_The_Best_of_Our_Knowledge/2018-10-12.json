the academic minute Stephen ... assistant professor in the graduate school of social work at ... college examines help some but not all older adults benefit from helping others\nStudies associate volunteering with improve mood leading some to recommend volunteering to older adults who might be otherwise isolated\nBut the research has a few problems it's hard to determine whether the ... comes from the pro social aspect of volunteering from helping others or from the social contact these activities typically provide\nSecondly we don't know whether people who are generally happier tend to volunteer whether volunteering contributes to being happier the research has shown correlation not causation\nThird we are taught to size that volunteering help some people but not others based on individual characteristics in our study we split older adults into three groups one group imagine the pro social activity one group I imagine they surely social activity and the control group imagine a neutral activity\nWe found that only those who scored high on social responsibility a measure of how much they valued responsibility towards others experience more positive aspect and the pro social condition compared to the social or neutral conditions\nIn fact those who scored lower an altruistic orientation and measure of how connected you feel towards others reported greater negative emotion when imagining a pro social behavior compared to those who scored high\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and

social behavior is connected to your value system and personality if you don't value helping others or feel particularly connected to them volunteering is not going to make you happier\nAnd it may
