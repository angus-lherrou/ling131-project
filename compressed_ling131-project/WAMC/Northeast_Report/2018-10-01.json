the coalition to fight for a number of issues WAMC use Hudson Valley bureau jeep Alison done spoke with Robert catch them about the new initiatives\nCast and lost the Democratic primary and the forty of senator ... who faces incumbent Republican tyrants Murphy and November ... has turned his attention to establishing a nonprofit nonpartisan organization coalition New York has been has been reaching out to organizations across all sixty three state Senate districts to join his coalition\nWe will not be monolithic we will not be single issue focused our goal is to get these groups to understand that when they work in concert with others across the state they end up with more clout and they end up with a greater ability excuse me to impact\nLegislators in the legislative branch the executive branch and the various agencies that serve the needs of of New Yorkers so we'll be doing that outreach will be asking people to join our coalition\nAnd we will be then setting an agenda with those\nOrganizations and institutions\nTo maximize our viability in terms of pushing for a more transparent cleaner New York\nHow does this differ from some of the other nonprofit nonpartisan groups out there like good government groups that seemed to have similar rains\nLooking for people and groups that are already somewhat established to work together\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from

... these coalitions will then support those groups in achieving their goals as well so we're not just looking for them to say OK let's do good government\nWhich is vitally important but we also want these coalition partners to then back up these other groups on the legislation that's important to them\nSo for example if there's something on the environmental side but you have a group as part of your coalition that cares more about the campaign finance reform then that same coalition to then get behind the environmental cause\nExactly that way they're much much stronger\nHe speaks to coalition New York's spoken leading up to the November six general election\nWhat will be pushing for limits on what money should be taken and how it should be taken and how it should be spent\nBecause money definitely is a big concern I mean that will be on for both sides of the aisle and we will try as hard as we can to make the public aware of exactly who's giving what and what is being spent\nAnd how uh everything should be transparent you shouldn't be able to get favors for one that's not a favor for the other\nUh we saw that in our own campaign and we're hoping that that will stop going towards the general election\nAnd catch them details more about campaign finance reform\nOr a New York state Senate candidate can take seven thousand dollars per individual in the primary at eleven thousand dollars per individual in the general election that's Eighteen thousand dollars per person so\nIf you're a family of four that's a lot of money if you're a business that's a lot of money I'm In New York state you can take the money you can take corporate money or that means that there's an awful lot of people looking for a pound of flesh at the end of the day\nAlso the amount of money that can be spent by\nOther groups that are supposed to not coordinate with the campaigns there's way too much money going into that uh so that allows people to maintain a clean campaign and I say that in quotes um while their\nCompatriots attacking this member their political opponents and we've\nSeen that over and over and over again and that's really unconscionable and very bad for our political system what should the limit me\nI Would say that it wouldn't be outrageous to limit to twenty five hundred dollars in the primary and twenty five hundred dollars in the general election\nThe only people who might suffer a bit are consultants because the campaigns would probably have to raise a lot less money but five thousand dollars is probably not going to buy anybody\nUm and if we have to really declare people who were uh raising additional funds to business associates or other kinds of things that\nWould have to be very well stated a but we should also eliminate the corporate contributions eliminate corporation I'm a liberal eliminate contributions from people who are not citizens which is okay in New York a ... and by eliminating those kinds of things and certain packs\nFrom the process we would certainly clean up this very messy situation much more quickly than just about anything else\nHe sent polish in New York is about putting people
