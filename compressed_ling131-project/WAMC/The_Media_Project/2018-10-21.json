signal from our producer David you've seen it here we'll see if there is in sight\nI'm Rick Smith editor of the times union here with Dr Alan ... cars CEO Northeast Public radio sir hello wrecks and here we are with David or\nJust to look very who'd be your son is ... ... it was a wonderful Times Union reporter his mom the former editor of the Saratoga and in the record\nIs now teaching and you

don't even think I'm sure they can tell when I'm sitting in ... that's really made them bum bum anyway it's good to see you in whatever capacity you may be Alan and I hope your backfield better soon otherwise you maybe you're just trying to heal\nSmarter than the rest of us 'cause being above it sort of has been counting out there you go well it's a good thing anyway we have a some mail from a listener in Charleston South Carolina how 'bout that super says you can download the app and listen to ... and see anywhere\nFrom Rob in Charleston says I'm a weekly listeners should the media projects and I would like to ask you to discuss the coverage of Trump rallies actually we dealt with this in passing\nA couple of weeks ago why is it that even MSNBC and NBC give him so much coverage and you rarely see democratic rallies I'm sure that lives with war in Iraq a bomb a Bernie Sanders among others are getting spirited really too but\nI never see them made it appears that the mainstream media is falling into the same trap that they were in twenty sixteen giving Trump millions of dollars in free advertising while shutting out the Democrats and\nI think our listeners that's absolutely right we should not be providing so much coverage\nBut the problem is if something newsworthy happens the journalists need to be there to bear witness and share it with the people who are not in attendance or did not see the rally so we have an obligation to be there as journalists at the same time we don't want to give him all those millions of dollars that our listeners so rightly made mentioned not\nYes I totally agree and and not only is he getting\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com leave ability to the things that he is saying\nAnd says well we don't know it's not been proven even though the Turks believe that they have\nAudio of him being killed and its member and tortured the president of the United states when they start to quiz him about it he gets nasty with the reporters who were quizzing him about it so I think it's entirely appropriate considering the context that he is set up about how bad the presses and one more thing on that if I may\nAnd that is look the press has done some things that I consider to be despicable\nYou take a look I always say that directs look at the New York post look at this and that and then what happens is along comes trumpet he attacks the press and as one the media probably appropriately rises up and you do this like when you say a press can do now\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nDown if I'm wrong and injustices in society jak and this particular instance this is a human rights issue the fact that it's a journalist from those of us who have a deep interest in journalism we can see this is especially egregious obviously this is an effort to silence voices especially a voice who was dissenting\nFortunately the Washington Post was able to publish ... last column very recently and which one was the last thing he wrote about the ability for people to speak freely and the value of his ability to be able to speak freely because\nIn many of these countries like Saudi Arabia as he wrote citizens are either ill informed or misinformed because they're in freedom of the press and the absence of information is really what is the perils of democracy you can't have effective democracy if people are lied to\nOr if the press doesn't get access to information which is why going back to the arguments about our president which is why we need to be so aggressive about fair eating out his lives because that is what leads to the demise of democracy\nBut we know that his allies the Washington Post as I'm up there two thousand lives three thousand lives whatever it is worth more than we were four thousand lies so they do so what it says if water is falling off the ducks back\nThis is the new normal is is the way things are so why do you know who cares if this is not Allen speaking now Allen talking about what certain people particularly people in the Republican Party are saying\nThat first show he I really hope that the national media and local media to keep it alive don't bury the story there's so many crazy things that keep happening\nIn this administration and in the world we cover it and then we move onto the next thing and we kind of forget to stay on top of the horrible thing that they're trying to distract us from remembering and\nSo many topics that need a large ... that it's hard\nNot to track we have to keep telling readers keep telling listeners every day what still going on well you know and that's hard and that is hard to do\nYou know it's interesting it came out in the beginning and you get guys like Lindsey Graham on him I don't like and other people and they were making it clear Trump better not do this and not not take this terrible murder and put it under the under the rug and then all of a sudden that chorus of Republican senatorial voices\nHas become dissipated and muted and more and more muted now it's up\nTo the media that's where it comes into the media to a point that out hey Lindsey Graham the first day you were irate how can we haven't heard so much irate in his late ...\nYeah well you know I think it color is manila he folds\nIt's a just kind of ridiculous he he always gives up after I'm huffing and puffing\nAre pointed an editorial on this topic was what we don't know is whether the president's silence on this topic you know Donald Trump suggesting maybe rogue agents were responsible for the killing of ... which term I don't think was his own I think that was put in to his head 'cause that's not telling Trump's words he would have said you'll bad but\nUh but a rogue agents perhaps did this he suggested and maybe that's because he has financial stake in an area being or financial say have a big sticking him certainly\nThey take him bragging about in during the election all the money that he has been getting from the Saudis and they play it on the tape now he gets up and he lives again and he says I don't have any relationship with any physical relationship with them at all\nThen why do we not have sanctions\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com and no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nYou know the good thing that's going on in the press has been able to take all of those pictures of the road guys who supposedly road guys who showed up and then they show pictures of them with their friends so it's really something\nSo through all kinds of how it follows is one of them is the Washington Post has this blog in which they have contributors partisan contributors from around the community\nPost partisan blood so they have like partisan and one of them are one of their bloggers is a a very powerful lobby is named Ed Rogers he's chairman of the Bee Gees yard group which is a major loving from the\nPost's just told him if you don't drop Saudi Arabia as your client you will not be allowed to write for us anymore and that is I think until literally I give up that\nI think that it's fascinating because the company for homeless lobbyists works is making eighty thousand dollars a month from Saudi Arabia is our movement and they've determined they would not take any more money from Saudi Arabia while this crisis is unveiling yet repealing it\nWas ... because there's for so many decades we in the press have tried to say that we're going to present different points of view you can be coming from different places and now we're suddenly deciding which places you can represent who you can be affiliated with\nStill in this particular example I think it's an excellent move on the Washington Post part but I ... but I see the issues because you can go more than one way on the table but\nJournalism is something about values certain values have to be representing your journalism and if the preservation of human life is not a value if you don't stand up and say we're not going to have anything to do with you if you are an associate of murders\nWhich seems to be what is the case if you're an ally of Saudi Arabia this case I think it's entirely appropriate for the Washington Post to do this so\nBut I uh anyway Raymond adventure thing questions about censorship and truly does and who gets hurt and who doesn't get hurt and who has the power to have access to audiences just like this program right here we have a big responsibility here what we're saying should matter and we should be very careful in our word choice and the ideas that were shooting to\nShare on this platform it's ... I guess when I was speaking\nAt a public gathering at a civic event last week\nAnd the guy came to me and was attacking me over something that Rosemary our mail set on this program in January of twenty Seventeen\nAnd he actually then sent me a tape of it ah Rosemary had made some a negative comment about something that the president said in his state of the union address and this guy was attacking me for having not taken Rosemary to task when she was going through this long piece that\nShe was talking about so be careful because we all have guilt by association of things that each other's says oh you\nKnow [laughter] I'm not responsible for the Allen says [laughter]\nOh well if you're just joining us it's the Media Project from Northeast Public radio I'm Rick Smith with Ellen ... around and we thank you for joining us media at WAMC it up or gee is how you can reach us\nBy so during the fund drive a withdrew or just a verdict federally yeah a lot of people go up and said the Media Project should be an hour I don't want to [laughter] I don't want to start all over again let me just say [laughter] oh well\nWhat can you do we want to talk of just a little bit before where our time is up about college students a new poll says that in the news media consumption study almost half of the college students\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no ... no ...
