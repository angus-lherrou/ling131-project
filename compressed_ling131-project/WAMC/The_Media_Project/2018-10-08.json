I'm a I was raised feeding hardly ... oh okay well I'm buttons but\nTo ask but I'm going to ask you this the New York times comes out with this incredible report I heard one report that said they had an extra ... to the times to cover this major report\nHow many people are good I read it number one and what are the takeaways from it you know the interpretations have been very different\nThe White House was so scared about it that they had to come out and say you know it's not true and respond to it that way and then the people who love the Trump White house who said well they all do it so it's okay [laughter] you know it's okay they're all doing\nTo me that take away was hey I don't cheat on my taxes and if I get somebody would be knocking on my door and saying let me or to you and here's the president in the United states who's getting away with it that added that soon tire turns you huge excellent\nProbably Pulitzer winning approach is probably the only take away that I can\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nWas hey I don't cheat on my taxes and if I did somebody would be knocking on my door and saying let me or to you and here's the president in the United states who's getting away with it that out of the ... tired ... huge excellent\nProbably Pulitzer winning approach is probably the only take away that I can walk away with\nWell I Walk away with the fact that lawlessness does not navigate a person getting elected to the highest office in the land or eventually perhaps the highest court clearly laws were broken tax laws are in place the IRS appear to fail to do its job\nAnd I don't know if the people who should be reading this will be reading it but it seems that individuals who are concerned that they are paying too much in taxes would wonder why they weren't afforded the same opportunity and the same breaks also the people who tended to vote for the current president\nOr the very people who then have their services cut and don't get the sort of government help that they might\nNeed they do that because I Wonder about that every day I scratch my takeaway was thank goodness for journalism I mean and for the New York times\nYou know small papers tend to say oh yeah well that's New York times they can do these kinds of things but if you read it they did some hard digging and they also did some basic shoe leather journalism by you know knocking on doors repeatedly calling people get into the river from Asia requests\nFor sales my lingering question though is you know how did they get those big boxes of tax returns from Fred Trump\nIs the ... how did they land a lot of the documents because they must have been difficult\nTo get you know I was gonna say what Judy said I think it's just remarkable from a journalistic standpoint\nThis is the sort of thing go to New York times is almost uniquely capable of doing\nPutting these three or four reporters giving them their own office they were the only ones that had the key to the office locking them away and and them doing this kind of reporting is astonishing to me an encouraging to me\nThat's one but one day is the fact that Trump over the long haul has so prime the pump among his base to be sure\nTo not believe for the New York times to not believe what what is real factual journalism that there are people many people too many people who are shrug this off as just another job by the liberal media and\nAll that is what he said he said this is another job\nNot a hit job at document based digging it's all fact based and double checked and triple check and I'm not arguing that I Know\nI I you're quoting the president in the United states who says it to his base which eighty seven percent or something like that women and men believe everything the guy says and he says it's another his job and guess what color they believe that\nYou know I like the fact that they printed it all in one day seven pages just chock full of information printed on one day it had more of an impact and\nThe traditional big story like that would have been spread over several days\nYeah the thing that I thought a little bit short was interactive pieces that they had I\nUm maybe it's just because I'm a reader but I was fascinated by the quality of the writing and I didn't really bother to look at a lot of the interactive that they had posted and defining directive for shooting but that would be they had an interactive map where you can zoom in and see where these buildings were that they were talking about they had some videos\nAgain from my perspective I wanted to get through and actually read the words\nWell if you listen to this program on Sunday night at six get to a TV said that I'm thirty on Showtime there is going to be done\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu and defining\nDirective for shooting but that would be they had an interactive map where you can zoom in and see where these buildings where that type of talking about they had some videos again from my perspective I'm going to get through and actually read\nThe words well if you're listening to this program on Sunday night\nAt six get to a TV set a nine thirty on Showtime there is going to be a documentary\nAbout this whole story and the process parents ethically one of the producers is a kings to native but a ... that it is very important to kings donates but if you're already watching the circus on Showtime which many of us do this is on right after it tonight I thought they had keys to the office as well [laughter]\nLet's go to a little bit more pleasant or perhaps hopeful news or perhaps not and that's the increasing reliance and growth of non profit news sites in the light of what is going on in our industry which has been largely negative financially that New York times investigative story not withstanding\nThere is a corner of the Institute for non profit news estimated revenues of between three hundred and twenty five to three hundred and fifty million dollars has been generated by non profit news sites\nAnd that upwards of three thousand people have been employed by the sights twenty two hundred of of whom are journalists and that also comes on the heels of a profit making venture as which would be the Philadelphia Inquirer Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nAnd something called the gal and the media group which has announced that they're working together to cover the state Capitol in Pennsylvania pointed exactly\nAbout that cooperation if you remember\nThat people would do anything that would have been unimaginable before I I wanted to ask you a question as somebody who was a publisher and editor\nAnd know that stuff backwards and forwards and that is how bad is the ... in the commercial press in other words we know they're making less money than they did we know they're firing a lot of people when I Want to know and I think all Americans want to know is how much\nHow in danger is that commercial press are they in danger of going out of business in some cases they have but you know right here in Albany ... Times Union we have other places and you know I Know there's a lot of seeing the blues by these folks but how bad it\nWell the short answer is it's bad I mean how bad it's very bad life in danger in fear is that there I think before you see a number of publications literally go out of business on the front side you're going to see an increasing number of daily newspapers district the number of days they print\nOkay so back to your original question do you think that if you're the publisher let's say you're the publisher of a local paper maybe the times you maybe have Schenectady pay were Judy's the work and you look and you see WAMC for example last year is approaching\nFour million dollars in underwriting on that station do you get sick to the stomach do you think hey maybe that was the money that used to be mine get angry\nAs a former publisher and then it's not just WAMC it's all of the other print and broadcast competitors that has sprung up and the last ten or Fifteen Years taking a bite of the pie that we used to control them if you did a pie chart in in my market a relatively small market in the old days when I started in the in the seventies\nYou could look at that pie chart and see the size of a piece of pie but it's pretty much all of it would be daily Freeman advertising revenue and then there would be this one little slice that went to the local radio station [noise] well that's slice of the pie is changed dramatically I don't have the most recent numbers but I dare say that the daily news\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot EDU\nIn the old days when I started in the seventies\nYou could look at that pie chart and see the size of a piece of the pie but it's pretty much all of it would be daily Freeman advertising revenue and then there'd be this one little slice it went to the local radio station [noise]\nWell that's slice of the pie is changed dramatically I don't have the most recent numbers but I dare say that the daily newspaper which used to get Ninety percent is now getting less than fifty percent to ...\nYou were the editor of the Schenectady paper major paper in our area certainly you and your ear to the ground with the grumbling\nWisdom happiness or the other guys are getting so I think there's always been competition and underwriting at WAMC I Know we call it underwriting and put it sound like ads to me I Know [laughter] and that well that means they're not\n[laughter] but they are they just have some restrictions that that's\nAlways been to cater to people that are scooping up or reading most of the pie or Facebook and Google that's really the problem I mean that's the competition and the local market is always been there you just have to make the case I think as you get the convergence of media where and newspapers are traditional media offer audio where patients like WAMC offer print on line\nWe get the convenience you can see more of the competition for the local college\nI tend to disagree a little bit with Ira about how bad it is for print media I'm optimistic that these small local community newspapers will\nWill continue to survive and perhaps even thrive they're coming to a reckoning about how they spend their money\nThat you know I was going to say that but based on what Judy I mean after all they're firing a lot of their\nBorders you know there's still a lot of money coming in through subscriptions and you know I look at this story about the local non profit news sites generating three hundred and twenty five million dollar and revenue well as someone who used to run in his room and saying okay there's a there's a revenue about what were the expenses\nYou know and I'm guessing that your experience with the ... which was a privately owned family owned newspaper is different than what most of us now have experience because we've been purchased by corporations where there is more of a bottom line mentality\nI still want to know what's going through that publishers head as they see their profit decreasing\nA lot of getting better five years ago when I was still publishers what was going through my head is I think it's time to retire\nYou know newspapers have happened to get used to the idea that the profit margins weren't what they used to be and what they were in the sixties and satellites when my wedding that's my question Judy what I don't know is\nWhen you say you're doing worse how worse is it out the door or you're done with that but I Know", "show_name": "The Media Project", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "08"}
