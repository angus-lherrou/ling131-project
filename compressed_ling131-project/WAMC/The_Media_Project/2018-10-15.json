two three WAMC so the important thing here is that if you look at what are the word trigger means is that if you if you give\nMakes the donation viable if you don't it\nDoes nothing not for us not for the family of four so this isn't a foregone conclusion\nThat the idea of this is that we are triggering ... so we have to do our part to make sure that everybody gets now what is lovely about this um\nIs your one hundred dollars goes to feed a family of four for three months I think about that that's that is that is three\nOut of the twelve months a year that we have to a season now what [noise]\nWhat is so beautiful and so gratifying and doing this is that\nUh when we do this people are so generous we have a now each each donation the way we do it the way we keep track of it is we have stickers and the sticker say food pantry family of four and it has a number of it now I have to eat them yes\nAnd so we have we already we just started this a moment ago and we already have a forms in front of us were there's one sticker and there's three sugars and there's five stickers and there's ten stickers so in other words instead of helping one family they're helping free five ten now whatever you can do great\nOne eight hundred three two three nine to sixty but we have the opportunity to help four hundred families in our region\nFor three months to feed them through the food

think of as as reckless and concerning mostly having to do with the with the climate however um what else not saying that the situation is not getting a much worse\nFor all of the crowing about the economy anyone who is in this business of feeding the a feeding the hungry and sheltering the homeless\nKnows that this is a a a bad time and the need is only growing unless you're a millionaire already rights case now and find the other thing too is that I I Want to I just want to differentiate\nWhen we say hungry there there is a a a term that is used in the business and I was not familiar with this term until they started coming in or cure food insecurity and what this means is that you you unlike many hum of us who are lucky enough\nDon't know perhaps where your next meal's coming from and you can't plan for that now you and I said well we have a salary and we have we have money that comes in and we know what that money is and we can plant [noise] but if you don't have that\nAnd you don't know if you're going to get a hundred dollars next week or not then you and you have to feed your family that how do you do that\nSo this this allows us to\nFeed a family of four four hundred dollars and this idea of food insecure is too for those families\nWho are using a food pantry and by the way let's just get this out of the way right now because I hear it a lot\nFrom certain quarters not so much our audience but maybe outside of this audience\nIf people just got off their apples and and I try and get a job they wouldn't need a food pantry except just they got a job paying twelve dollars an hour even among which have a family\nTo feed and you know one ... and a car and diapers and everything on a car that's you know\nHow many people have a car a lot of people after work a bus or\nEven or even to pay for the public transportation whatever the case may be so um but but the interesting thing about food pantries and and the ... and if I'm if we do this again will will ever come in and talk about this but what what is what is fascinating is that\nMost of their people and I don't know what the exact number is I don't have to find this out for you but but a large number of the people\nUse it part time in the sense of they go in when they needed and then they don't go back until they don't need a you know they stop when they don't need it and then they go back when they needed to get [noise]\nIt's not welfare\nIs not on our dime right it's people who are hungry and we're helping people who need it we have to get out of the mindset\nThat there are

opportunities to help people\nNow if we have any laughs at the end of our time together and that's an excuse me because you can't tell me that out of the hundreds of thousands of people that we have listening to the hundreds of thousands of people that we have listening we can't find four hundred people\nWho are willing to volunteer and to\nBasically adopt a family of four\nAnd provide the money
