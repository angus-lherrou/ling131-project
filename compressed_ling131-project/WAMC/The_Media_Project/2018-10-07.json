Northeast Public radio good day Allen\nGood day Iran I have to thank you all for being here it's not easy to do it and the ... gone it's very very powerful statement bakery well I just think that the obvious thing to say is your full of Vilonia [laughter] actually Ira I'm going to be honest with you I was gonna say [laughter] and then I got diverted\nIf there's anyone here who has corner your

longest system of Puerto Rico's in the world everywhere every building has a senior in front of it if you could walk on\nIs there a media story to tell before we get to the U.S media stories I'm\nGlad you asked there there is absolutely no means [laughter] except that for years it's been a very left wing city with a left wing press and ruled by in the old days anyway and in some of it has come down by the communists\nAnd I heard you say that you watch the cabin or hearing so you got CNN in the in\nIt yeah the one o'clock in the morning 'cause it's six hours ahead watched the Kavanaugh hearings it was just I mean\nIt was it any better in the middle of the night that it was in the morning here trust me it was no no I wouldn't have thought so well we have a variety of things we might talk about we we get to some good news I guess it would be considered good news let's talk about the White House it's hard to avoid Trump White house no matter what we talk about these days\nBut there is a report that until the race in Prescott\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThere was only one White House press briefing for the entire month of September\nAnd then at the most recent semi press conference that Trump had which he tagged on after the announcement of the trade deal with Canada among other things Trump how shall I say it I'll use the word this but it's probably too light already did two female network reporters\nLet's pat ourselves on the back collectively for by the way this is the Media Project ... brown Judy Patrick announced charge like here on Northeast Public radio and all of our affiliates around the country [noise]\nThe New York times did a remarkable job by most measurements except Sara Sanders\nA with this little rather long investigative piece about the Trump and the tax situation than Trump's father on and on and on it just seems like something that could eventually be a movie like spotlight was in terms of the digging that was required for this\nI'm not asking really anything except do we not all sit here and marvel at the store as Alan going to take a country of you [laughter]\nYou're almost inviting after I wanted I wanted to see it on\nYour cell okay so here's the deal did up by the way it is for you guys who were ... people\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu no I was\nRaised reading a hearty oh okay well I'm Britain to him but I'm going to ask but I'm going to ask you this the New York times comes out with this incredible report I heard one report that said they had to add extra ... to the times to cover this major report\nHow many people are good I read it number one and what are the takeaways from it and the interpretations have been very different\nThe White House was so scared about it that they had to come out and say you know it's not true and respond to it that way and then the people who love the Trump White house who said well they all do it so it's okay [laughter] you know that it's OK they're all doing it\nTo me that take away was hey I don't cheat on my taxes and if I did somebody would be knocking on my door and saying let me or to you and here's the president in the United states who's getting away with it that out of this and tired ... huge excellent\nProbably Pulitzer winning approach is probably the only take away that I can walk away with\nWell I Walk away with the fact that lawlessness does not negate a person getting elected to the highest office in the land or eventually perhaps the highest court clearly laws were broken tax laws are in place the IRS and appear to fail to do its job\nAnd I don't know if the people who should be reading this will be reading it but it seems that individuals who are concerned that they are paying too much in taxes would wonder why they weren't afforded the same opportunity and the same breaks also the people who tended to vote for the current president\nOr the very people who then have their services caught and don't get that sort of government help that they might\nNeed they do that because I Wonder about that every day I scratch\nMy takeaway was thank goodness for journalism I mean and for the New York times you know small papers tend to say oh yeah well that's New York times they can do these kinds of things but if you read it they did some hard digging and they also did some basic shoe leather journalism by you know knocking on doors repeatedly calling people getting some freedom of information request\nFor sales my lingering question though is you know how did they get those big boxes of tax returns from Fred Trump\nIs ... how did they land a lot of the documents because they must have been difficult to get\nYou know I was gonna say what Judy said I think it's just remarkable from a journalistic standpoint\nThis is the sort of thing that New York times is almost uniquely capable of doing\nPutting these three or four reporters giving them their own office they were the only ones that had the key to the office locking them away and and them doing this kind of reporting is astonishing to me an encouraging to me\nThat's one but one day is the fact that Trump over the long haul has so prime the pump among his base to be sure\nTo not believe for the New York times to not believe what what is real factual journalism that there are people many people too many people or shrug this off as just another job by the liberal media and\nAll that is what he said he said this is another job\nNot a hit job at document based digging it's all fact based and double checked and triple check and I'm not arguing so I Know\nI I you're quoting the president of the United states who says it to his base which eighty seven percent or something like that women and men believe everything the guy says and he says it's another his job and guess what color they believe that\nYou know I like the fact that they printed it all in one day seven pages just\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAdditional big story like that would have been spread over several days\nYeah the thing that I thought a little bit short with interactive pieces that they had I\nUm maybe it's just because I'm a reader but I was fascinated by the quality of the writing and I didn't really bother to look at a lot of the interactive that they had posted and defining director for shooting and that would be they had an interactive map where you can zoom in and see where these buildings where they were talking about they had some videos\nAgain from my perspective I wanted to get through and actually read the words\nWell if you listen to this program on Sunday night\nAt six get to a TV set a nine thirty on Showtime there is going to be a documentary\nAbout this whole story and the process parents ethically one of the producers is a kings to native but a lot of important that it is very important to kings donates but if you're already watching the circuits on Showtime which many of us do this is on right after it tonight I thought they had keys to the office as well [laughter]\nLet's go to a little bit more pleasant or perhaps hopeful news or perhaps not and that's the increasing reliance and growth of non profit news sites in the light of what is going on in our industry which has been largely negative financially that New York times investigative story not withstanding\nThere is a corner of the Institute for non profit news estimated revenues of between three hundred and twenty five to three hundred and fifty million dollars has been generated by non profit news sites\nAnd that upwards of three thousand people have been employed by the sights twenty two hundred of of whom are journalists and that also comes on the heels of a profit making venture is which would be the Philadelphia Inquirer Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nAnd something called the gal and the media group which has announced that they're working together to cover the state Capitol in Pennsylvania but for the exactly\nAbout that cooperation if you remember\nPeople doing things that would have been unimaginable before I wanted to ask you a question as somebody who was a publisher and editor\nAnd know this stuff backwards and forwards and that is how bad is the ... in the commercial press in other words we know they're making less money than they did we know they're firing a lot of people when I Want to know and I think all Americans want to know is how much\nHow in danger is the commercial press are they in danger of going out of business in some cases they have but you know right here in Albany ... Times Union we have other places and you know I Know there's a lot of seeing the blues by these folks but how bad it\nWell the short answer is it's bad I mean how bad it's very bad life in danger rings yes she said yeah I think before you see a number of publications literally go out of business on the front side you're going to see an increasing number of daily newspapers district the number of days they print\nOkay so back to your original question do you think that if you're the public you let's say you're the publisher of a local paper maybe the times you may be some Schenectady pay what you to use the word and you look and you see WAMC for example last year is approaching\nFour million dollars in underwriting on this station you get sick to the stomach do you think hey maybe that was the money that used to be mine get angry\nAs a former publisher and then it's not just WAMC it's all of the other print and broadcast competitors that has sprung up and the last ten or Fifteen Years taking a bite of the pie that we used to control them if you did a pie chart in in my market a relatively small market in the old days when I started in the in the seventies\nYou could look at that pie chart and see the size of\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nAdvertising revenue and then there'd be this one little slice it went to the local radio station will that slice of the pie is changed dramatically I don't have the most recent numbers but I dare say that the daily newspaper which used to get Ninety percent is now getting less than fifty percent to ...\nYou were the editor of disconnected he paper major paper in our area certainly you at your ear to the ground with the grumbling\nWas unhappiness or the other guys are getting so I think there's always been competition and underwriting at WAMC I Know we call it underwriting but it sounded like ads to me I Know [laughter] and that well that means they're not [laughter]\nBut they are they just have some restrictions\nThat that's always fun to cater to people that are scooping up or reading most of the pie or Facebook and Google that's really the problem I mean that's the competition and the local market is always been there you just have to make the case\nI think as you get the convergence of media where and newspapers are traditional media offer audio where stations like WAMC offer print on line\nWe get the British you're going to see more of the competition for the local college\nI tend to disagree a little bit with Ira about how bad it is for print media I'm optimistic that these small local community newspapers will\nWill continue to survive and perhaps even thrive they're coming to a reckoning about how they spend their money I feel I was going to say that but based on what\nJudy I mean after all they're firing a lot of their borders\nYou know there's still a lot of money coming in through subscriptions and you know I look at this story about the local non profit news sites generating three hundred and twenty five million dollar and revenue well as someone who used to run in his room and saying okay there's ... there's the revenue about what were the expenses\nYou know sure and I'm guessing that your experience with the ... which was a privately owned family owned newspaper is different than what most of us now have experience because we've been purchased by corporations were there is more of a bottom line mentality", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Media Project", "city": "Albany", "day": "07"}
