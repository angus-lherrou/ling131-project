New York nicer and Judy Patrick formerly editor of the ... in Schenectady and are now with the New York press association gay man gave him a ... so we have a lot\nTo talk about here by the way before we get started there is a public service announcements from a retired school librarian and the public library trustee thank you Pauline who\nBecause we invite our readers to read it and she pointed out that after the debate that she had just seen between the nineteenth congressional district candidates there was a short discussion concerning the difficulty in separating fact from fiction and she hopes to remind our listeners that real research consist of more than a five minute Google Search\nAnd that their school in public libraries enough to find a plethora of valid and appropriate sources in fact more schools had full time librarians who are given the time to partner and coordinate with teachers starting in elementary school we could be educating everyone was true research skills in all forms\nOf media in these difficult times it is more important than ever to make sure the libraries and librarians or support in our town in school budgets\nTo which I say bravo bravo indeed you know we worry we talk a lot of the show about people not having the analytical skills that good reading of the media\nDoesn't educated a readership might could give them\nThis is a a potential solution here anyway we have to talk today about some of the issues that have come to light at the time you are taping involving the bombs that have been sent around the country because their immediate issues involved as we're speaking we don't have a suspect in custody\nThere is a lot of investigation going on but we have had bombs that have shown up in different places targeting democratic political leaders and one that went to CNN\nThe question being is it's it's an attack on the media or is it not that CNN bomb and what do we think about the coverage in general well\nOne of the things that I thought it was so interesting on the CNN thing was\nWe know that Trump himself the president has been um basically agreeing with the ... at all of his rallies which is to CNN I Believe that CNN sucks and right that's what they say yeah and they do it by the thousands and so now when CNN gets that you have the president and his hypocritical Mike\nStanding up and saying we have to be nice to each other when he's been meeting these chains and talking about the press is the enemy of the people and setting up the stage\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire

deplorable coat you know what she actually said was\nThat she was trying to reach the other half of the right wing she said you know you can put half of Trump's supporters into what she calls the basket of deplorable ... that were never going to get them she was trying to encourage your supporters to reach out to the other half of them\nAnd of course that was blown up that Hillary Hillary Clinton considers all Republicans to the bathroom deplorable Donald Trump's that anybody who votes for a Democrat now is crazy so it's crazy a worst thing to say about half the American electorate than\nDeplorable ... being a reference to people with ... that you can't reach that reach out to everybody else I fear you'd have to protest too much and here's what I'm my problem is rex she shouldn't have said you're right politically it's unwise but substantively what the president says there's a lot worse than that everyday absolutely\nStreaming support for WAMC come from birch are

news listeners and the less of\nAn because a Democrat is leading in the race right and so the followers was I described before may be journalistic prostitutes and do what they have to do\nYeah yeah I thought that I Need a whole rethinking about how we turn to listen and the age of ... because we're following the rules and he's not following the rules I watched Twitter and I think\nNobody I really now as a real person actually reads Twitter they find out what the president says I'm trapped because then mass media mass reports it and even though I think we need to report when he says on Twitter I think that breathless leads about his tweets or when he says something wrong\nAll of us if we're in a newsroom and we had a source that was repeatedly St faults things at one point we would say you know we're not going to listen to him as much we're not going to give him ... I understand is president of the United states to\nGet in front of me he was a a regular source or re route tension you would really downplayed what\nThat's true you would do it at you basically say yeah that that creates yeah we get an email every day from a guy who's a former Albany high school principal every day he writes to us and we just basically it's like yeah yeah you just throw it off to side he doesn't have anything to say\nI got a postcard looked at every single day from a guy really day or every other day the post office or the ferry now that guy some of the\nMale we get in the roundtable panel I see a bomb on the mailing list I see it all and there there are several people who write every day whose whose comments never get on the air and rightly so but they keep writing but I don't know who they think is ... look\nAt how do we change journalistic standards to Judy's point how do you do that if if you're wacko the the unreliable sources the president of the United states\nBut something needs to be done to take a look every day at the two major tabloids in New York City\nThe daily news which hates Trump with a passion that serves no competitors and every headline is denigrate Trump I think quite properly and the New York post which is on the other side of the table and who you know just defends him known no matter what the rationale is there's no way to change that is their ex\n[noise] the tabloids are always just a case it I mean they're just a little bit of an exception but they have and you could say that from where you said it's very comfortable for you and you're a very respectable newspaper\nThose guys they have you know hundreds of thousands of of readers is still it's gotta be journalism well sure yeah journalism what was the question the question well who does the ... I don't [laughter]\nYou know he meaning drum has succeeded in systemically changing the way half of the country views the media and has a world view so much so that when Trump leaves office in however amount of time\nAnd no matter what the circumstances of and leaving often\nThe residue is going to be remaining behind and it's going to to I Believe it's going to take a generation at least if there is no counter bouncing\nFours to get us back on an even keel where people believe what it is being reported in the mainstream press the only other thing that I think that could change that short term and I hate to predict it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com and no choke nope ... dog harness invented to make it easier for both dogs and humans no need to pull no need to

factually what is going on now but I Know you're right\nYou know here's this guy comes from The Apprentice he comes from television he takes what he knows about how to turn it on a lot of people including some money and not all who are uneducated and who are in that basket that Hillary was talking about before and I don't think that's ever going to change now in other words that worldview that\nThat approach is now something we have and anybody who comes on from now on I was watching Joe Biden the other night and Joe Biden was employing a lot of the tactics in terms of is appealing to that crowd there that you would see from a Donald Trump you know that The Apprentice ratings eventually tank so [laughter]\n'cause I ... my point\nIs that I think journalism is respected at the local level and so I have hope that at the local radio station spoke a TV stations local reporters working for newspapers their readers do trust what makes you say sure you get some criticism from some of your readers listeners and any new ...\nNew [laughter] time but there is\nI think the locals do respect they appreciate what you do I I think\nHe's a little reporting that is that why I I Wish I could be as confident that I look I look at the responses on Facebook to stories of my newspaper prints\nAnd it's vile often it's right out of the Trump playbook often it's fake news in caps often even when it's your local ... well I mean I don't want to speak for the times you knew that this can actually use that\nAnd maybe this reflects negatively on my old newspaper but as long as I was at the daily Freeman going back forty five years we heard from the community that nobody would buy the paper if it wasn't for the comics\nThe police beat and the ... and so nobody I liked him in Iraq fish with yeah it was a we had a radio guy in town who used to call us to shed rapper and that was his nickname never mentioned the name of the paper we were the shed rent\nAnd then there was no more ... and they couldn't have and then and only died prematurely and what a shame [laughter] we wish him\nDo that but that's how I mean I I maybe you've heard this line before I've I've always grown up with a line that says nobody likes their local newspaper I can recall our newspaper going into the market Poughkeepsie Journal was serving and hearing from readers there's the boy we're glad you're here oh
