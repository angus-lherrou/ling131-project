[noise]\nYeah we all have a Media Project we will or when we're happy to be underway with you today I'm Rick Smith editor of the times union and we thank you for joining us here with me today Ira fest spelled publisher merits his men who long ago for a long time I should say ran the daily Freeman in Kingston New York\nLong ago in a faraway place\n[laughter] nuts so either way Judy Patrick of the New York press association formally editor of the daily gets that is connected ... yeah I'm always glad to be here well it's just wonderful to see\nWhy give it another view after the show's\nYeah yeah and see if you still feel that way kale and brown head of the department communication at the conditions\nWith S. at the college they rose how she is ready to communicate and ready to communicate you get communicating and we're the Media Project Allen is out as we tape so we will be making are we alone without ... let's see if we can give you some insight notwithstanding\nAs we look back over the last couple of weeks obviously the dominant a news has involved Supreme Court nomination of judge Kavanaugh\nAnd is really worth assessing how the media has handled this very controversial issue in which the nation's seems to be significantly divided two thirds of voters say this could be voting issue for them in the fall\nThere is seemingly a significant partisan divide on this and it seems if you look at the commentary on cable TV that there's been a divide in the way it's been handled so any general assessments of how this has has gone\nWell you know if we're going to judge amount and kinds of coverage based on what on cable TV we run the risk of forgetting what the rest of the media landscape is but because cable television is so dominant that it's hard to ignore it and as this typically the case with cable television\nWhether it's the story or whether it's a missing airliner or whether whatever the news of the day is\nThey're just gonna run with it all of the time perhaps understandably so because they have different programs on and not everybody was watching all the time but if you uh do nothing but watch cable news it's coming out of your ears and I believe but disproportionately cupboard\nYeah it's the mellow drama I think of cable news that distorts are frame of reference when we're dealing with is very important issue we don't look at the real issues at play here about women's role in society and people's reaction to sexual harassment allegations\nThe other thing I found really interesting is how the words people are using we're hearing the word accuser rather than a woman who's maintains that she's been the victim of sexual assault very\nGood point in so many instances we're being encourages journalists to use person first language like a person is not an addict it's a person rather we describe as someone in that situation is a person who has used drugs and that's very interesting instead of it\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThat short hand you could just as easily say a woman who said she was sexually assaulted right\nI Know that doesn't sit in a headline that might be more appropriate\nAnd it's important that we are thinking about the words that reporters and editors are using because those words which I'd say a lot matter\nThis conversation is reminding me and the Americans with Disabilities Act which was adopted back in the nineties\nAnd in reporting world we used to use a wheelchair bound when we talked about people who use wheelchairs but when the ADA came around then we changed the language to say someone who uses a wheelchair and the same person first kind of language so it seems like that's moving forward when the media is deciding how to name things\nUm and so this is now the norm for the addition of a orchestras are to have the players behind a screen\nSo it it would make sense that if you could give people a type or just um the can type in or or or video with a ... of milk Hi Ron let's say you can't tell the source a sea of you\nStreaming

were here would say\nI can always tell I can I can quote him 'cause I couldn't show so many years as we heard of it [laughter]\nYou know I felt where the story right right right and we all her different between\nThe New York times and the wall and the New York Post's of course of course you can I mean that that is the language is very different there it's not simply a matter of um the the political bias that it comes from but it is the the the nature of the way it's presented also\nUm but certainly there in the in the context are reporting the notion that readers and it's only makes sense we all bring to every experience we have of the the full range of our own experiences and so it would make sense that our biases would influence the way we see it but\nYou know but I think that that in part explains why the press has just trusted and why our favorability ratings are not high ... I mean I take a very benign example you all have\nA a examples of your own I can remember when I started out in sports and I would cover a football game between two local rivals and tried to write the story right up the middle I Would get feedback from both sides saying that I favored the other side when intent was to do not either but\nIf you go into reading that story with your by as being in favor of one side and your story doesn't match that bias\nThan it's the newspapers both era biased report\nNow as a former sports writer tell me this or are of it and it isn't it true that if you're a writing sports for about a home team you really need to have a bias in favor of the home team don't you don't your readers\nI guess the readers hated if you don't I Would contend that you shouldn't do it that way but I suspect of it the experience and most of the local reporters as\nHave is that they take the point of view of the home team but I I don't I Hope that that's less common then I think it is but I that was certainly not in my approach which is one of the reasons I always aided by both sides\n[laughter] when we when we're in the classroom when we talk about biased um we talk about\nFor instance birth order so are you I'm a first child the last child then only child a middle child\nThat influences how you make decisions because just for an example you know what faith were you raised in what's her face in your family was there no faith in your family all of that equates with the ... and when you're coming up reporter to be you don't even recognize sometimes that all of that has set into the decision to make about\nThis is the source I'm going to use first in my story this is a source I'm going to second someone has to be first to start the story air go you get a bias ...\nConclusion of the study they mentioned that uh have you had to actually consume higher quality news you can be less biased I Know that and and the higher quality news tends to be newspapers just ... death\n[laughter] and I think\nEverybody at this table or\nThey'll tell you I Am limited experience as a sports writer but when I was the editor of a small a newspaper rented a little county seat ten in the mid west there came a time we covered three different school districts and the two guys who ordinarily would be covering sports for occupied\nCovering the team in the north end of the team in the south and they were actually better than the home team from our communities I had to go cover the first game of the season underway game for the high school team of the Rensselaer, Indiana Central High school bombers\nAnd the bombers went off and they lost forty eight zip\nAnd I had to write about the home team losing forty eight tip and let me tell you every first down becomes a paragraph of its own Rensselaer threatened on\n[laughter] [laughter]\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nPlaying Poughkeepsie high school in ... when your local football reporter there most of the time has no press box of what you do is you want you walk along the sidelines taking your notes\nAnd the Kingston people thought I was a biased against Kingston so this particular game I walked the Poughkeepsie sideline Kingston ... ah fans were all the way on the other side of the field and Kingston scored a touchdown and one of the leather lungs who I knew from Kingston I could hear him across the field hey\nIra what'd you think of that [laughter] a life of a high school in the fall of\nBoy wouldn't want to have to do it All right let's talk about something that you don't see much of an immediate and see why that is that is there there are two things that I tell people we don't publish the times union\nFiction intentionally and poetry and now there's a good reason for this the time you publish a first a poem from a reader or you're going to a then be day loose with poetry and I do not feel qualified to judge what is good and what is not in terms of poetry\nAnd I you know we have a limited amount of space but I'm just wondering if um if maybe a little fiction wouldn't be a bad thing in terms of building reader interests I mean after all this out Charles Dickens has published\nExactly and it would be a way to keep people are getting into the habit of reading the newspaper it's something that\nWhen I went to the cause that we considered doing it the question is getting good quality content and making short comes every week but again there this has been a traditional newspapers back in the day they did run cereal kind of fiction pieces which really grabbed the attention the readers and boosted circulation\nAnd after all comics aren't I mean I hate to break into becoming true [laughter]\n\n[laughter] but the reason you're raising this is because there's a newspaper in Washington state that is running serialized fiction\nYes absolutely the inland under the inland are and they're they're paying a guy ten thousand dollars for a series that's going to run weekly for a whole year [noise]\nUm and uh it's a it looks like a great piece and I can I can almost imagine it and I'm just wondering if it might not be a worthwhile thing for us to consider or especially these days graphic novels you know this is a rowing genre which is really interesting that is kind of comic books for adults if you will\nUh and maybe that is something that we should consider and\nAre trying to reshape the role of the print media at least I don't know that we necessarily need fiction on the digital side of things but maybe this would be something that we build readership be interested to hear from her that folks media WAMC data orgy engine to hear what people think about that\nYeah well what is this going to cost us if we just decided to do it or we are we running excerpts from books to help sell a book and we get the content for a while or we actually\nTaking a reporter are hiring somebody to do this at the same time that we're not a hiring and in fact letting go people who are covering news so it's it's a determination that may have made more sense to me when when times were better than again when times are better you didn't need serialized content to sell newspapers\nAnd the other thing is you have to make sure you're really clearly labeled as fiction because people get confused especially on line you know that\nThe issue in student journalists they ask us could we run poetry or could we run section and we I I I'm the advisor to the school paper and I frequently say our space is too precious to place it somewhere else we have too many stories to cover too much serious stuff going on that needs time devoted to it\nTo spend time with poetry and fiction and the news\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nIt's a newspaper and if you you could compromise the credibility of the publication that's just my one concern though I Do agree with Judy I see value in creating reading habits and maybe getting some people and throws a fiction it's a tough call I don't envy an editor for having to make that cough\nAnd finally today we turn to the topic of the media access we've complained before about the access to the governor of New York and of course now or the president also President Trump actually conducted is first uh I think his forces since he was elected full scale press conference\nI'm a remarkable show it was while wasn't it though [laughter] but there is you know there used to be something called the daily a White House press briefing sometimes two a day which has gone away and they said ministry and sometimes there's only one press briefing a week\nAnd there seems to be a lack of availability organizations use organizations that are somewhat smaller like ours for example Hurst has Washington correspondence but we're not\nWe're not like the New York times or the networks always right there on the White House lawn the White House press briefing is often been valuable this administration simply isn't doing it you don't see Sarah Sanders up there every day that we use the the White House press secretary\nOf corruption
