I understand is president of the United states to\nGet in front of me with a a regular source or right ... you would really downplayed what had actually\nTrue you would you add that you basically say yeah that's just that great yeah we get an email every day from a guy who's a former Albany high school principal every day\nHe writes to us and we just basically said yeah yeah you just throw it off to side he doesn't have anything to say I got a postcard like that every single day from a guy rarely day or every other day the post office and he's very young\nGuy some of the male we get the roundtable panel ice field I'm On the mailing list I see it all and there there are several people who write every day whose whose comments never get on the air and rightly so but they keep writing better know who they think is really look\nThat how do we change journalistic standards to Judy's point how do you do that if if you're wacko the the unreliable sources the president of the United states\nRight but something needs to be done\nTo take a look every day at the two major tabloids in New York City\nThe daily news which hates Trump with a passion that says no competitors and every headliners denigrate Trump I think quite properly and the New York post which is on the other side of the table and who you know just defense him known no matter what the rationale is there's no way to change that is their ex\n[noise] the tablets are always just ... I mean they're just a little bit of an exception but they have and you could say that from where you said it's very comfortable for you guys very respectable newspaper\nWith those guys they have like you know hundreds of thousands of of readers is still it's gotta be journalism well sure yeah journalism what was the question the question is well the ... I don't know [laughter]\nYou know he meaning drum has succeeded\nIn systemically changing the way half of the country views the media and has a world view so much so that when Trump leaves office in however mount of time and no matter what the circumstances of him leaving often the residue is going to be remaining behind\nAnd it's going to to I Believe it's going to take a generation at least\nIf there is no counterbalance sing\nFor us to get us back on an even keel where people believe what it is being reported in the mainstream press the only other thing that I think that could change that short term\nAnd I hate to predicted or say it is some sort of a major disaster whether it's a terrorist attack of large scale proportions or five major hurricanes at the same time\nIt is some sort of a major disaster whether it's a terrorist attack of large scale proportions or five major hurricanes at the same time or the country all sits around the fireplace metaphorically and turns on their favorite media outlet to learn factually\nWhat is going on now but I you're right\nYou know here's this guy comes from The Apprentice he comes from television he takes what he knows about how to turn it on a lot of people including some money and not all who are uneducated and who are in that basket that Hillary was talking about before and I don't think that's ever going to change now in other words that world view that\nGot them Roach is now something we have and anybody who comes on from now on I was watching Joe Biden the other night and Joe Biden was employing a lot of the tactics intensive is appealing to that crowd there that you would see\nFrom a Donald Trump you know that The Apprentice ratings eventually tank so [laughter]\n'cause I live my point is that I think journalism is respected at the local level and so I have hope that at the local radio station spoke of TV stations local reporters working for newspapers their readers do ... what makes you say that I'm sure you get some criticism from some of your readers listeners and I think\nWe do that but you need time but there is\nI think the locals do respect they appreciate what you do I I think\nThe local reporting that ... I Wish I could be as confident\nThat I look I look at the responses on Facebook to stories that my newspaper prints and it's vile often it's right out of the Trump playbook often it's fake news in caps often\nEven when it's your local on alert warning of apps ... well\nI mean I don't want to speak to you for the times you knew that this can actually use that and maybe this reflects negatively on my old newspaper but as long as I was at the daily frame and\nGoing back forty five years we heard from the community that nobody would buy the paper if it wasn't for the comics\nThe police ... and the ... and so nobody likes him interrupt fish with yeah I was at ... we had a radio guy in town who used to call us to shed rapper and that was his nickname never mentioned the name of the ... we were the shed rent and then there was no more shed and they couldn't have happened and then ran an idle guided prematurely what a shame\n[laughter]\nWe wish him do that but that that's how I mean I I've maybe you've heard this line before I've I've always grown up with a line that says\nNobody likes their local newspaper I can recall our newspaper going into the market that keeps the journal was serving and hearing from readers there is a boy we're glad you're here we hate the tickets eternal and then we would have\nVice versa this another newspaper there Middletown or Poughkeepsie would come into our market why I'm Glad to see there's another paper in town because we ate so nobody loves their no clear local news\nYeah there's some of that by the way if you ... media WAMC dot ORG Alan ...
