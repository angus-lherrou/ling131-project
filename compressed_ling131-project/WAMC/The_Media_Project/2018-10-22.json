I'm a Bernie Sanders among others are giving spirited really too but I never see them made it appears that the mainstream media is falling into the same trap that they were twenty sixteen\nGiving Trump millions of dollars in free advertising while shutting out the Democrats have\nI think our listeners that's absolutely right we should not be providing so much coverage but the problem is\nIf something newsworthy happens the journalists need to be there to bear witness and share it with the people who are not in attendance or did not see the rally so we have an obligation to be there as journalists at the same time we don't want to give him all those millions of dollars that our listeners so rightly made mentioned not\nYes I totally agree and and not only is he getting free coverage by having the snippets of ridiculous things that he is saying repeated and repeated and the people behind him cheering him it inadvertently lens and Arab credibility and believe ability to the things that he is saying\nSome things that you're leaving some damage or not accurate you're saying correct [noise] damn I agree with both of my fellow panelist [noise]\nI hate to do that except I Would

ticked off number one\nThe Democrats the first time that I can remember are vastly out raising the money the rich Republicans are able to raise the number one number two I think that the energy level of the Democratic party is now so great\nThat we see registering sharing early voting the pollsters being all wrong and why are they all wrong because they can't figure out who's going to come out and vote\nYou know I live with somebody who wants to throw something into\nTelevision every time she sees Trump face on there and she yells out things like I hate you I'm hesitant [laughter] matter Allen does it does at the at the television while you multiply her by a couple of million and that might really affect\nThe fact that it's a journalist from those of us who have a deep interest in journalism we can see this is\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I Know choke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot\nCom and which one was the last thing he wrote about the ability for people to speak freely and the value of his ability to be able to speak freely\nBecause in many of these countries like Saudi Arabia and he wrote citizens are either ill informed or misinformed because there isn't freedom of the press and the absence of information is really what is the perils of democracy you can't have effective democracy if people are lied to\nOr if the press doesn't get access to information which is why going back to the arguments about our president which is why we need to be so aggressive about faring out his lives because that is what leads to the demise of democracy\nBut we know that his allies the Washington Post says I'm up to two thousand lives three thousand lives whatever it is worth more than ... so they do so what it says if water is falling off the ducks back\nThis is the new normal this is the way things are so why do you know who cares if this is not Allen speaking now Allen talking about what certain people particularly people in the Republican Party are saying\nThat first show he I really hope that the national media and local media to keep it alive don't bury the story there's so many crazy things that keep happening\nIn this administration and in the world we cover it and then we move onto the next thing and we kind of forget to stay on top of the horrible thing that they're trying to distract us from remembering and\nSort of all the topics that need to our ten times that it's hard\nNot a nice drank we have to keep telling readers keep telling listeners every day what still going on well you know and that's hard and that is hard to do\nYou know it's interesting it came out in the beginning and you got guys like Lindsey Graham on him I don't like and other people\nAnd they were making it clear Trump better not do this and not and not take this terrible murder and put it under the under the rug and then all of a sudden that chorus of Republican senatorial voices has become dissipated and muted and more and more muted now it's up\nTo the media that's where it comes into the media\nTo a point that out hey Lindsey Graham the first day you were irate how can we haven't heard so much irate in his lengthy\nYeah well you know I think his color as Mandela he folds it's a just kind of ridiculous he he always gives up after him huffing and puffing\nAre pointed an editorial on this topic was what we don't know is whether the president's silence on this topic you know Donald Trump suggesting maybe rogue agents were responsible for the killing of ... which term I don't think was his own I think that was put in to his head 'cause that's not telling Trump's words you would have said you'll bad but\nAh but a rogue agents perhaps did this he suggested and maybe that's because he has a financial stake in an area being or financial say have a big Sledge taken him certainly\nThey take him bragging about in during the election over money that he has been getting from the Saudis and they play it on the tape now he gets up and he lives again and he says I don't have any relationship where there any physical relationship with them at all\nWell then why do we not have sanctions I I'm not on our actions I'm not arguing and the point if the crown prince ordered a hit on a journalist who has a dissident there should be sanctioned by the United states\nAnd that's another good thing you know ... political but that's another good thing that's going on in the press has been able to take all of those pictures of the road guys who supposedly road guys who showed up and then they show pictures of them with their friends so it's really something so\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog ... dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com\nAnd one of them are one of their bloggers is a a very powerful lobby is named Ed Rogers he's chairman of the Bee Gees yard group which is a major loving from the posters told him if you don't drop Saudi Arabia as your client you will not be allowed to write for us anymore and that is I think until recently I give up that\nI think that is fascinating because the company for whom that's lobbyist works is making eighty thousand dollars a month from Saudi Arabia is ... and they've determined they would not take any more money from Saudi Arabia while this crisis is unveiling yet revealing about ... gallon\nBecause for so many decades we in the press have tried to say that we're going to present different points of view you can be coming from different places and now we're suddenly deciding which places you can represent who you can be affiliated with\nStill in this particular example I think it's an excellent move on the Washington Post part but I'm not sure but I see the issue because you can go more than one way on the table\nBut journalism is something about values certain values have to be representing your journalism and if the preservation of human life is not a value if you don't stand up and say we're not going to have anything to do with you if you are an associate of murderers\nWhich seems to be what is the case if you're an ally of Saudi Arabia in this case I think it's entirely appropriate for the Washington Post to do this so\nBut I uh anyway [laughter] interesting question about censorship and truly does and who gets hurt and who doesn't get hurt and who has the power to have access to audiences just like this program right here we have a big responsibility here what we're saying should matter and we should be very careful in our word choice and the ideas that were shooting to\nShare on this platform and boy I guess\nWhen I get it I was speaking at a public gathering at a civic event last week\nAnd the guy came to me and was attacking me over something that Rosemary our mail set on this program in January of twenty Seventeen\nAnd he actually then sent me a tape of it ah Rosemary had made some a negative comment about something that the president said in his state of the union address and this guy was attacking me for having not taken Rosemary to task when she was going through this long a piece that she was talking about so be careful because\nWe all have guilt by association of things that each other says\nOh no [laughter] I'm not responsible for and Allen says [laughter]\nOh well if you're just joining us the Media Project for Northeast Public radio I'm Rick Smith with Alan ... Caitlin brown and we thank you for joining us media at WAMC to orgy is how you can reach us\nBy so during the fund drive a withdrew or just a very big federally a lot of people go up and said the Media Project should be an hour I don't want [laughter] I don't want to start all over again let me just say [laughter] oh well\nWhat can you do we want to talk of just a little bit before where our time is up about college students a new poll says that the news media consumption study\nAlmost half of the college students polled said they lack confidence and their ability to discern real news from fake news and\nMedia right well as a Caitlin and I are both teachers in a me to buy the universities I Know that we both tried to teach that in our classes and one of the simplest things is what's the suffix on the Web site that you're using is that in dot com or or ... and ... you is it a ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no joke no poll dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog with love thousands of reviews at my dog harness dot com obvious thing of any do you for representing a college it is difficult\nSometimes what do you think\nWell I think that we are fortunate that we're working with journalism students primarily\nAlso I work with communication students and so they have a higher sensitivity I Do think there's some value to all curriculum having some sort of news and information literacy programs we've talked about this repeatedly\nIt's important for students from a young age to understand what is reliable and when it's not reliable information and anyone can teach that's in a classroom\nIt just requires an understanding of how information is gathered\nHow does research report it out collected synthesized put together and made to sound understandable for audiences actually and if you are a teacher\nListening to this and you want some materials at Stony Brook university you could go to a just Google Stony Brook\nAnd literacy you civic leaders leaders and you'll find it right exactly it's a National Center a news literacy is Tony ... university has actually guides for teaching newsletter see it's a really great things was set up do not hesitate\nAll right that is the end of our time for now imagine that because as Alan says it's not an hour show Ellen ... thank you for joining on the project\nI don't know [noise] and I got a lot of people I mean you\nBrought up is production of WAMC Northeast Public radio\nAllen shrunk talkers CEO WAMC 'cause we're married at the University of New York commentator columnist and author\nWreck Smith is editor of the times union came and brown is chair of the department of communication at the College of saint rose and barber Lombardo is a journalism professor at the university at Albany some former executive editor of Tokyo and Troy record\nYou can listen to our podcast the Media Project anytime at WAMC dot O.
