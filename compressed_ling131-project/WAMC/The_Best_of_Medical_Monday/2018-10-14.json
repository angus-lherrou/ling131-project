[noise]\nThat's a really good question um it currently has not been found to be effective to screen the whole population has incidence of al ... is quite low and so generally it's felt that the risk of screening the population is not worth it but that may change as a technology continue to improve\nSo is there are a genetic a history here in other words if your parents headed or do you have a better chance of getting it\nSo that's a really good question um I thought oh my God yes [laughter] some ... some of them are felt to be genetic but that is the uh the exception rather than the rule\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nDo not have a family history the only risk factor that we know for ... formation and enters I'm ruptured smoking\nBut we do see plenty of patients who have ... who've never smoked before were there other than you would like that or what is the smoke do we don't really know other than the fact that somehow it weakens the blood vessel wall ... more than normal and those in your thumbs are more likely to rupture okay\nWe're off to David in Canaan or I wouldn't count on your own\nBy us for lawyers or any relationship between the build up a plaque or narrowing of the coronary arteries with respect to narrowing of either the carotid the cerebral orders\nHi David yes uh absolutely and that's one of the things I really want to stress today is that the majority of strokes are preventable and their preventable by the same things that help prevent coronary artery disease which are uh exercise healthy diet [noise]\nTreatment of diabetes those things that can help prevent coronary artery disease can also help prevent carotid artery disease\nWhich is out of the same effect a it for the cerebral arteries as they do on the coronary arteries\nYes absolutely as well as aspirin\n... snakes along okay\nI just read a study that said came out and said that the the eighty one milligram aspirin was now it's somewhat in doubt I've taken one all my life so we know about that\nChurch so that sunny looked at patients who have no history of ah any heart disease and so I think certainly most doctors would continue to recommend daily aspirin for patients who have a history of heart disease or history of stroke\nBut that said he specifically looked at patients who have no other risk factors and found that the risks were higher than the benefits\nUm and the risk is bleeding my risk is bleeding usually GI bleeding ulcers learn so I think a larger study still needs to be done but it did question what we generally think is a safe medication for patients who have no risk factors will go to Maurice in Bennington\nLoosened thanks for taking my call I've been living in abdominal in years [noise] and I notice a\nTheory of expertise but I think probably answer my question [noise] it's been it four centimeters Steve we're\nGoing to monitor six months [noise] is sort of became necessary woe be sure sure sure [noise]\nHi Morris uh so my standing is that the surgery is similar to the procedures\nThat I Do in the brain meaning it's an end of asking their procedure and they're able to put a cap that are in the blood vessel to the blood vessel in the leg and then put another catheter up to where the the ... and then they're able to lay a stand\nIn the ... to help reconstruct the normal size of the blood vessel\nIs that I'm closer to nature that\nIt would be considered an do vascular surgery it would be done to hunter X ray guidance and it would be done inside the blood vessels\nWell thank you very much really push you\nGood luck I Hope you stay stable blurry\nOh you know my goal is to die with this thing [laughter] and I was an ideal or a rigid out by okay and\nNow on to the gym in mechanic real or given mechanical you're on\nYou were speaking just a few minutes ago\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of Berkshire health systems providing orthopedic services in the Berkshires including may go robotic surgery sports medicine and anterior hip surgery for one three for nine nine six six zero zero\nThe need for that however ah you're probably aware there's there's there's a company that does screenings a called a lifeline screenings yes\nAnd I have had a had gone through their screening I just went through it back in June and one of the things that they actually do is for is abdominal\nI'm ... I'm Sorry I just wonder if you could speak to the value of of um you know all that type of thing because it isn't covered by insurance and um but you know their their whole shtick is to uh\nYou know do screenings for for things that are have health impacts but that are are not necessarily covered by insurance\nSo sure I'm screening for abdominal a near them and certainly easier because it's just an ultrasound test which is certainly more affordable I'm so that is something that I think is becoming more popular but the MRI a or the seats yeah that would be required to screen for ... is much more expensive\nAnd the CPA does carry a small risk of radiation as well as I the contract administration and so I think until we're able to have a better technology or we are working on ultrasounds for the brain which maybe someday would be able to screen for ... um I think it's still going to remain in question\nJim okay and now on to Melissa in Woodstock okay Melissa you're on\nHigh um about a year ago it was discovered I had her for clay the un steel okay\nAnd um and from what I understand that's not common correct I'm In a a stent was put in and I feel much better\nThings are much better but I went for many years at least three to four years\nWithout knowing I had this happening and now that I'm recovered I can still left with some vertigo and stressors like humid heat as a stress if I exercise and get really heated up\nI feel vertigo so I'm Wondering like cannot be connected to the ... I guess that's what I'm asking\n... could you give us the name of the condition again ... steel is a condition where\nThe is basically steal the ... the arm is stealing the blood that should be going to the brain because there's some ... an artery and so the arm is trying to get her fusion and taking that blood away from the virtual artery which goes to the brain\nThat very clear knows the noses in this case I Know what it is in a back what is it in this case\nSo to notice here is narrowing of the blood vessel I usually do to plaque um and so are these the same symptoms you were having before you had the scent put in Melissa\nBut milder you know are not as often it seems to be centered around like I said around heat and my body being I'm a stressed with a humid hot day or with exercise\nAnd are you taking any aspirin\nI Am and I'm under treatment and I did go to my neurologist or cry and my core audience look OK there is some plaque and there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Best of Medical Monday", "city": "Albany", "day": "14"}
