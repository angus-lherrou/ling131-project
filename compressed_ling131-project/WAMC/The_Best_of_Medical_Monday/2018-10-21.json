A. R. T. for primary age related towel apathy and it's a relatively benign condition but it can be annoying and it's variable and it's in his presentation so some people don't notice it at all and other people it drives them nuts\nAt it it is very similar\nAnd overlaps with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease where they may be increasing word signing difficulties are the areas of the brain involved are within millimeters of each other between normal aging in Alzheimer's disease and so I'd say three to four times a day in my office with new patients\nI'm trying to decide if the patient I'm seeing a normal aging or part primary primary age related tell office the forests they have the early signs of all how do you do it is\nWhat we do is we look to see if their other brain networks involve the psychologist would call\nA those domains so if if somebody has other areas of brain function of the brain systems involved in it with silt toward Alzheimer's disease but if it remains pure\nLanguage disturbance or with word finding difficulties and with some memory glitches then it's likely to be normal age\nMary on a real fast come back the lines are getting lit up\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com I no ... no ... dog harness that did to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the ... since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com family I don't\nI don't know the answer to that but I don't think so I think a an addition to maybe a family or a half that may have a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease but ... but not inherited Alzheimer's disease but a risk factor\nOr you may also your family may also have a a this tendency towards a genetically towards word finding difficult thing ...\nOkay and now let's go to Tom in Catskills on ... you're on the air [noise]\nUh Hi Dr um my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and a fairly\nUm I'm\nClose to and she was diagnosed a she had an emergency room incident where she actually ... you know and I'm very curious if that incident might have been a trigger for Alzheimer's\nOr ... certainly any many things can be contributory to the development of Alzheimer's disease\nAnd are having an area a or an interval where you do not have sufficient oxygen to the brain\nCan trigger a memory difficulties the hippocampus region of the brain\n... which is where our time is disease begins in is the site of recent memory function or a has the cells the brain cells or neurons that are the most sensitive to hypocrisy here or reduced oxygen nation\nAnd so if there was the very earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease even if it was pre clinical\nAh putting an interval of decreased oxygen nation on top of that would be quite sufficient to trigger or trip for over\nHow would that affect or in terms of uh uh the rest of us and the family and our potential to get out of\nA ... at this point because she is older I'm In Alzheimer's disease is so frequent you would likely have the the normal risk when we come into to run yes thanks\nTom you're listening to the best of medical Monday WAMC remember this is a pre recorded program when did you hear numbers please do not call All right let's go now to\nMarie I in New Windsor okay Maria new into your car and go ahead\nI don't have a quick um my turned on how the Israeli Palestinian she doesn't get in shape and boy did he go to ... to orange time\nOkay so that's very interesting very good question which is once again just want to get it straight from myself your husband has a sleep apnea he doesn't use the machine and will that lead to old summers\nA sleep apnea can cause memory and cognitive difficulties because you don't get a rest will sleep at night and therefore during the day the brain is on rested its little foggy it's drowsy or no fall asleep quickly uh but since sleep\nAnd the quality of sleep and the character sleep are so important to brain function\nOr people with sleep apnea I Do have an additive\nRisk factor uh that can aggravate or their cognition a and is not a may may help contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from my dog harness dot com no ... no ... dog harness invented to make walks easier for both dogs and humans crafted in the Berkshires since two thousand six\nNo need to pull no need to tug walk your dog would love thousands of reviews at my dog ... dot com\nTo use and there are many people who just can't\nTolerate it you know or their part why thanks a lot Maria okay and now over to Heather in all the rage\nHi there thanks for taking my call my father has Alzheimer's he Seventy seven\nAnd a the symptoms had been coming on gradually probably for at least that for years [noise] um I have all kinds of questions but I'm going to keep it to the streets today I'm Melinda and address that are two pharmaceuticals that he's been prescribed a he stayed on the Mendez for\nMany many years um and and my dad I mean probably at least five if not more um nobody in the family including my mother Shawn any\nPositive effect to it um he did continue to decline um the\nThe neurologist said said you know it's not meant to make him better but it's going to slow the decline um\nI don't know how fast TB progressing without it but he he's really progressing fairly steadily I'm with or without them into so we have some questions about that and also side effects of them and I read can be you know confusion and offered balance and things like that that that my father certainly has and the second\nUm prescription Arafat is something that he tried he's tried to take it several different times and it gives him um I'll just be blunt it gives him terrible diarrhea and uh he can't tolerate it and\nHe taking it and I'm ... I don't know if there is an alternative\nWell first in terms of the hour so it's a gastrointestinal symptoms or fifty percent of the potential side effects one way to get around it is to use the trans drama patch as there is one for a drug called X salon or with a stigma and which is a calling us Joyce inhibitor just like Harris up\nAnd so he could use a a ... a ... law and order the stigma and patch what does that too um that what it does is the medication is absorbed right through the skin and therefore is diluted in the blood or\nAnd yes there's a possibility since the blood does days the gastrointestinal tract that people could potentially get gastrointestinal irritation but almost never\nSo uh whereas Harris up or is taken by mouth and it trans or goes right through the gastrointestinal tract and it has a greater propensity to irritated so do either of them work uh\nUh ... they do work they are FDA approved but believe me or if it's different from the sense of does it work for me today or what they do is they take a thousand or two thousand patients on the medication and a thousand or two thousand people who were on a placebo\nAnd they track those patients over time and they show that the people who were the group on on average did better statistically significant than those who weren't but ah they're all declining very a lot more gradually and the treatment group so you're you're not going to see a positive response", "show_name": "The Best of Medical Monday", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "21"}
