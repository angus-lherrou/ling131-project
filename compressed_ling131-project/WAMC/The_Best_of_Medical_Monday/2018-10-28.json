I Would take it and I know at least once a day I Would take it when I was going to you're not going to class and I wouldn't let\nMe just interject so you know I'm not a doctor or so I'm not gonna give you any specific uh\nAdvice about the methylphenidate but I'm\nIn general are Fifteen and a half as a typical time if someone is going to develop\nNarcolepsy for to show it where when I was training long ago\nIt was thought that you know please adolescence young adults but now there's more and more work to be showing that there are signs of narcolepsy even in children and they've been working six year olds eight year olds and so on we thought well okay we'll give her\nA family history the the suddenly raises a it's generally a Fifteen and a half it would be a similar set of studies and it's not right typically just an overnight study it's it's often a series of\nA four or five naps in the day called the multiple sleeve lazy test\nYou are listening to the best of medical Monday WAMC remember this is a pre recorded program when did you hear numbers please do not call we'll go to Bob and Orange County Bob\nYes Hi my question can a document is ten there'll be a case may for high school students can be coming to school later but say between eight and nine o'clock in the morning rather than the typical seven seven thirty eighth on their natural ... no not\nOnly is there a case made but there are states that are finally getting the message here and this is a big initiative and public health\nSo uh absolutely uh the the leaders sleep hours of adolescents have a biological basis and I'm explaining this to principals all the time in general all teenagers have that that tendency and then there are some people have it much more extremely and that's on a genetic basis as well\nSo yes and in fact there are school districts and people are thinking about this I'm Mary Karr Scott ... is a name to to look up she's you know spearheading initiative in this direction okay\nAnd now on to Jesse in Troy alright Jesse you're on\nHigh that state and local political question\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkshire orthopedic associates an affiliate of perks or

like a little weight I'm so every night on the bus I just want the honey closer to see a logical locked bet on kind of get to go as long as it's working for\nA yeah a lot of people do where you're not a problem another thing that people find helpful is the use of a white noise generator ... um you know a fan I'll do but you can also go fancy and get you know rain on the roof and all in the ocean waves and so on but the\nIdea that wouldn't work love lifestyle [laughter]\nThat that that will mask because they you know the more abrupt sounds and put a background against us and that can be helpful\nTo your friend your upbringing I mean for example I mean I grew up on Ninety sixth street in New York ... where the cross town bus which in the second gear 'em and fire trucks all the time and everything like that now there are only people that would drive crazy but\nWhen we go back to New York and sleeping in New York I think I'm home again it's so lovely to hear all of those sounds with me right to sleep what do you think ...\nThere have been studies also people live by air force and that yeah you know they they do acclimate the brain is always registering when there's a sound we can we can see something like a K conflict certain brain waves that can be eliciting so it's not as if we don't register the sound but\nBut the kind of noise that were completely destroy sleep you know one week can oftentimes be uh dealt with even you know weeks or months later [laughter]\nThat's so interesting 'cause in great band and we got a brain that comes through three or four times and I moved to a free and it makes a lot of noise and there are lots of houses right on the railroad tracks and you wonder how did they get through that right as they find your way\nProbably acclimate for some people such as our caller more sensitive\nJesse thanks okay and then sleep asks another story\nMy marriage was saved by sleep masks because um my wife likes to read and she would come to bed much later than mean\nYou see once we discovered asleep mask all was solved there you go so these are easy fixes there you go and and now on to mark in Salem Oregon mark your turn\nAround hello doctor I'm a person who has studied the Eighteenth and early nineteenth century and I have a comment and then a question or comment\nIs that the ... people on the Eighteenth century ... tended to sleep\nIn a slightly a lays position on the upper part of their body that's why the ... shark it wasn't because they were short a it was because they slept march not setting up but wind more\nUh like on a chase lounge or something mhm a measurement Franklin was a big believer in this or that\nThey had to periods asleep um we go to bed at a fairly early our\nYou know eight o'clock or when I got dark and they would sleep 'til like midnight and then they would get up and I'd actually go outside sometimes and creates we're neighbors have something to eat I'm used to ... outdoor facilities and then they would have what they called dead sleep which should be after that\nAnd so they have another four hour period is that something that you are familiar with or have any experience was\nYeah I'm just you know first and second sleep or a and this has been commented on and I think the the feeling in the field though that this was sort of a cultural phenomena of that time in ...\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Berkeley Center for weight loss surgery with a focus on life skills and support for a long term success with we've got struck me in gastric bypass surgery monthly seminars open to the public for one three three nine five seven five one zero to register\nBut there were some really ingenious I'm\nA experiments or or observations done by by a researcher Jerry Siegel he was studying or indigenous peoples in Africa and South America\nWith active watches and lo and behold these people who are one one of the tribes had didn't even have hearts they slept out\nOn blankets or they all three tribes had seven and a half hours of sleep on average in a in this one period kind of like modern society so\nIt seems like this Western Europe first and second sleep was more of an anomaly yeah\nBecause I find that more ... more or less ... I I find myself getting up like that one I Am and coming downstairs and having a little tiny bite to eat and getting back in bed and then I then I go on to my deep sleep right as just a\nThat could work and and I we just mentioned that\nThe thought now is that if you get say three hours of good sleep have a break and get say four hours of good sleep that's pretty much equal or to seven hours it's it's the quality of each minute of sleep that can be problematic if the sleeps not a good quality doesn't add up\nMark thank you I Will go to Judy in Lincoln Judy and begin you're on\nThe tuition is that when I get mad if I had a very hard [noise] like most nights and I helped me a break the\nProblems that night and I and I don't feel very tired and I don't feel like things I Can't sleep at night sometimes I got an entire night with snakes don't make any\nRight well I Do two things to say a upfront about Sunday nights are people who have a a work week starting Monday morning that's you know a fairly clear reason why you'd be a more agitated even if you're not expressly thinking about some assignment the next day\nThe other the other thing that happens for most people because our circadian clocks like to keep us up later and there's also a lot of socializing that goes on the weekend\nIs that we tend to drift later in the timing of our sleep on friday night and Saturday Night and our internal clocks love that direction so they would like to stay there and then all of a sudden on Sunday night you have to pull back\nAnd go to sleep because you have to be up early the next day and that could be a special problem so those two things that were\nFor truth will thank you and now to David knows their county Hi Dave\nHey fall or you know and I so far so good\nI go to sleep and I dream every night and I constantly dream every night sometimes I remember the dream sometimes I Do does that mean I'm In deep sleep or I Am fully asleep", "show_name": "The Best of Medical Monday", "year": "2018", "city": "Albany", "day": "28"}
