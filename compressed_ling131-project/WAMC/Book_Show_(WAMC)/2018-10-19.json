what she learns from witnessing that experience\nYeah in North Carolina uh she's trapped in an addict but can overlook this Friday festival over they have music and dancing and the culmination of lynching and I'm not lynchings generally happened in ... in the south in the nineteenth century no the twentieth century up but they weren't as entertainment you know you would\nYou have someone in

gays upon\nIn the in the fields um she has no agency and in South Carolina North Carolina she started dating back and and that's part of her I'm entering into her own identity of becoming a person [noise]\nWhat is her ... as you saw it in in writing the novel what did you want her ultimate goal to be what what did you want her to to feel was the the ultimate goal [noise]\nWell I mean I'm you know what would you leave she has one idea that a a freedom in the north it's maybe having a job in starting a family and being independent and of course all these different states she goes through a

of all these different adventurers um\n[noise] uh you know I've always I was always sort of right I was always writing to that moment I Know she'd end up in New York or Massachusetts or Canada or the west\nBut but the place and I don't want to sort of described it because it's you know the sort of the ending and run the endpoint of her or ... or journey um but I was always getting or is that emotional reckoning that occurs in the last couple of pages where she's taking and everything's just experienced and what you thought about the north before versus what the north actually is\nThere is also the narrative of the slave capture the the slave catcher who is trying to catch corps he tried to catch her mother and failed and then determined to to catch Cora who has been looking for\nGive
