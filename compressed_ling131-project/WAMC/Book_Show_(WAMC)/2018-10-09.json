an off the shelf edition of the book show in partnership with north drier bookstore in Manchester center Vermont and recorded before a live audience author historian and Pulitzer Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin latest work is leadership in turbulent times\nThe book chronicles a journey the four of our nation's President Abraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson through those history is good when it's worse questions of natural leadership ability versus developed ability the relationship between ambition or versus the on leadership growth\nAnd how leaders both perceive themselves and are perceived by others are bestsellers included Lyndon Johnson and the American dream no ordinary time\nFranklin an Eleanor Roosevelt the home front in World War two team of rivals and the bully pulpit it is a great pleasure to welcome Doris Kearns Goodwin to this week's bookshelf [noise]\nWhat a delightful\nThank you I'm Glad to be with you again to the ... trial and I noticed ah for we did for a team of rivals\nAnd for the bully pulpit and for a an for this book leadership in turbulent times so you've been at at work on this for a while what got you thinking about just this idea of leadership\nAnd I think what happened is that each time I finished one of my book so I finished FDR and went to link and I'd have to move off FDR's books out of my study go to link and then move Lincoln out to make room for teddy and I always felt a little guilty like I was leaving an old boyfriend behind\nSo I decided instead of finding some new guy this time I decided why don't I look at the four people as you mentioned and especially LBJ and civil rights and domestic stuff knowing the war in Vietnam would cut his legacy into but knowing what he did in that area\nAnd look at them through the lens of leadership when I was in graduate school we used to think about these big questions I may sound pretty nerdy but we go out at night and\nSay where does ambition come from does the men make the times is leadership born or is it made and I've been lecturing on leadership for the last couple of decades but without really looking at my people just from that point of view and I was out of college place one time and the kid raised his hand he said\nYou know you're talking about leadership and how people leave when they get to the White House but I'll never become one of them it's too far away it's remote there on Mount Rushmore there on the currency so I realized if I started with them when they were young when they first recognize themselves as leaders when they were still going to screw up\nThen maybe young people and other people just inspiring can be leaders could follow their journey it didn't seem already made before you know how it's going to end up so that's how I began and I learned so much about them when they were young that I didn't know\nOne of the fascinating things about the book though is is a warning about those early years and that no one is on the same time table right right as far as leadership and what we would consider great nose by the same token it's certainly becomes apparent very early on their watch\nKnow that's what's really interesting I think it's true for for other people as well as for these people at a certain moment they find their vocation\nUm they there's a saying by William James the philosopher he said that a certain point you reached that if you're lucky something tells you this is the real me this is the voice inside it says that Lincoln is is it's certain right away I mean when he's twenty three years old\nAnd he runs for office that first time and he has to put out of hand bill to say why he wants to have the job it's a state legislator and it's incredible already at the age of twenty three he's at everyone has his peculiar ambition\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nBy my fellow man and be worthy of there seemed to think of that when you're twenty three years old and then he says he knows that he's only been in the town for six months of new Salem\nThey may not vote for him and if so he won't be very much a grand because you've been so used to disappointment but then he makes it's amazing statement he says but I promise you I'm going to keep trying even if I fail in fact I think I'll Try five or six times\nAnd then if I keep failing it'll be who humiliating and I promise I Will try again I mean that's amazing so it showed that he had resilience from that first time and he's going in already with the desire to do something with ambition that's beyond himself teddy admits when he runs and twenty three\nThat he's just going in for the adventure somebody comes to them a political bond says why don't you run\nAnd he doesn't have any thought he said of helping other people but then through politics he begin to learn\nAbout decrepit tenements he learns about um child labor he's a police commissioner in New York and he sees what the slums or like at night and it was a soldier he's sharing is food and shelter with other soldiers and he develops empathy he develops that desire to help other people\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHit so loved being in the center of attention when he was a kid that he always wanted to be the center of attention when he was an adult so much so that they want it to be the baby at the baptism and the bride at the wedding and the corps at the funeral\nSo sometimes it's the drive to recreate what you've had for FDR that was partly true too\nBut somewhere along the line as I say the real transference has to take place between just that desire for oneself and I think that is true for any of his any field and then wanting to do something that will make other people's lives better expand their lives or allow you to do something that stands the test of time and that's the big change that happens\nSo we're talking about ... what about ego and maybe even going further the amount of of a ... right I mean you know everyone has ... there's a certain number one and then take it to\nTo have let's face it any person who thinks that they can run this country has a minute ago\nRight absolutely huge ego there's no question about that I think the real question is and and to just think they can be president United States that they can take that responsibility that people are gonna want them to do that\nI think the question though along the way is are they willing as they're going up that journey to acknowledge that they have limitations do they have humility\nUm do they have you know the ability to see when they're doing something that's wrong and grow from that experience 'cause ego is going to give them as well that was true of Teddy Roosevelt when he was in the state legislature he had this blistering language and it was constantly going against it enemies and it made huge headlines of New York they loved it\nBut then after a while he couldn't get anything done in the state legislature so we realized that he had risen like a rocket and he was falling like a rock and so we have to make himself less\nLess annoying to other people less irritating and less ego driven so I think that at some point that ego is oh it has to be you even Lincoln he'd somehow imagines that he's going to have a different life than he was shocking corn and and cutting rails\nAnd that takes a lot of ego to think I could be something different from what I Am you can't get there without it but then you have to be able to contain it as it goes along\nBut doesn't this from you go to what you're just talking about you mentioned it twice before in our conversation amount of empathy where okay you may have a healthy you go but then wife ... around a little bit\nAnd you're you're brought down and you you have an impasse excited to other people and to the airport because of what you have gone through\nThink it's maybe the most important quality in a leader in fact I think if I were to worry and we can talk about this later about what's happening in the country today now\nTeddy Roosevelt said that the way democracy would founder\nIs if people from different classes sections and races don't have any fellow feeling which was the same thing for empathy for the other people they feel the other people or the other something different from them and that's when things split apart that's when divides happened\nAnd I think if a leader is going to be able to reach over class or section or racial lines they have to be able to understand the other people's point of view and feel it and that's from experience or sometimes has developed in them from these experiences that they had that was so tough in life and it's somehow you're right it knocks you down like somebody said FDR\nHow can you deal with all the pressures of the presidency and he said if you spent two years trying to wiggle your big toe um or if you tried to climb up the stairs as he did one step at a time hoisting yourself up until you got to the top and then you were having a huge triumph a celebration for this little victory then you would have\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nThe officers of hers\nAs an example the ... a book about President Obama you'll get a ... I'm a first year and then I mean if you're I mean there you can see it each year of a of a vow it's taking its toll on on the person um\nBut but that that's part of it is and and I mean that's that's an understanding of the responsibility but you have as a leader\nIn fact I think the most important thing that a leader has to have in addition to assuming that responsibility is the ability to somehow in the midst of all that pressure\nTo reduce the anxiety to find time to relax and replenish their energy or else even if their facial things look like they've gotten older their energy their heart their mind has to keep strong and each one of my guys except for LBJ and and I he's always as I say the outlier\nThey would somehow able to find that time we were talking earlier before coming in here that we in our twenty four seven world field so many people we can't take time away we have to have our emails whether they have to have our cell phones with us\nThey understood what we maybe do not that unless you get away from the pressures you will not only aged physically but mentally so Lincoln actually went to the theater a hundred times during the civil war they he said when the lights went down and the Shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could forget the war that was raging\nAnd that was once too many on board [laughter] yes if you got Ninety nine time wise guy would have been [laughter] so anyway\nAnd his also he got enormous relief from his anxiety to my sense of humor\nI mean he was able in the middle of the worst cabinet meetings to tell a funny story and then everybody would relax for a few moments and he too would in fact when they were making the movie Lincoln I was able to persuade Daniel Day Lewis and Spielberg to use my favorite Lincoln story it had to do with the revolutionary war hero Ethan Allen\nWho went to England after the war is Lincoln tell the story and the English wanted to embarrass him because they were still mad by putting a huge picture of General George Washington and the only outhouse we'd have to encounter it sooner or later\nAnd they figured it'd be very upset about the indignity of George Washington and out but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and there's one thing in the George Washington Oh yes he said I think it was a perfectly appropriate place for what do you mean they said well he said there's nothing to make an Englishman faster than the site of General George [laughter]\nHow can you imagine if if he tells one of these stories and the middle of everything\nFor a few moments you'll laugh you said laughter with like what's going on sadness Teddy Roosevelt exercising two hours every afternoon every single afternoon a boxing match or wrestling game\nOr a favorite was a walk in Rock Creek park in the ... he made a rule you couldn't go around any optical 'cause he came to Iraq yet to climate if you came to practice you had to go down\nSo their stories of people falling by the wayside one after another of the best is a friendship Basset or who came in and sell cat so vast waiting to walk in the ... and they find themselves in the woods you can't keep up with Roosevelt they finally come to the stream\nIs just thank God it's over we'll go back and it's a judge in my ... and so the president on button his clothes and say it's an obstacle we can go around it so let's take off our clothes\nSo I Do for the honor of France took off my apparel\nHowever I left on my lap and the kid gloves it'd be most embarrassing if we met ladies on the other side and I didn't have my gloves\n[laughter] stories but Lyndon could\nRelax when I was with him and it's a ranch he had a pool and we would presumably go swimming in the pool but the pool was filled with floating um raft with flooding no pads and ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nMoment and he didn't want to go to the movies 'cause it would be too dark and he couldn't talk you know he didn't want to read a novel so it wait on him even more because he couldn't relax\nAnd that's just the mind always going right\nExactly exactly you just have to what Lincoln said as you have to change your mind to another channel of thought in order to be able to fully get some replenishing of energy\nWhen we vote in history are we're voting for leadership or we're voting for the person that we feel will be the best leader or is that too often left behind\nI think it's the most important thing we should be thinking about when we vote for a candidate and I think it is too often left behind in the old days when the party bosses chose the people you're really much voting for your party\nAnd even now you know you're voting for somebody in a debate who'd said something silly or ... voting for who has the most money who who represent certain issues that you may care about what you don't know whether he'll ever carry out those issues\nUnless you understand their temperament and their leadership you know are you somebody as we've talked about whatever they do have humility can you created team where you can share credit\nAnd you can shoulder blame for that team can you connect to the people emotionally um do you have a sense of being able to control your negative emotions think about these qualities that I mentioned right now I'm ... do you keep your word\nWe know all the people have come from somewhere before most of the time they'd come from another political office until this last situation\nUm but even with President Trump as a leader we could have seen what kind of leader was the what kind of team did he bill ... teams\nAnd you would know that about a governor and senator and if we could use that and that's the way journalists could cover candidates not just in a long magazine piece but how we talked about them temperament finally got raised in the last campaign at the end but it should be a ... a central quality I think we look at in our leaders\nBut under the new book is leadership in turbulent times it was published by Simon and
