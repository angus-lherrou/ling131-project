Will be kinder Trudeau has been drawing his comic strip for more than forty years he is one of the best he has iconic and then there's a great pleasure to welcome Garry Trudeau of\nThis [noise] how are you\nI'm good and and by the way it's more than more than forty years it's fifty years last August it's fifty or fifty years is when I came home from a summer job in Washington\nAnd had this idea and they went up to my bedroom and I knocked out a few strips and went back to school and it was a sports strip it was based on a\nA football team that was doing very well at my university and I took it into the unit to the managing editor and said what do you think and he said it's OK with us we run pretty much anything [noise]\nAnd they ran it for four weeks and or five weeks and I got a letter offering me my current job [noise] so I\nHave one of those narratives that my children can appreciate they hate mine um there's no ten thousand hours there's no there's no preparation there was just a serendipity a brand new syndicate was was a setting up and I was there for their first feature and I kept the lights on for the first five years or so\nOne of my favorite books of yours is the collection of the of the earliest comic strips from from when you were\nDoing the strip and yell it's phenomenal and obviously it it seems as though it's early work but it it's gives you such deaths to the characters that you created\nWell I [laughter] that's surprising to hear you say that because I think in the beginning I it wasn't his character driven as it became you know I was trying to create gags and and so that was that was about as as high as I was shooting in those early years as I was just trying to make people laugh\nYou're drawing these characters in depth and moving them through time and moving them through the ups and downs of of lives with something I just didn't imagine in fact I went on to to grad school and graphic design because I had no idea that this thing would have any kind of legs\nAnd no one was more surprised than I that as the years went by and twelve of them went by and I thought you know this isn't good to keep all of these characters a on a college campus I may be soccer but the rest of them really\nReally needed to really needed to move on and so I I've ... the strip and place and took took time off to work in the theater for a while when I came back moved them forward ah in in real time or all of them have\nKind of a different timelines some of the age more than others um I'm I'm I'm horribly inconsistent with that\nPart of the of the joy of doing a character driven a strip in more or less real time is\nIs you get to write about different parts of the times of life but also you you get to write about succeeding generations I'm alec students buried a the daughter of Mike Doonesbury has her own children now she became sort of front and center when she was in college and I realize\nDaughter of up Mike Doonesbury ... has her own children now she became sort of front and center when she was in college and I realized that what I was doing was\nI started focusing strip on characters who are in the act to becoming their in their late teens early twenties and that's the most dynamic time of life that's when changes are are\nAre most profoundly a felt and later remember there was something called the reminiscent bump\nIn psychology and end in memory studies\nWe everybody has the strongest memories from that time from from late adolescence in the early adulthood and not just because you're experiencing things for the first time\nThe tweets a role in Hadley so so I I was one of the early people who actually figured out how to my ... but I was so sick of it by the time I finished at it but the end of that one year I knocked off and then I resurrected him and for for for Trump I took an eight year hiatus [laughter]\nDo you feel\nBecause it seems this way that okay yes we're going through what we're going through but in some way it is a good for you creatively\nIt seems this way that okay yes we're going through what we're going through but in some way it is a good for you creatively do you feel like you're doing some of your\nBest work now I Hope so I mean the goal in my profession is you know it was always been\nKind of steady excellent now I just say that's the goal obviously you're going to fall short of it often\nI don't swing for the bleachers much I I just try to get it as as good as I can and and the amount of time that's available\nI let go a lot of work through the years that was just good enough people ask me but often what do I do and I don't have any ideas and I just thank them for not noticing because there have been many [noise]\nMany weeks when I had had no clue what to do and and the way that I put them together the stories together is is a little counter intuitive and haphazard I have a general idea of what the story arc is going to be\nBut I don't necessarily write them in order because the time pressure is such that if I can think of an idea that's halfway through the story All right and draw that first and then I'll have to reverse engineer to get it back to where the story starts\nJust because of the pressure of of of getting those six strips out the door on friday evening [noise]\nUm it's it's a crazy way to work but but I\nYou know you find the work that sushi temperamental only and I I think of myself as as kind of a a a naturally lazy person and of course my whole family thinks\nI'm a I'm a workaholic and that's because I chose a a a profession where there was just no choice you just had to get a certain amount of work done in a certain amount of time\nAnd that turned into a career\nIn doing the and doing the the strip and creating these these iconic characters I mean we grew up with these characters you grow up with these ... yeah I mean that's\nA lovely thing to have I mean we're proud of our families and you've created expand well the big families of big sprawling family there about Seventy five characters that we have map you know we created a big key to all the characters for\nAn anthology just to help people out it's kind of if you haven't been reading the script through the years it it's kinda like opening a Russian novel in the middle and and expecting to make sense of it but but\nYou know I've ... I've ... I've always felt that if you if you are creating characters with enough enough ah specificity and care that if you got the details right that they would become sticky ultimately not that's not true of all of them there's there's dozens characters I've I've left behind\nBut for the most part the ones that that anyone remembers you know certain traits will emerge and when I worked in in\nIn in a TV years ago I did a show with Robert ... Tanner eighty or eighty eight and we did a sequel uh twelve years later for Sundance but in the first in the in the second one um Allman was famous for I'm pretty much ignoring the script\nAnd that's a little rough on a writer especially if you write with you know I mean for me every comic counts because there's so little space to work and\nAnd um there was one day where I\nIs seen there's no way you could have shot and we were in a restaurant and I'm In New York and with it and it's a ten character scene and so he just basically did what he wanted to do and when it was over he could see me sort of sitting gloom ally in a in a in a corner\nI'm I've been listening to the phones all day in vain for a word I've written\nAnd he came over he sat and I said sure why you write and I said and not so much today Bob and he said you right so the characters and know who they are\nAnd what he meant by that was if if the characters were were\nSo the characters and know who they are and what he meant by that was if if the characters were were\nWere you know nuanced and carefully conceived that that gave the actor\nEnough to follow him wherever he wanted to go and he was kind of a pipe piper\nWith actors they you know they just threw up their hands and just did what he asked because if they knew that he had their back they were never going to you know look ridiculous and less it was intentional um and that's a ... they just trusted him so\nYou know when we did the second when we did the ... the uh the last episode of that are that sequel and Cynthia Nixon was the star of the second one and and she gives this wonderful speech at the end and and a friend of mine said you know that's in the ... speech that was great\nAnd that was a nice piece of writing and said yeah well you know a Cynthia Nixon actually wrote it um [noise]\nBut as you know as a resource full an actress is she is she couldn't have done it had she not known who she was so\nThat was that's how I held on to my pride but but it but it you know writing this stuff is good training for that it's it's you know be careful as you create them don't just create archetypes I mean that's what I did in the beginning 'cause I didn't you know I had didn't have any experience with it\nBut you know create people that you know or understand are that are interesting in some way and um I think that that gives me an advantage as a satirist\nWhen I'm trying to you know deal with the current era is that I I can bounce all this stuff off my characters in a way that you know somebody who's just writing jokes can't what\nGives you solace when we have a rough day like Kavanaugh uh I've just come back from um I'm a two week road trip I'm a real road trip got a car like\nYou know my closest friend um we both had had this big birthday Seventy and so we done this when we turned sixty we we uh\nGot a car in Bozeman, Montana and came down to the national parks Yellowstone through Park City where my sister lives arches in Zion and and um all the way down to El Paso Carlsbad Caverns [noise]\nThat was extraordinary for me it from a therapeutic a standpoint you look at it that had monuments standing in the middle of Kenyans that are that are four hundred million years old\nAnd I'm geology just restores perspective and I'll tell you something else the other thing that really impress me our fellow visitors whenever we would pull over to a you know a vista to overlook a canyon or you know a forest or a meadow\nAnd there were other visitors they're\nAlmost without exception every single person we encountered\nSpoke in hushed tones like this when spring reverential\nIt was like I put the off back into awesome word that has a has lost its meaning in the last Twenty years it's some things so much grander than you are so much more you know it's not permanent but feels that when you're looking at it\nAnd there was something about the respect that people from all walks of life from all around the world felt in the presence of such rancher that just took took your bathroom way\nMust have been a beautiful trip especially to see it before the oil well start peering I mean we we did go through one monument that have been the listed um and there was you know a a great outcry in that community they were they they were not happy\nAnd where did you talk to people in that sense of sort of get a sense of people on the road or wasn't there not and I don't really I politics now it's all you don't want to do that what's next for you\nThe people in the sense of sort of get a sense of people on the road there wasn't a not certainly politics now it's all you don't want to do what's next for you\nWell hum as as I indicated earlier I I I Hope to do this as long as there are newspapers which is the kind of an open question I'm there we've lost an awful lot of them and in the last Fifteen Years or so you know I'll miss that I'm a this afternoon I was discussing with a a a colleague\nHum how this we feel like we're at the tail end of the greats a\nHundred and ten a hundred and twenty year cultural moment in which comics played a an outsized role in popular culture I mean if you look at the twenties and thirties they were at the very top along with jazz and talkies\nEverybody knew what every character was doing in every strip and it was it was part of our common cultural experience that's been a long time since that's been the case but you have this disgrace strip little limos and yellow kid back at the turn of the century\nAt one end and the book and I think is probably Calvin and Hobbes and far side and I'm I'm I'm not sure there's much of a future\nI certainly encourage young cartoon as these days who who typically if they have um artistic skills and in addition to writing skills that they did they go to fix our I don't see it happening on the Web I don't see comic strips really taking off their\nThey seemed to have you know coexist did with the right technology producing mass and newspapers for this wondered this century period and um and we're on to something else and you know our children and grandchildren will figure that out\nVery sure does new book is
