I think the easiest way to put it is is that we thought that\nWhen we started doing it we wouldn't maybe have to keep doing it but alas we do and maybe even things would get better but alas they have not a one eight hundred three two three nine to six to actually we keep\nBuying up these carpets if it gets and people keep polluting so we have to buy up more coverage defected right\nSo the ah you'll recall on a on Sunday or that the president of the United states was on sixty minutes and\nHe said that he didn't think it was a hoax but he he uh but he didn't know that it was it if it was man made and uh he also said that it it will probably just take care of itself\nOkay so now by the way this is ... is he saying this he's\nReady to go see the hurricane damage hum\nStreaming support for WAMC come from Tom ... what's the warmth in homes and businesses throughout the northeast today's self stoking automated would heat would boilers dot com\nSo I'm now he's long held this clean the global warming is a host he made a several new assertions and supported by science on Sunday I\nHere's a run down to the president's first extensive comments on climate change since hurricane Michael ripped through the Florida Panhandle in the United nations warned that time is running out to stave off the worst consequences of rising temperatures now the\nThe the the United nations the rest of the world said oh guess what you're screwed that's what they said that was what they said in the report it was it was to where you're screwed [noise]\nUm they have a a he wants to tell a Wellesley so I'm not denying that climate change but it could very well go back well now there is no science to to substantiate the fact that climate change could reverse itself\nBut okay um we do know that two thousand and Seventeen was one of the hottest year on record and that was without El Nino or any other um a weird weather pattern [noise]\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on climate change weren't last week that the world would see even more dangerous conditions including food shortages by twenty forty worried twenty eighth team now so that's an twenty two years\nHow old are your children that's right so All right cause those conditions go back as Trump suggested in the national climate assessment report on science approved by the White House in November top federal scientists found unequivocally that they will not\nAll right um the uh I don't think that there is a hoax I Do think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade\nUh he went on to say that um he questions the scientists because uh because they have a political agenda um look scientists also have a political agenda now um there's no doubt about it that a climate change has become politicized\nBut the sciences and science the temperatures are the temperatures right I mean I don't I don't so I'm now a climate scientist\nAt Texas Tech university says the thermometer isn't a Democrat or Republican [laughter]\nIt doesn't give us a different answer depending on how we vote okay now for the sobering stuff\nAre you ready ready oh God oh All right so the Trump Administration and September announced that it would replace the Obama administration's clean Power Plan with Trump's so called affordable clean energy rule\nThe Obama's clean Power Plan would have required a significant thirty two percent cut in carbon dioxide from power plants nationwide by twenty thirty remember\nTwenty forty of the year they're all hell breaks place it would also cut acid rain and smog by contrast the Trump plan now so the Obama plan that was implemented would have cut it by thirty two percent okay the Trump plan\nAchieves cuts in less than two percent okay\nFar too little to avert calamity\nHere in the northeast we any other states meeting New York and eight other states are doing irresponsible thing they are uh because of this greenhouse regional greenhouse gas initiative there on the track to make power plant carbon reduction similar to the Obama plan so they are\nPretty much proving that you can fight climate change and grow the economy at the same time so this regional greenhouse gas initiative\nIs the nation's first government run carbon reduction program for power plants it requires power plants from Maine\nStreaming support for WAMC come from ...
