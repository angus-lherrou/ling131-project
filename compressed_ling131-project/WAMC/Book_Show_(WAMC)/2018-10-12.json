so it's a really interesting thing to see them but then they're going to have swelled heads they're gonna do badly they're going to confuse are going to make mistakes and you don't know that they're going to become what they become until much later\nSo it is ultimately leadership emerge from good politicians versus politics human good leaders\nDon't know I mean that's a really good question I mean I think what politics does is to expose them to a large number of people that's why you know one of the things that saddened me about the twenty sixteen election was that political experience what's considered a liability rather than a strain but for someone like Teddy Roosevelt or Franklin all of them actually\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family

in politics is done right and you begin to identify with them and understand them and I think that's what makes you a deeper leader then you were at the beginning\nAbraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt and women Johnson so\nI'll ask about why those four specific would've been obviously a little bit before you have the drug store and my\nGuys I lifted or God you know after a while when you live with these guys you feel like you're waking up with them in the morning you're going to sleep not going to sleep with them you're thinking about that when you go to sleep at night\nAnd and you feel like this is why am I doing this I'm spending my whole life with dead presidents and then I realized it wouldn't change it for anything in the world my only fear has always been that in the afterlife is going to be a panel of all these guys that I started\nAt every single one will tell me every single thing I got wrong about that more than I mess and the first person to scream at will be Lyndon Johnson how come that down book on the Kennedys were twice as long as the book you wrote about me [laughter]\n\nIf you will get a juice from historical perspective I guess the the one thing that doesn't belong on that court would would be drawn some maybe although you make a very good case for among those\nWell clearly I knew to Lyndon Johnson so I probably wouldn't have been a presidential historian without having worked for him so I did have that personal relationship with him and threw that relationship I help them in the last year of his presidency and that helps them on his memoirs with living with him ... times down at the ranch\nAnd I came to understand that however the war would always always tear apart everything he had done what he did domestically was extraordinary and in those last year all he was hoping that maybe he'd be remembered for civil rights\nAnd I think of the accumulation of what the great society programs meant he meant that he didn't belong in that same category as embodied belong to be analyzed and to figure out why he was so successful in one area\nAnd perhaps not in the other but think about it three great civil rights laws ending segregation in the south providing that right to vote to African Americans fair housing Medicare Medicaid PBS headstart NPR\nImmigration reform war on poverty it's extraordinary any one of those landmark laws would have made a presidential legacy\nSo I wanted to understand how he was able to do it especially in today's world how did he get Republicans and Democrats to go together and the Congress we needed so badly right now\nHow much of that is um is ingrained to think when I when we think of of leadership as you say as they come they they make all kinds of metrics um all kinds of horrible things on them and these are not perfect mom\nAnd yet when it comes to leadership and different types of leadership but so\nYou know just exploring this I think there are certain leadership qualities that are in born I mean for some reason with Lincoln I think he was born with empathy he just even as a little kid when there would be other kids that were putting hot coals on turtles to make them ... he was going to say this is wrong he felt the pain in some way\nAnd he obviously was born with a gift for language\nI'm with Teddy Roosevelt he was born with a photographic memory and with enormous curiosity\nFDR was bought gifted with this natural optimistic temperament a confident optimistic temperament and there'll be J just had unfounded energy but for the most part they all made themselves leaders and Teddy Roosevelt wrote an essay wants two kinds of success one who has natural talent that no one else can compete with like a great poet perhaps or even a link\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nHard sustained work develop whatever talents they have to extraordinary degree through the application of work\nBut then what they all went through that I think made them better leaders is they they all went through terrible adversity from what I've understood even about leadership as as Hemingway said once everyone has broken by life but after with some people are stronger in the broken places\nAnd that happened to my four guys Lincoln had a near suicidal depression when he was in the state legislature and he hadn't been able to deliver on a promise to its constituents and he thought his word was the chief gem of his character and he'd also broken up as engagement with Mary Todd we'd broken his word to her\nAnd it made him it's so sad but they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and it's best friend came to aside and said Lincoln you must rally or you will die\nAnd he said I Know that and I just assumed die right now but I'm not yet accomplished anything to make any human being remembered that I have lived amazingly right that he can think that way when it comes out of the depression finishes the state legislature and then eventually gets a single term in Congress runs twice for the Senate loses twice and then when that runs is a dark with candidate for the presidency but\nHaving been through that adversity when the war came he was used to that knowing how strengths and resilience would somehow get him and the north through\nAnd then Teddy Roosevelt is in the state legislature and he is word that his young wife has given birth to their child is cigars go all around he gets a telegram\nThen a second telegram comes our later saying your wife is dying and your mother is dying to you must come home at once and his wife was in childbirth the mother was forty nine she'd come to take care of the wife she got typhoid fever he got home and time for her to die\nAnd then twelve hours later his wife died in childbirth\nAnd so depressed which he that he left the state legislature and he went to the badlands but he later said that experience of living two years in the west changed too he was with the best educational asset he ever had he became a Westerner as well as an Easterner he understood that the land and the nature which became has great conservation his legacy\nAnd then of course FDR had his polio I mean he was an interesting character before that but it's deep and his empathy and his feelings about other people\nUm when he's set up that rehabilitation center at Warm Springs he showed his vulnerability to the other patients they would swim together in this giant pool but he taught them not simply physical exercise\nBut he taught them how to get joy in life again they'd have water polo and tag or where they would um have dances at night and they're wheelchair that have cocktail parties and they said they finally learned that there could be joy in life again so he began to identify with other people to fade had dealt an unkind hand\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson of course he was always sort of the outlier he has a Senate lots of Nineteen forty one which shouldn't be on the power of these other huge losses\nUm but he felt it was a repudiation of himself\nAnd he goes into a depression but he goes in the opposite direction he loses some of the new deal is um that had started him into politics and the first place he becomes more conservative he goes after wealth and power\nAnd it's not until Nineteen fifty five when he was majority leader of the Senate\nAnd he's very powerful but he has a massive heart attack and then he asked himself that same question Lincoln did in a way\nWhat if I died now what would I be remembered for and then he gets civil rights through the Senate and then he comes into the presidency and that desire for his ambition to be something larger than us themselves takes root in the great society in the civil rights law so they all go through that and\nAnd that was really I hadn't thought about all those things until I was exploring this\nKearns Goodwin shows are just almost ... new book is ...\nStreaming support for WAMC comes from Albany med now open the mastery family children's emergency center a place for ill and injured children more information at AMC dot edu\nShip how do they work for your\nAmbition as huge as our president might say\nI'm ... without ambition the drive for its success I don't think any of us can get anywhere it's still a mystery wearing the mission comes from and people\nI mean whether or not it's it's a situation\nThat's in that's difficult in your family or whether you're trying to best somebody else or whether or not you've been privileged and you just want to recreate that privilege\nI mean they said about Teddy Roosevelt that he had so loved being in the center of attention when he was a kid that he always wanted to be the center of attention when he was an adult so much so that they want it to be the baby at the baptism and the bride at the wedding and the corps at the funeral\nSo I'm Talking to the drive to recreate what you've had for FDR that was partly true too but somewhere along the line as I say the real transference has to take place between just that desire for oneself and I think that is true for any of his any field\nAnd then wanting to do something that will make other people's lives better expand their lives or allow you to do something that stands the test of time and that's the big change that happened\nSo we're talking about ... what about ego and maybe even going further them out of of a ... right I mean you know everyone has ... there's a certain number one and then to take to\nTo have let's face it any person who thinks that they can run this country has to go\nRight absolutely huge ego there's no question about that I think the real question is and and just think they can be president United States that they can take that responsibility that people are gonna want them to do that", "show_name":
