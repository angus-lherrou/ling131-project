are afraid to say anything Kelsey because they know the backlash that's going to come is going to be tremendous especially people in power who were afraid of the of the social justice warriors and the mob comes after them if they say anything when women you know read your article I'm sure you've got several you know as much as you got complaints I'm sure there are women\nLike look I wouldn't say it out loud but I agree with you we need evidence\nAnd yes I did you know I received several direct messages through social media for women and even some men that they were survivors and that they agree with me that they they thanked me for saying what I did say afraid to which\nThat's just ridiculous that you would feel afraid that you know be factual but um yeah they they said that they that they agree that this is Chrissie of the last show that they don't really care about when that are survivors they just want to use survivors who agree with their bias as political pawns to further their agenda and I think it's disgusting\nOr talking to a a ... a ... and her her op ed pieces where we put up on our Facebook page I Am a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it when it happened to you you talk about the regrets you have I'm not saying anything\nAh back in the day and and you can you can empathize with her and why she didn't say that she didn't want to get in trouble she was underage drinking all of the guilt of as if she did something wrong yes she did something wrong to put herself in that place because she should've been underage drinking and at the same time that that was that kind of issue you had how did you deal with it\nAnd at the time\nIt kind of used her her rationalization the same way that she said she went through it's like I just should pretend it didn't happen I don't think anyone's going to believe me I'm you know because I was drinking and all that and and the couple of people that I did tell at the time just kind of encourage me not to not to tell and I think you know looking back I think that was because I told my friends and you know they didn't want this man ...\nStop buying alcohol for their party so I think that's another reason I was discouraged from coming forward and that is a regret that I had you know but\nBut like my article says I I'm thankful that I Can't still today go into a courtroom and accuse Amanda what doing what he did fourteen years ago and have them you know ruin his reputation or face any legal consequences based on just my word alone I don't think anybody wants to live in a society like that where we can just destroy each other's lives with accusations\nWhat did you think of ... of the way that he came out I mean I was disappointed that he went with the Clinton thing in a bit of The Revenge and stuff but at the same time I wasn't upset with the fact that he was angry because I think if any man you know people say well it was a job interview well um it was the last time you went to a job interview and the people across the table or interview and go hey by the way are you a serial rapist\nOh exactly yeah I thought I think it's nonsense with people you know they're they're kind of [laughter] they're deflecting send it to his mannerisms and how we act it because they don't really have anything else to accuse them out of the earth you know to run with on this ... been disproven by ... yeah exactly if if anyone had been accused of the things that he'd been accused of\n... anybody would be mad and I think it would be more odd if he were not bad I mean this man has\nBeen just put through the ringer and his whole poor family I mean at this whole thing is ridiculous and like you said you know at the end of the day after all this he's probably not even going to be able to coach again or teach again these things that he loves to do all because some woman just said something I mean that's just it's just so crazy I Can't believe the reality that we're living in\nWhat do you think we should go from here I mean as a ... and this is so much because I mean you know uh you've been through stuff a lot of people have been through stuff and and I've always said look\nSome people in life to go through horrific things and it's like you know it's like water off the ducks back and some people go through stuff that seems trivial a minor or or or it's a big deal but it stays with them forever and I think this was you know one of those things like if you're talking to people out there who've gone through stuff\n... what's the advice you can give them because I think you know judging by what I've read and and talking to you I I you know I think you cope with a rather well where I think a lot of people other people haven't\nYet you know it is hard and I think a lot of um a lot of change can come out just by having a conversation I Know a lot of the messages I've gotten so far from other survivors or just people who message me to argue it it's like you just have to remind them to look at things objectively\nYou know I'm so sorry for what happened to you and you didn't deserve it but that doesn't mean that Kavanaugh is your attacker or is equal to your attacker like you have to look at each\nYou know as a case by case basis that it does matter and you know when you're accusing someone if something that you know maybe you might have or you might have a right to be believed you know in a room with a therapist or among your circle of family and friends but you don't have a right to be believed in a court of law or you know when you're making this public accusations\nThe way that Dr Ford did you don't have the right to just be blindly believe you have to have some proof and I know that might sound harsh but it's just that's reality that's just realistic\nYou know one of the evidence that protects us to\nDo something I talked about which is I think a lot of women out there who didn't say something looked at Kavanaugh and said\nEssentially they they they they she propose them in their life as he's the attacker and this is my way of getting even at the person who did something to me and he's the one that we're going to make as the giant rapist of of all these people he didn't have a chance to get back\nOf their attacker right absolutely\nAnd I'm not either just he was just kind of that the man's who to blame you know the that because maybe they let they didn't come forward and their attacker got away you know innocent and got away free so let's make this man pay for it for what this woman says he did to her absolutely I think there's a lot of that\nThey're very very interesting a great article I appreciate you coming on today it's called I Am an actual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for word a Kelsey curtain I just thank you so very much into an and maybe we'll talk again about something more pleasant in the future\n[laughter] that would be great\nThank you ... shows your Twitter ca JD B. E. N.

I Would never put Pat Buchanan offer anyone except the president and I know he understands that have\nBeen put off by presidents before [laughter]\nAll right in\nThe interview I guess she's been talking to a king Saudi Arabia\nYeah I mean we have to get into this show the situation I I again he walks into a a a\nIts consulate in Turkey and he doesn't come out okay so looks like something happened got chopped up or something I we we don't know what happened but of course he um he ... he wrote a column in Saudi on Arab newspaper that was canceled\nYou know the guys you know marriage was collapsing at one point and you know he now he's he's an Islamic even though in New York Times today said look the guys and Islam asked\nBut also had a path royal service now doesn't mean you should be obviously should be killed but there are people out there seem to want us to go to war over a person you know like the person being killed or snuffed out in someone else's conflict I mean how is how does that make any sense pat\nWell really vicious vicious a classic case the question of morality persisted interest or ... years I mean from everything we know choking went in there they brought in a forensic expert from Saudi Arabia where the bone saw\nThat it didn't come out in your head Fifteen guys going onto planes are coming out the same day and the Turks have a lot of tapes in videos claim and we've got some information the prince of Saudi Arabia was trying to lure him back\nTo Saudi Arabia for some but not for some purpose [noise] show but the key thing here is you've got the prince of Saudi Arabia crown prince and the king put the credibility of Saudi Arabia on the line but they did not do this and you've got to America is checking it out\nAt the same time as this looks like a real ... in a moral ... at the same time they're very serious state interest\nSame time as this looks like a real atrocity in a moral atrocity at the same time they're very serious state interests and us relations with Saudi Arabia so you got to balance those things out\nYou know I remember you know Richard Nixon and we're over there and try to toast and Mao tse dong it the same time they're going through the massacres with a great role a tour and cultural revolution\nBecause we needed to deal with the Chinese against the Russians and the Cold War it's a real conflict here between morality in state interest\nAnd it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out\nBut it's undeniable that Donald Trump believes he is acting in the best interest cold national interests of the United states\nMarco Rubio a someone who you know it's much more of a neo conservative a bill or find Russia\nAh on occasion with other Republican vilify Mitt just ... you know I think acts like Russia's in sometimes be a bigger threat than it is even though he's been fantastic actually lately on China Rubio has been great this is what he said about Saudi Arabia yesterday\nWe've already asked for a magnet the investigation which means individuals responsible for that decision will be sanctioned beyond that there are other options that we can take I said that's something that needs to be thought through carefully but it needs to be very strong and meaningful can be symbolic it can't just be words\nYou realize that I Do agree with mark ... excuse me Senator Rubio to this extent or you can't just brush this well\nIf if the investigation points to the crown prince and the crown prince I don't know how you make the future leader of Saudi Arabia persona non grata and impose sanctions on him personally say he can't come to the United states and she uses bank accounts or something like that she got a real conundrum here so I think what's going to happen\nIs the the Saudis are not working with the Turks and the Turks a lot of countries over there in the middle east to have a real vested interest and not having a breach between Saudi Arabia and the United states so down ... you're going to see these\nInterests of ours against the sort of a moral decision you gotta take which is this is an outrage it can't be allowed to happen and it's got to be punished by sanctions at least against the individual someone suggested it to the solution is going to be the inevitable road agents went and did something they weren't supposed to do\n... and they wanted to give the crown prince viability\nRight I mean I mean this is ... and ... ...\nExactly and over again you know when I was running against are considering running against George W.

it's a conflict between the state and between ... and the state and morality\nWell and just another fact then we'll move on pat shaggy um we talked about this are touched on this last week was an acquaintance some bin Laden I'm going back decades and that was the problem is there a\nBig family in Saudi Arabia right yeah\nSo that's the big you know claim to fame and he on Twitter at other as well\nExactly and after his uh after bin Laden was killed 'em in twenty eleven the ... basically mourn his death while saying I'm basically using his nickname on Twitter and Sam I collapsed
