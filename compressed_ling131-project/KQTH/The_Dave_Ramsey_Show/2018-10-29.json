cutie a Tucson news and talk\nWhatever wind ... dot com [laughter] Lars Larson show when\nAmerica is in a strange place these days we saw the circus like confirmation hearing of judge Brett Kavanaugh this scandal is charge against him and Democrats who demanded an FBI investigation predictably even after the president agreed to such an investigation and the independence sex crimes investigator brought in to do the questioning says that Christine forged testimony\nWouldn't even support criminal charges of of salt now entered a time in America were crazy allegations can be made against men and women\nThat doesn't even matter if they can be proved the person who's named as politically and professionally yet\nAnd it's a modern scarlet letter that apparently only applies to conservatives think of all the Democrats mayors and governors and members of Congress soup and reliably accused of terrible things the God help you if you're conservative that goes double for supporters of America's Choice for greatness Donald J tropical\nLars Larson show on went on for one taking the AIDS Tucson news and talk [laughter] Lars Larson show\n... nice so now the United states needs a new UN ambassador but it was kind of took everybody by surprise that Nikki Haley\nFormer United States governor was going to leave her posed as UN ambassador for the United states she's done a bang up job and by that I mean she's played up she's articulate and she's smart\nAnd she got the reward of sitting in the White House and having the president wish her well as she leaves her post I can understand why should want to do it\nShe's got teenage kids at home and she spent six years as a state governor\nWhich means she's been tied up with governments while her kids have been getting older I understand her desire to go home now the United states need somebody equally tough to take her job and start to represent the United states there and be tough with some of the bullies because believe me\nThat United Nations headquarters is full\nOf boys so Lars Larson show on went out for one taking the AIDS Tucson news and talk\nFor a time share repressed and every mom is a super mom but showed off a little more than others I think actually get from Minnesota for example thirty nine weeks pregnant she woke up last week to find her husband Andrew gasping for air so she called\nNine one one that reading at All right now\nFor example thirty nine weeks pregnant she woke up last week to find her husband Andrew gasping for air so she called nine one one\nIs that right in that All right now just pull him down to the floor [laughter]\nYou've never done CPR before but she did it this morning one\nTwo three great hauling up\nThe paramedics got there and really tend to the hospital they put them into an induced coma well actually who was scheduled to be induced the next day waited anxiously\nI kept telling him the whole time he was slain or in his coma but I was not going to have the baby and so he woke up hospital\nMoved their beds together into the same room Andrew woke up and actually did give birth afterwards a call from the dispatcher who helped her through\nAnd I'm very happy to know that Andrew is doing better and congratulations on the birth of your son went on what it's worth Sherry Preston ABC News\n[noise] welcome\nLine is that Americans most unified and we want to show the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony is fellow American citizens who ... you know the hungry like our country ... every day we are showing the world just how truly great we are\nYeah yeah absolutely we do need to unify but the thing and when I talk to people is it's okay to have a different point of view it is and it's okay to even at times argue the problem\nIsn't so much that it's the way that we see each other\nAnd we no longer see each other because of our tribal is because we're cloaked in the red and the blue or whatever it is we no longer see each other as human beings as Americans\nWe see each other as an enemy that's the that's the issue right there that is the the the big issue\nI'll say this wrestling fans get it [laughter] wrestling fans they understand that it's it's theatrics of all the things to turn to go wrestling\nRational are you saying last get it\nWell yeah don't you guys think that it's a it's fake\nFight we know are are you sure you're\nYou get a political wrestling which is what we have now they don't always get the motion bode well when we\nWhen we talk about unifying about like hey let's all come together and hold hands it's like hey we just agree for a second\nTo not be Richard Stone and other\nAnd that will treat each of like human beings and we can vigorously defend our positions and we can fight for the things that we think are right and in ... you know but at the end of the day we can at least part as friends as they are I you know what I didn't convince you didn't convince me but you know no hard feelings\n[noise]\n[noise] oh God it's just so it is so funny it is I I just just\n'cause I get it I'm getting it now getting people I mean the minute this came out and I did a video and you can pick it up to Facebook and and\nAs I'm doing it I'm getting people that are typing in hey chat MS\nAnd out and I did a video you could check it out the Facebook and and as I'm doing it I'm getting people that are typing in hey chat MS and is the enemy or CNN ... started this and it's\nAnd I'm just like oh God why does everybody have to be right all the time like\nWhy is there you get that every day with I'm sure a lot of you to on your like you know if you misspell something you know do a hundred things at once man I'll be tweeting I'll be doing a video of doing the show and do all kinds of things that will put something out there and ... and ... now misspell a word\nOr I'll miss a an you know I'll miss a comma or something and somebody's like you miss that I'm just like wow this is why you have no friends\nNobody wants to hang out with you 'cause you're always have to be right person\nAlways have to be right person is always alone were going out now who's going Jim a camp and the guys the guys always gotta want up me and he's always got to be right Ken hang out with that guy the guy so fun like I you know ... everybody's got one like that and if you don't have a friend like that if you\nIf you don't have a friend like that it's you three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter so I've I've got a a poll up\nAnd it's about monsters 'cause it's Halloween time and Halloween came out last week which will dominate against the box office probably about thirty five million dollars or what's the what's the monster what is the one what's the slasher the monster the\nCreature that you would say is the best of all time\nUh and we give you a few choices and then you could write years in a uh right now Michael Meyers number one number two Freddie Krueger number ten Jason Vorhees then I've got a lot of like creature Black Lagoon Dracula\nOr things of that and they nature that people are are are charming in too and it's funny because Freddie changed everything didn't\nBecause Freddie Krueger unlike Michael Meyers and Jason friday talked she had a personality that's what separated him from the other two who are maybe more menacing [noise]\nBut friday brought person out three two three five three twenty four toys ... best in show is your twitters Jeff and Jeff [noise]\n\n\nSuch as\n\n\nAs far as we become a nightmare for you do you dream of getting a full night's rest boy am I going to have those days are long behind me\nBased on my pillow I'm sleeping like a baby these days and so can you my pillow adjust to the shape you want and need tossed those flat worn out pillows and letting my pillow changed the way you sleep wherever they're the one and only solution to your sleepless nights my pillows are made right here in the usa with a hundred percent machine washable and Dr ... Khan\nA Kamala Harris has an interesting some sort of package I don't know if that's for certain but it looks like it and then Tom ... who is the uh the billionaire and California who's spending a ton of money trying to impeach President Trump\nOr so it's it's but it's it looks like at least at this point in time they've got the person and\nGood riddance to do bad rubbish now let's talk about things that are happening continuously we're moving towards the midterms and they're still something out there called the caravan and it's coming here and it's very very interesting remember this guy I don't know if you guys ever heard of this guy before\nBut this was a back a few years ago that he said this\nVery generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally\nAnd those were for them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked circumventing\nThe line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully\nOr the become immigrants in this country\nBritish filled you ever heard of that guy he goes by the name of let me see he at that time he was coal Senator Burr rock Obama did he go into any sounds familiar um let me give it a Google oh can you give it a good oh yeah that's where I used to be president United States\nUnder Brock Obama did he go daily sounds familiar um let me give it a Google okay you give it a good oh yeah that's where I used to be president United States so that was when he was center\nSo we got all these people coming here and of course things have changed because\nYou can change your mind if you believed in you know a a traditional marriage and you are a a bronco bomber or the Clintons and you can change your mind and I don't know if you you okay that's fine that is what it is but I think what he said there was was was fairly fairly good and we've got these people coming here\nAnd and we've got to ask our questions what in God's name are we going to do\nWith this because we've got to start doing something don't we we just can't continue on the way we've been doing it\nIllegal aliens should not be treated the famous people who entered the U.S legally\nI voted on numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a a a barrier to try to prevent um illegal immigrants from coming in\nWe simply cannot allow people support in for the United states undetected undocumented bunk shirt\nRight so there's that so so we would know is it that Brock Obama fellow I'm he I'm sure he went on to do something great but that other lady uh uh I think her name was a Hillary Clinton she cheated some stuff too and Chuck Schumer of course as we all know of of the Cherokee movies fame they\nThere's a lot so those are three of them\nJust stuff like that the factors that are coming here and they've all jumped ship if you will as far as what side that this now doesn't\nHelp them to be this way it only hurts them so they've got to go to the other side and said you\nKnow government in the region seems interested at all in stopping the migrants as they move for Texas once they arrive in Texas across the Rio Grande river the group will inevitably be met by West Wing lawyers who specializes in manipulating are dysfunctional immigration system and they're all but in for permanent residency in this country if\nHistory is any guide and that of course is the main reason so many of them are coming now one of our major political parties strongly supports all of this that's out speculation that they say it out loud often they do when they did\nWhen they didn't say it out loud but they said that it's not right now they said out loud that it is right\nOr that they at least gets it goes back to the the the the spilled milk analogy agave yearly both sides reach for a glass of milk it spills on the floor or we all know it needs to be cleaned up and instead of actually doing anything about it they argue over it and it just sits there that's kind of what this is a site\nIn general\nAnd there are some outliers in certain areas but in general we kind of you know we all kind of want the same thing right we want comprehensive immigration reform we just differ on the way that we think it should be not right we we differ on some of these things\nAnd this is one of those things where just depending on the time of the year what the weather's like which way the wind's blowing that people jumped do side to side and the Democrats are made no bones you no bones about it they are now part of hey come on we're fine with this where at one time they used to say no you can't do this\nWe are our strength and all the men that we are have faced hollering country we're coming in\nThe Central America many you're at risk if they qualify for a solemn we believe there should be\nWe're living in the\nCentral America many are at risk if they qualify for a solemn we believe there should be our process and what's the case can be heard in a fair manner protecting the individuals what's the Democratic party's message about the caravan we're\nA nation of laws and the laws that are on the books they deal with issues of refugees and asylum status and our laws require that may be treated with dignity and given that process\nYeah so they want to welcome that's it it's it's a political game and it's frustrating and I as\nI've talked to just as many people on the left in the right\nThey want to see something done and and like I said this is where we differ on watch we we want the same thing we want immigration reform that's done right most people I talked to on the right\nThere Ninety nine percent of them are like you like I don't care about the DACA kids what happened how they were brought here that they should be allowed to stay here for all intents and purposes there's as American as anybody else they want immigration reform done right\n\nAnd they know that the walls not going to be the end all the bill and they realize that it's much bigger than that and they want to see the laws enforced\nThe people I talked to on the left the the people who are common sense the the the middle of us the exhaust the majority they want the same thing they may not agree on the wall but they don't want to see people flooding here\nThey don't want to see this continue to happen they don't want to see the visa program completely ignored the way it has been they don't want to see the ports completely ignore the way that we differ on what we should do\nOne side maybe wants to crack down a lot harder\nThe other side wants a maybe not the crackdown is hard both sides want to see employers held\nAccountable\nIt's just how do we get there we differ on the path that we do we've got to start doing something now because now here there's a third caravan on the way here and you're just like a third of third care\n[noise] but let me let me give you a snapshot of what's going to happen they're going to arrive give or take last week\nIn November most likely the first week in December it won't be the size it is now because it all of start to break up the closer it gives the border because they're gonna start just wander off Arizona California those kinds of things and nothing will get done\nAnd a good majority of these people will end up here in America there'll be giving a date to go to court of which a majority will show up but it won't be for a few years and who knows what'll\nHappen in that time three two three

Semitism in America\nFor for any form of religious or racial hatred for prejudice\nDepresses obviously racist is obviously demagogues the opposite condos emphasis on the stump so National Center at all the stuff we've said without this Fox News out of the Republican Party what's happened to where the is there were both corrupt bankrupt his two sons that were hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump they've been taken over by Donald Trump than there were\nCourse much worse much ugly replace them they were five years ago ten years ago ... years ago [noise]\nUh that is John Heilemann\nOn MSNBC\nOr who sounds more filled with pain at this moment Donald Trump or John Heilemann\nAmazing really it's [noise]\nI mean I understand that the liberals like high all men are upset that the Republicans actually win again under Trump\nPrefer when Republicans are losing\nBut our praised for their tone\nThe liberals prefer I mean so you oh isn't it isn't you know whether it's you know John McCain God rest his\nSoul or George Bush or Jeff Flake they preferred a Jeff Flake type of person why because Jeff Flake a loses is\nEighteen percent approval rating in his own state they don't like someone like Trump or actually wins so when you when you must be hating\nDonald Trump loves the American people he loves the American experience he wants more Americans to be prosperous and he wants more Americans to be able to now live in safety and prosperity a sound fiscal policy sound foreign policy that's directed to the betterment of the American people\nIt's fantastic when the world is doing well it's great when\nA other countries' prosperity is is rising but the president point when he when he says you know America First Ali means is all just like with other countries are policies are going to be directed to making our lives better not anti Semitic not racist it's pro American\nAnd for a lot of folks out there the idea of being you're pro American itself as offensive\nThey don't they don't like this idea that you're pro American they think America is the best country in the face of the earth because that means that you by implication are criticizing other countries and that instead we need to be part of a\nGlobal understanding with their global rules in global there is a global order and the and so when the president talks about globalism global is\nThat's what he's referencing we have a sovereign right to determine our own destiny\nOur own set of rules for our own people our own policies for our own people that's what he means it must be ... understand that I think they get that perfectly well\nBut it it again it does not surprise me that this is where the left goes in the weekend of this the aftermath of this horrific act of evil Mike in Virginia very quickly line three Mike\nYes it's great to talk to you Laura I'm until the media and the Democratic party understand that there's three hundred million people in this country and that there is a small percentage that are going to be ... nuts and\nCrazy so um there's\nSeeing that there's a small percentage that are going to be ... nuts and crazy so um there's nothing we can do about them\nAnd if Donald Trump had not\nSaid America First do you think this guy would have not done this I mean again I'm saying it says that to connect to the ... it's just a desperate last minute push for voters in the mid term cycle where the Democrats might not win as many seats that they thought\nTo me that's a cynical play here is bringing Trump into you're listening to your healthy radio addiction we continue\n\n\nGuys good news the outrageously expensive little blue pill is now generic which means you can get the prescription medication to treat eating an affordable prices and him make that extra affordable right now get your first month's supply for free oh you pay is just\nEvery major University in America\nI'm supports students for justice in Palestine this love for you\nIt's a University in America I'm supports students for justice in Palestine this love footing hey group ah nobody does anything about it so you know\nBlaming Donald Trump or just exposes\nA the bankruptcy of the left and the Democratic party in particular I think the more they try to blame Trump for everything or the less credibility they have the more people will listen to what Trump is saying that's my view\nThere was a um we'll get to this mom and they were trying to drag the former rabbi and the current rabbi\nOf the tree of life synagogue into you know political conversation I'll get to that in a moment but the the never Trump ... a former conservatives I don't know if they were ever conservatives again on CNN Today use this as an opportunity\nTo trying to smear the President Bill Kristol spoke let's listen\nIf if the president wanted to come to our synagogue Newsweek and make some talk I Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate and that's you know ... and we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this\nRight here we don't need him but they're still in office and there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think there is an opportunity for him to to speak out a and to answer take accountability for\nYou know crystal is that these ... these people and there are truckers are just desperate\nOr to justify their positions says Trump has done everything that conservatives have wanted him to wanted actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done so the only thing they can do\nUh assassinate his character which is what they call it simply do\nThis is ridiculous the uh you know ... one one comment a and I I I've I forget it was in response to a question which\nElicited this where one could be done you said it would be have been helpful if there was a security guard in a synagogue or a security guards and lots of synagogues\nPerfectly wise recommendation\nGot attacked by the Democratic mayor of\nForward magazine which is an extreme left wing Jewish magazine blame him he said that Trump blamed the synagogue and blamed the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point\nA they're a nut case is out there uh who will kill a and a synagogue and other other centers schools\nShould be defended but the Democrats and the left are so few ranged over gun control issues\nThat practical steps like this are hard to take\n\nWell I think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the synagogue or the tree of life synagogue was also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset\nAbout the media really dragging\nThis into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world\nView this evil anti he was an anti Trump a fanatic that the shooter\nName I Will not use to dignify the airwaves but these airwaves but this is what um\nA fanatic that the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify the airwaves but you hear waves but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor a former rabbi excuse me of the synagogue that suffered so greatly let's listen\nHe welcomed the president of Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president's him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hate speech\nThe hypocritical um where'd that come from him um tell me nothing um we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city you believe in values not just Jewish values leaving values and those are not the values of friends and hats and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\nOr the current event that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say it as a Jew the Jews are out to lunch on this these issues\nThat first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked\nThe Donald Trump ... uh you know is a counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turn it on MSNBC the other day\nA on the coal lawless at a panel everything that there were four people on the panel was the Trump that said I I'm a nationalist\nAnd every single one of them linked that the adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist is dictator\nWell actually no I chose not to see any of the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who claim nationalism\nIs a Democrat they just won't find any pretext to link Trump to Hitler a Lawrence O'Donnell on CNBC he said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's\nWhite and then that translates into Hitler the hate against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny and as a tax 'em an ally ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing\nWell but these people they have done themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party\nAs a gone to war against the legitimate Lee elected president assistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy for political party ... we have a system of compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon the Gallup\nEstimate is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds there were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi who insist\nOn demonizing the president of United States which is something that hurts all Americans he is our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush too they called Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd a ... you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are some sober Democrats but they're\nYou know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are ... Democrats but there and intimidated by the party left now um but that they will come out of the closet\nYeah Jeffrey ... I have one and Alan Dershowitz yeah exactly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Myers does the current rabbi or who of course\nIt is just devastated by what happened to his congregation to his people he's worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responded like this\nRabbi I'm President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to come\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome I'm I'm a citizen he's my president he's certainly well\nThat's a good answer Neal ... you know every time I go I go to a synagogue I look around ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause I kind of universities are teaching jewel hatred they they are in our university the curriculum\nAnd the middle eastern studies programs but generally is that you know the Jews stole land the Arab land which isn't to genocide ally\nThe land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the Turks have not Arabs and they see the dilemma too because they were on the losing side of the first World War a\n... it just\n... you know there's this than a Seventy year aggression against is to destroy the state of Israel a and yet if you go on a college campus today the sympathies are all with the terrorists\nKnow it's pro pro Palestinian uh the Jews are\nUh the aggressors an on line today and seeing the same thing that did this was caused a anti are both the president's rhetoric and those Jews in the United states who are are helping support him and and continue to give him cover which I'm reading and stuff going\nThis is this is a literally insane I I I have no words to this\nExactly this is the best president or from the point of view of of of Jewish survival uh we've ever had\nA Trump I mean they you know that Komen and I somewhat his kids are Orthodox Jews for crying out two years I mean it's just insanity and are these so called liberal Jews\nEngineering is being absolutely super\nOh wait [laughter] with a superhero who can say your old high without\nFor putting up yard snow two fellows program he lose coverage of feeling I reach steals your fights with if the structural lighter to keep\nAnd it costs less even if you have\nNo flow called new Tucson dot com boom won three nine seven four or five\nWhen you live ... given the\nGum and will be no way in in a\nNew needs are\nTwins I made up their mind they ruin the big bone and this is what will they will be the mail you\nYou you know\nIn in um\nYou need to\n[noise]\nDot com to look at the most sensual information you know during the first one morning news is one of one Eighteen the hate the case you the age Tucson\nABC News\nI'm Scott Goldberg two days after eleven people were shot dead during a Sabbath service in spite of Pittsburgh synagogue the suspect\nWas in court slang fixed and all business the heavy set Bowers answered the judge's questions with a simple Yes sir outside the courtroom us attorney Scott Brady\nOur investigation of these hate crimes continues\nPowers will make his next court appearance November first in the meantime drugs to flight risk people remain jailed without bond Pete combs ABC News Pittsburgh\nHouse as President Trump will visit Pittsburgh Wednesday some people they're about to not to some Pittsburgh Jewish community organizations telling the president not to come until he denounces\nImmunity the rabbi said that he is welcome\nThe president saying a number of times over the weekend he denounces last week's violence and anti Semitism and you feel the ABC News Washington\nSees our ... sending pipe ... pipe bomb like devices the high profile critics of President Trump and the people the president has criticized also was in court this afternoon\nIs expected to be tried in federal court in New York however he will remain here in Florida for the time being as the court will first cash out whether he should be held in jail while he awaits trial a hearing on that is scheduled for friday morning after which say ox attorney Daniel errands and says they'll begin looking at whether they should be taken in New York where there's going to be a status\nHearing to determine whether we are going to waive his removal or want to remove all here in my criminal\nArt ABC News Miami the Pentagon says it will deploy around five thousand troops to the southern border officials say those troops won't be used for border enforcement rather they'll serve in a support role [noise]\nDay the down bounce way out then finished down losing two hundred and forty five points thoughts on track to have the worst month since the financial crisis [noise] you're listening to ABC News [noise]\nThings you find the latest coverage online anytime one oh four one K.

politician\nI don't think that's going to happen\nTrump's not a conventional politician he's going to do things the way he thinks\nAre going to resonate that's where the people are going to advance his agenda consumer spending by the way way up consumer confidence way up a three point five percent GDP last month even with some of the headwinds US Economy has faced\nAnd that's all very good news for this country All right we're going to take a break a with a lot more to get to run to Santa is going to join us of course he wants to win that Senate seat against Andrew Gillum\nAnd uh [noise]\nUh well no I mean excuse me the governorship obviously against Andrew Gillum and focus on the bill Nelson race against a former governor or the current governor outgoing governor\nOr and Brock Obama is in the state this weekend so he's going to end this week you can uh be campaigning for Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson the both the gubernatorial and Senate seats open a and it's tight say they're\n\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners or less the skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to call the airbags in their vehicles\nWhat issue right now at this moment in time or is motivating the voters in Florida many are now moving toward you they're panicking on the left clearly but what what ... what one issue do you think is most important\nI think it's protecting Florida trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy\nAndrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax increase that I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate that has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems they look at Andrew Gillum is somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump\nHow are you going to be able to get these problems solved which requires consultation with the federal government\nUh if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime they've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee what he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in ... history\nAnd I've been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because at the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked\nLaw enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities and abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow a ... a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection the Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about the\nOf President Obama has rock star quality\nUh in Florida how concerned are you about the allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\n[noise] so I'm not I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for\nFor Andrew because I think folks will uh who may not otherwise wanted vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nOr when it comes to the Missouri but durable regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down and don't forget you know we have the president of the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida and then likely come again before the election happens and so you\nKnow you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas um you know that put the race away for Ted and I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWell Gillum is um silver Tunde order I mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about our by political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tested he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen my grandmother\nUsed to say I have a dog will holler\nMiss the census has spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken at racist conferences not calling Mr dissenters races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course the ... are\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today\nUm there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boy Connors of Israel these anti Israeli organizations supporting Gillum the ... and you know he's not sign this pledge called dream defenders hum I pledge my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers\nAre of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles the virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera\nUh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond well yeah\nLike I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew is the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott digestion sanction\nOf the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they take special trips or just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the gods strip and so he's way out of step on that\nUm and I would never accept an endorsement from a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice um and that law enforcement should be defined it so that's what he said\nI'm In terms of the pledge he signed\nPresidents have no place injustice and that law enforcement should be defined it so that's what he said I'm In terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner and of course that's the FBI agent as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks but want to Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nWell that's right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message is showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton\nWas actually paid for by an undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago that that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nation governor campaign and indeed\nAndrew did not disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so he goes around saying that he's not been investigator isn't being investigated\nBut I Would ask the question what other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its problems with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating Gillum that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nThe laser ... down to some really simple in these last closing days it's just lazy this is sleazy politics as usual bribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politician jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a lot of ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurants it's sleazy\nCorrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida than definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states then you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled it's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership it's not it is it's pathetic and by the way\nA Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan\nI heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you got you know diagram that sends a but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll\nShows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better\nThirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states uh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not\nTo the United states uh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants and the caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help us kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want him to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the care of him\nOr this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance to the nearest refuge they've they've rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum a support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday that we need to welcome in the Caribbean and in the United states um and so you couldn't have\nA more stark difference um for borders Andrew stroke and borders I
