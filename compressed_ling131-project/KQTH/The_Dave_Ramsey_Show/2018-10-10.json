doesn't matter you know who takes the invitations more often than not the right side of the ... doll she's going to join us yeah former campaign manager for Trump\nIs going to join us right now he's working needs to senior advisor for vice president or\nA political action committee is going to join you talk about stuff that happened today right like this morning with Nikki Haley we're talking about cabinet or we're going to talk about two thousand twenty because I have an interesting question about who I think if the Democrats are smart they would put up to run against Trump\nBut we all know that they are going to do that we'll talk about that three two three five three twenty four towards your ... your Twitter C. J. D. B. E. N. S. O. N. ...

future and look their goal is dismantle ice led MS Thirteen run rampant give you know illegal immigrants more freedoms voting authority all these things and this president has said look let's run on my record of accomplishment lowest unemployment forty nine years\nA three point seven percent the greatest job growth that we've seen in decades the stock market's up Seventeen percent\nSince he was elected African American Hispanic unemployment lowest ever recorded every economic indicator shows that we're our country is moving in the right direction and so this notion that the Democrats had this blue wave coming I think is a fallacy I predict\nThe Republicans gained seats in the U.S Senate whether it's two three four or five that is coming and I would not be surprised to see a closer margin\nBut the Republicans have the opportunity to hang on\nPresident Trump is going to Iowa tonight he's out campaigning for candidates out there who are running on the Trump Pence agenda and he's reminding voters\nOf exactly what is at stake for weeks from today which is the opportunity and can you to move forward or the opportunity to go backwards and put Nancy Pelosi and as a speaker of the house and as a very scary prospect for a lot of people\nThat she's super excited about that she she feels comfortable in saying that that gamble is hers so I Would ... a senior advisor or a more of the vice president's political action committee so you know I look at two thousand twenty it's never too early and we already saw over the weekend you know the Cory Booker Spartacus was out there in\nIowa many more heading out there doing their thing it's that time of year and I look out there and I said to myself I don't see anybody on the horizon that for me on the left side that that puts fear that the people that are rolling out there seem to be the same old same and ... and and there's a question to me ...\nI like her I find her to be interesting I think she was the only one of the Democrats have met with the transition team for Trump\nAnd she gets pushed to the side because of this political machine that the Democrats continue to to throw out there and it makes me laugh because they're they're not they don't have a winning formula to have an identity and it it makes me laugh because I'm thinking to myself\nWell what's to be worried about if this is what you guys are going to continue to do\nWell ... it's a great question right and and the answer is no agenda no priorities\nAbout if this is what you guys are going to continue to do\nWell ... it's a great question right and and the answer is no agenda no priorities no solutions that the Democratic party and so you know where we're going right now for weeks from today is a it's it's truly an inflection point and\nThe people of this great country have the opportunity to go back and say do we want a jarring Adler\nTo me the chairman committee Adam Schiff to be the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence uh Maxine Waters to be the chairman of the financial services committee if that's what you want and you want to have your tax cuts rescinded that's what the Democrats are running on and it's the complete\nOne hundred and eighty degrees opposite of what the Republicans are saying the Republicans are looking at more tax cuts to release more economic prosperity to get the burden of government off of people's backed by cutting more regulations look when no one even talks about\nIs the fact that the president said for every one new government regulation in place I'm going to delete to he didn't do that he deleted twenty two so for every one new regulation twenty two have been cut and that is unleash massive amounts of economic prosperity and small businesses giving them the confidence\nTo grow and expand which is something that hasn't happened in this country in decades\nIf you look out though in the future who would you say is going to give Trump or a crazy run for you know I saw a ban and out there he likes to have an ... and he thinks somebody to take on Trump has to be fearless has to be able to\nTo to push back a little if you looked out there in the landscape because it's never too early started talking to them they're out there campaigning already who do you think you know you know this person this person right here\nThey have their their their stuff together they can make them\nLook here let me give you who the potential options are Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts okay not a real candidate a Camilla Harris from California Cory Booker from New Jersey and then a couple of other wannabe senators maybe a governor maybe the mayor of a South Bend Indiana\nThe guy the only guy that I think is a real potential Kennedy and it's because of his financial wherewithal is Michael Bloomberg\nBut he is so far to the left when it comes to the second amendment when it comes to mainstream issues but Michael Bloomberg has the ability to write a check he could write a two hundred and fifty million dollar check tomorrow and it's a rounding error in his bank account\nRight and anybody who has that type of access to capital becomes a serious candidate he's a he's a man who has demonstrated that he put a hundred million dollars of his own money to run for mayor of New York into the race and I want to see a guy like Michael Bloomberg because\nI Want to go on remind all the people in this country of how leftist policies are are they exactly how he destroyed New York city after inheriting it from Mayor Giuliani and all of the things that went badly and under his leadership so\nLook I think what you're going to find as you going to find a a free for all maybe Joe Biden gets into the race maybe Hillary Clinton gets back in the race and not talking about recycling John Kerry into this thing look if that's the case that tells you the Democratic party has\nNo future whatsoever and their four or five leading candidates are all recycled whether it's John Kerry and Joe Biden Hillary Clinton or someone like that these are all failures\nAnd it's time to move in a different direction and I think they're going to try and a balanced this ticket by having a Michael Bloomberg and then you know some ultra progressive ultra liberal on the ticket and that is going to do them which is perfect for us because the American people love with Donald Trump is doing\nThat so I you know and I I again the the Bloomberg thing would be interesting like I said I'm a fan of ... I think you'd give everybody runs his money but she's on the side she's out of mind she's in Hawaii and I don't think to to the to the radical left she's not far enough laughter\nGive everybody a run for money but she's out of sight outta mind she's in Hawaii and I don't think\nTo to to the to the radical left she's not far enough left and she makes too she's when I called the the the the ... the logical left and they don't want any part of that anymore you either you have to be a billionaire with was the name cache or you have to be you know ... or ... warned you have to go off the reservation talk of the [laughter] I don't think of the ah\nWhat'd you think of the the cabinet and stuff I mean it it it was a nightmare I think he could have been handled himself a little better at times but this let's not pretend that this was anything other than the ... an absolute political you know gamesmanship by by the left\nIt was and you have to remember this if it was anybody other than Donald Trump as the ... the United states they would've folded under the pressure of the left\nUnder the paid protesters under the fake news you know attacking Kevin I everyday attacking his family going after his credibility right some other Republican president would have\nPulled Brett Kavanaugh's nomination but not Donald Trump he stood fast he doubled down and he was ultimately proven to be right and if you saw last night what he said he had to apologize\nTo Brett Kavanaugh for the way that he was treated by the media and that's a sad state of affairs because it wasn't that long ago when Supreme Court justices would be confirmed in a widely bipartisan manner weather is sixty Seventy or eighty vote\nNot this one anymore because Washington is so broken that now we're fighting over something that potentially you know by Kevin ... had a beer thirty five years ago when he was Eighteen years old is a senior in high school and that's what we're arguing over and it's just insanity and I think what this what this nomination process has done\nIs unified the Republican Party\nAnd it reminded them that complacency is not an option and if they want to stay home because their economy is better their homeland security's better their national security for their economic security is better than there are consequences for staying home and the Kavanaugh fight is a clear reminder of that it's\nCrazy crazy last question appreciates criminal court Lewandowski rock and Roll Hall of fame has made the announcement of their ... nominees this year so I ... you know no ... got nominated ...

Thirteen year old girls to try to who was still listen to her music to go register to vote there all Thirteen\nThey claim that Seventy one thousand young people registered as a result of her coal now how do you quantify that do they walk voting station and say I'm a tailor girl signed me [laughter]\nWell they probably retweeted or something and then they they retweet it or not anything by the way we're also going to get into this\nIssue today on the show that we touched on last night about what is consensual and not consensual on college campuses as far as a\nSexual contact in what's happened with the title mine that Obama rewrote really interesting story at UC Davis a well we'll get into that we don't have time to do now a but Chuck Grassley is going to be joining us coming up how he won the Kavanaugh battle and what's in store next don't go\n[laughter]\n\nOh the following is not a doctor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nMy story begins with debt and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're inducted and you need help cold trinity one eight hundred seven nine for over four three summer when\nWhen we wish shouting out we have signed we're saying what we think we'll get to the public and we are not saying we got to tell anybody we gonna hit anybody oh we're going to cause anybody harm that's a lot in the way that they're trying to redefine protest\nIs is that correct I mean what are your thoughts on that [noise]\nWell my thoughts are this that public officials and and I I'm not a perfect public official but I think we're all on a set\nAn example of civility and so for US Senator say get in their face for congresswoman like her to say getting your face and then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants\nThat are surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong uh I Believe in a freedom of association\nFreedom of speech freedom to demonstrate but it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't intend violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic\nAnd representative government function properly or I got to be a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that\nShe ought to respect for people that disagree with our but in your face is in a way to do\nWell she said a year ago or that she was gonna take Donald Trump out\nAnd what does that mean let me she's at this I'm lesbian or gay algae beauty dinner and she goes incentive take him out\nAnd she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she was like take 'em out and\nTelling people that get harassed and restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated\nThe permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and in my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that but\nWhen you I'm Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator it's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you have portals Susan Collins people being ... screen data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in\nIn public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection we have\nBut then you can't have police protection for four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police or you can't do that as well\nSo are are are\nI've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are a democracy will be a stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening when you hold on called get in their face\nWell what what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or\nKamala Harris have to uh to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things this is\nCornering women in elevators this this is something and we have we have people threatening to kill Kavanaugh teachers in Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough times\nSome whack a noodle is going to you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help but so what responsibility does a Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise but they gotta they gotta responsibilities ...\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that guy say there go ahead\nNo wait a long time I think\nSenator Grassley are\nThe lessons learned from this cabin off saga [noise] uh this up many of us thought that in the beginning when we had to put off the hearing and and kick it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegation and any thoughts\nTo solidifying the rules so you can't\nExtend hearings past the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\n[noise] well I've read your tweets when you took me to task\nCalled me for for not calling for a whole bunch but you can't you can't ... if I call the vote today you want to we went along we\nWe tend to tend to rely on and so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here and you know doing it and so we we waited until we had the votes\nThe I didn't delete the ... because I set it on but I corrected myself and you and you and McConnell both\nHindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult\nAnd I think ... I'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night\nShe was disrespect and I said oh my gosh Senator Grassley said if you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more solicit isn't Dr Ford I\nI Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nYeah well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because uh in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to Anita Hill and I never asked a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor [laughter]\n\nOh my goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that I have to get you to react to um this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat North Dakota undecided divide vote against Kavanaugh a lot of people have talked about whether the\nCourt remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator high camp then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that it may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your future holds compromise something like this based on politics and I I Believe the smoke would have compromised um my true belief that this person did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nThey're still repeating that the temperament issues Senator Grassley\nHe listened this gets back to what I already told you got twelve successful years on the uh the DC circuit the second most important\nA court in the land has been college all or even people like Garland a said that he had that sort of a approach to judging\nAnd that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality that is a temperate you also leave your personal views out of\nOut of a decision making you look at the law and look at the uh uh get facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by\nSo consequently uh ... what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said plus your question brings me to a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record\nOf Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech ... what\nDid say Hi Carolyn ... or something like ...\nYeah so so ah you know after twenty eight years or listen to the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kevin ... going to bring great press stage and knowledge\nAnd academic background and more importantly his work on the second highest\nCourt ... court and it's all positive\nIt's it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people\nBut on the court a Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins um situation in Maine [noise] of course all these leftist billionaires promising a to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins and I know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking [noise]\nWell we're just getting started at that but a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree\nWith Susan Collins they got

ever it's called my pillow\nGuys I used to wake up with a sore head I often have one of those critics in my neck you know it's like you can't turn your head one way and your neck hurt forget about it I don't have\nThat anymore I didn't believe that my pillow was going to be so great until I tried it and guess what\nWell I'm I'm I mean I unlike you I Love Senator Grassley a and you know he's been tough on this whole Russian is of course the fabulous you but that was funny [laughter]\nHe keeps it at one death ... what's the word ... which I like when he was upset and it's like one level like me [laughter]\nI Love 'em he did a fantastic job and I thought I mean not backed by without about it now I I've always really liked it All right congressman what is going on now we had\nYou had a Trump flying with all Rosenstein or the other day down to where the heck when they find a Florida yeah and I saw a rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said what do you think of some ... dust on the president what'd you do you say some of your best friends what what what's the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts are facts and they've yet to give it McCain memos that we subpoenaed there are all these stories out a earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire\nOr tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording whatever they want to do um and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers by not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure if it were starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to ...\nWell maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said this to a or is it the stories that said he said it's been ... and this page and then when I talk to Mr Baker so a book will uh will hopefully he'll\nHopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we could asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman joined explain James Baker the or the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why his involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page McCabe call me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being recorded that uh he was he taught to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein and that he uh\nIn that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein and never forget the fundamental facts\nWhen did you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former director at ... deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to page FBI council demoted that left and of course Peter Struck\nThe counterintelligence demoted than fired top people the FBI demoted or fired\nAll the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein named Mr Mahler to take that investigation over so that's why this is important and that's why Mr Rosenstein needs to be in front of us so we can ask you questions about all that\nYeah he's not going to show up there's no way I don't think he I asked my productivity to no no he's he's not gonna he's not going to come I I just\nI don't know I've got to say I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and it maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself or get wired goad tape the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment go I I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely lawyer you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of support and it's I mean that is this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun up this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen may ninth as a date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire call me may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nAre lower as the special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel obstruction of justice and all those issues\nAt all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\nAnd again the the main question that is on the table I think is a mother's gonna do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve male an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of\nDonald Trump and if that's the other hand are now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and said hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned in\nPortland Carter Page where where does he go to get you know his reputation back in ... where does he go to get here legal fees paid I mean he's just twisted when for years\nNow I'm a I'm a ... it's good you brought that up because we sometimes it's important is that go back to the basics the Clinton campaign the DNC paid Perkins carried off or who paid fusion GPS who hired a foreigner\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally uncorroborated and that document became the basis we're going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other parties can paint\nThat is what happened here and ... and they used the press\nTo get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is a ... works for them she get information to her husband who didn't funneled into the ... so she gives information to resort to Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility I always say the more people talking about the live easier the law is to believe and that's exactly what took place you're but it's still a lie\nAnd they use that to go to spy on the other campaign [noise] it's\nAre your lawn of the um what's your what's your sense about\nKavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans to cut maybe some of the Democrat gains that there are still predicting in the house or how do you see this playing out\nYeah I Hope so I Hope so I was I was in or out about across our district in Florida the other night when people were fired up that that are sent it helps up\nAnd a perfectly good as it was being attacked by the left I think a lot of people are beginning to see that the leftist going completely crazy we did a tweet the other day I had more people come in and we said today's left a plot capital Nick destroy capital\nAnd that's today's left that they they embraced the radical but you know ... when he respects the flag embrace Cuomo when he says\nAmerica was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who support the president or an old by the way will destroy cabin on the prosecutor I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters I Hope it is staying over the next twenty six days and that we can keep the majority now\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\n[laughter] yeah I mean I think you have to uh I don't know if I started as if you are but my ... ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters deter first grants and we got what I what I call the treatment from a lady were\nOut and she started wearing a line of people get ... moving into the theater and um she just started ... you know yelling shame and evil and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that to people who are on the left but they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kinda just watch a little bit or\nYou know um look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate but just fight about and argue about the idea is let's not let's not make it personal what's not run people at restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do that they found to do it and it's safe yeah it's it's what they have now they're holding on to the anger by the way there was an interesting thing that I forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former um since the U.S attorney in southern desert in New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up or removing him as deputy AG let's listen\nI think the president realizes that if he were to get rid of a Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three and it would give mall or a reason to extend the investigation why wouldn't you want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're stepping down they've transitioned a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about over\nWhat do you think about that yeah I mean I I it seems like things are pretty quiet some they must be writing the report credit\nYeah I I Hope so and I think that's that's probably a ... that can be right and uh obviously respect to Mr McCarthy I'm In all the things she's written about always done so I look I don't think of any changes made the Justice Department until after the election until after about ... I think that that's obvious uh it's obvious that\nI'm the president wants that a new attorney general and um I think that that will happen at some point too but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election it until after the special counsel's work is finished\nA Jim Jordan always great to talk to Congress from ... Ohio congressman thanks so much will take a break close out this hour a lot more to get to Michael Savage is also going to join us stay there the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\n[noise]", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "10"}
