I'm In the end of the weight\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... number for some reason heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless\nOf what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out in these even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been on a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value\nPermanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is\nGone so you have a savings account that\nThe first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all so bad savings account\nYou have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all so bad savings account\nIt's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class\nTheir crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey is always at four twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind\nEver now I did get a horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than\nFifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nThe best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nWhether it's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind of let a broker shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of Neal and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that's the other a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the Dave Ramsey endorsement\nBut the reason he done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much so just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker\nYou know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with good with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agents in the business captive agent\nOr and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major foreign nation wide in Asia [noise] poor Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent [noise]\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and yeah but um and they're both good guys I like both of them it's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey show

situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business the point is what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers and how to treat people or they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality\nThey're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know so\nThey're getting ready to have a good dog\nWhen they're getting ready to have a kid go off to college is shop\nAnd understand\nBecause it is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can't afford\nAnd as you\nKnow we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of debt and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford\nThe basic resources and so someone will come along side and the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization is that we've had about four million students go through one of the coolest things happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good\nNow Tyler Moore is with me on the line and Kyle is from the University of Wyoming usually associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle White uh go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a pleasure to be with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming can be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide from practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lower resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot\nThat's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole\nWas behind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it for more and like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down there\nYou guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that\nCan be anyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enter spirit we're talking about curiosity and independence of boldness\nAt pursuit adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean is there a mascot right that's correct\nYour football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right\nAnd so it's just good I play on words but you you guys got you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it it's a great motto\nEd 'cause it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because\nThe cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are a state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college because sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of ... around the country I'm my own chancellor in ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nThe ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university\nAnd it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nSir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process at searching for our education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition Doctorow ranting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very\nCan be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping you'd be successful not just student success and part of that\nIs not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we had a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboy you\nKnow that's a good size school that's not too big and not too small that's that's that's just right those are ... deal just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again brother thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love tomato and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's a that's very cool stuff I Love it and what a neat thing that the college the University of the state is buying it for every single high school\nNow if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the state\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it would be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to at the in the building where I used to go to high school the other day it's now a middle school\nSo I had all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me\nThat's the hardest speaking you'll ever have all this time um but no as Anthony O'Neill's got tough

Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset in retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona\nFinancial an estate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nStock market the sock continues as one day we're up and then the next day it's back down [noise] so what exactly is going on in the financial\nWorld and on Wall street and what's driving markets today now that the stock market has officially experience it confirmed stock market corrections were values dropped by ten percent or more for many peak volatility is back in a big way\nOne of the major factors that has led to this correction besides the ... market melt up we saw in January where we saw stock markets up over seven percent Justin one month alone\nIs now all the talk about the end of free money\nWell you may want to know what is exactly free money and why didn't you get any of it well you did actually in a way but maybe not how you exactly wanted to get it the end of free money is referring to the massive quantitative easing stimulus programs at the Federal Reserve\nEstablished shortly after the big financial meltdown in two thousand eight and two thousand nine\nThis economic stimulus was designed to boost the economy by injecting low cost or even no cost capital or money into the banking system and on Wall street\nThis is called in was called quantitative easing also known as Q. E. and we had to eat one you eat two and three and then she we infinity\nNow here we are and the feds have officially ended quantitative easing back in two thousand Seventeen\nDuring this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation was still very low and yes did it work maybe but what did this quantitative easing or this free money really give us well it gave us low interest rates and most of us have benefited from that in some sort of way\nPerhaps a low rate on a house or a car or a business loan we've become addicted to these low interest rates\nSo has Wall Street lower rates also means low saving rates on bank money which causes us to seek higher returns elsewhere like in the stock market\nAnd well that has worked wonderfully over almost a full nine years now so here we are at a critical point in our history and our economy with inflation fears now at the forefront of discussion we've already seen interest rates now taking a little higher\nWe're now seeing spikes in the yields on what most consider a risk free investment and that is the ten year treasury note\nWent inflation starts to become a problem well the Federal Reserve will respond and the only way they know how\nAnd that is by raising interest rates and when that happens when interest rates rise that can start to put the brakes on the economy and then our whole economic cycle starts to change and our time of grow turns into a time of contraction\nNot that that's the idea of the Federal Reserve to cause a recession but it's just the nature of the beast it's economics\nAnd when that happens or there is even the slightest indication of something like that happening Wall Street is way ahead of the game on this and we'll start to see yet another bear market and perhaps one like we've never seen before where we can see drops\nSee yet another bear market and perhaps one like we've never seen before where we can see drops of at least fifty percent or more\nIn the depths of the stock market bloodbath after the crash in two thousand eight early two thousand nine the Dow Jones was trading adjust sixty five hundred that was the index level\nIf we returned to those levels again\nThat's a Seventy five percent drop from where we are today so again we're at a critical point one where the stock market still just hasn't made up its mind as to what it wants to do so why risk all your portfolio on something that seems to be just pure chance\nOur message here at Mayfield financial is different at our core is the principle of financial safety\nSafety is our number one concern and priority that your money your savings that you work your whole life to get our protected and that your portfolio has the right amount and the right balance of safe money\nInvestment advisors offered this unfortunately no this type of planning or the planning that looks to take care of your essential needs first it's often not addressed\nIn this Wall Street dominated financial world that we're in too many investment advisers and individuals try to seek sky high returns and run the odds it's all probability based it's about calculating risk\nAnd hoping that a worst than worst case scenario won't ever happen during your retirement\nTo me and for all of us here at Mayfield financial that simply doesn't work\nI don't like running probabilities when it comes to retirement\nI Want certainties I Want guarantees I Want a retirement plan that puts safety first and where risk isn't measured by what stocks and bonds you have in your portfolio but as measured by their risk of losing your comfort\nYour house your income\nThese types of risks are the real risks we want to consider when planning for retirement\nSo there are many questions to answer when it comes to knowing what to do with your retirement money in your savings and how to best position yourself for the long term so what is the answer\nWell it depends it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met and want to continue the lifestyle that we're comfortable with throughout retirement\nSo here at Mayfield financial we are a safety first retirement planning from\nWe take a look at your retirement plan and identify how to secure your income needs we can help you identify your essential expenses and\nWe take a good look at your spending not to force you to change your lifestyle but to see how having the right plan can help you meet those spending needs and even plan for rising costs\nThis is what the power of having a safe money plan for at least they part of your investment portfolio is all about\nWhen you put safety first you have a plan now to cover your income needs whether those income needs are now or five years from now or ten years from now\nThis type of planning is our specialty we've been doing it for twenty five years now with our family owned and operated Tucson based business at Mayfield financial our founder Jed Mayfield establish the safe retirement principles\nThat thousands of satisfied clients from all over southern Arizona use and enjoy\nJed was an amazing planner and an expert in this field thankfully I was able to learn from

looks at your retirement plan from a safety first perspective you can unlock an ability to have a more stable plan a plan with less risk and less worry\nThat's what this radio program was started for and why it's called the worry free financial solutions radio program of Tucson\nYou have plenty to worry about when it comes to retirement having the right retirement plan with your money shouldn't be one of them\nYou shouldn't have to worry about what's happening on Wall street and cross your fingers and close your eyes when you watch the evening news that's no way to handle your money\nInstead you want to have a plan that can provide you a solid foundation of income and when combined with your other income sources either pensions or Social Security or maybe a lemonade stand that you run on the weekends\nIt can provide you with the income that you are going to want to have and that you need throughout your retirement\nThe best example of this comes from what happened in two thousand eight and we are now coming up on the ten year anniversary of one of the worst financial crises this country has ever experienced Wall Street and our economy was brought to the absolute brink\nStocks were in the toilet and for those that had kept their hard earned money in Wall Street were decimated\nFinancial retirement plan based on probability and based entirely on Wall street where ruined the so called probability models didn't account for this type of market drop\nAnd people who are retired suffered a loss of income some were forced to sell their homes or what was left of their home value or even return to the workforce\nNow a retirement plan that isn't based on safety that built on guarantees what happened to those during two thousand eight nothing\nThose income levels remain the same for our clients and not a single penny was lost that's what a safe money plan is for so to see for yourself about how this works and what Mayfield financial is all about\nMake the call call their
