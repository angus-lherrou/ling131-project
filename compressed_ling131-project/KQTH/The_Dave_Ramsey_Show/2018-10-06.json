to the Dave Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] I think for taking my call Dave sure how can I help I have a\nQuestion are we are my wife and I are just getting started in baby step to\nAh we've got about Ninety thousand in that and we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a\nA commuter car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to call a trailer [noise] her car she owes about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise] um but we just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because it's ... percent of\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worse\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay 'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors and them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that though show or good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand okay\nBut that that includes the car the\nCar and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nIs true to a new job and we'll talk about your life and\nYour money Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement in college when somebody one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um so I'm going to be putting that into a chip five twenty nine I think for him and that kind of\nPicking out some stock mutual fund to kind of short coach from their Yucca um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I do with this kind of a pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses her for um you know every any given month because about twenty seven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now\nTwenty seven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only\nIncome right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then I don't want to know what to do with the rats shy shy throw it towards my how they all do that every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial planted tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year is the household income yeah yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it so I didn't know how that kind of played in the car does well\nI'll tell you that mandatory okay All right\nI probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four O. one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of the global and high hundreds\nFor me I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to smart bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business so I don't care what you do okay I had an effect my income at all\nBut I people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars\nAnd a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with you've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart Mr pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different being there and you know number ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nUh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby step six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Ross IRAs and any other money I find that my budget almost keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nA day I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't that a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty abnormal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional service academy or three years ago\nUm and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up in a collection the cow if I'm not able to pay the amounts and fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also wow\nSo you learn to you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can because you've got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to one thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou have to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either at the surf through in the\nOr you're assigned to the recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S treasury so you're the\nUm and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and has forgiven\nA yes or harbor in my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news on this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nHas you know but it can happen it can I address\nOn what happens is is that she's\nEverything child rearing financially and everything in a bi ever had you know but it can happen it can I have no choice on what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nBut that never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you know\nOf of her checking account because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case yeah so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of initially\nBut if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like going to see last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again borrow you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only to the Medicaid but she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they had control their she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as a semi mentally ill and she is way says she's not on a couple of different minutes she does\nWell her ... her only shot then as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nAnd it happens to people all the time so what does she say right now when they call her on ... so you get nothing so she does take up the phone you know you might as well but I wouldn't have long Congress\nNow when they call her and so you get nothing she does take up the phone\nYeah are you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them\nBecause you just you know because they're going to just I don't think I should be talking ... telling them either want to be I'm not going to long conversation it's got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that it just goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how their their during our pliable\nToday but she's got no money and you're not given or any no so they get\nNothing they get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll she'll a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight hundred there she say look at can we work at a deal yeah or you know they\nGot Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and work and again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that the settlement in full will do it\nAnd get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account 'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if they're malnourished moving it's still the industry so you got to treat them like rattlesnakes 'cause they are you got to really tender covering person here who's going into\nRattlesnake soon after she starts making some money you gotta walk whether emotionally on there you can you can give us a cheerleading ... without giving them money and I think you're right to do all of that there's good news show she can make it out of this year she makes a good choices [noise]\n\nOkay things are getting really weird out there

leave your fulltime job\nI'm extend a couple of years now and ...\nYeah [noise] I haven't been able to find anything else comparable to what I did [noise] um and\nI Will you let me tell you you're emotionally not pass that because you're the way you're describing it it sounded like it happened yesterday\nYeah I mean it used to live and you're living in the abuse aren't you in your head\nYeah I mean my kids and I we we were homeless for a while we we just know that there are a lot and I read he tried to cut the other day I might have had to go to court trying to deal with everything and it's been a lot\nI hear ya yeah so basically none of these bills the foreclosure are all the bills that he opened up and your name had been paid for years\nLike you were doing was the lead your here Kimberly Israel in Alexandria, Virginia\nKimberly welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDay thank you so much for taking my call sure a lot lately my\nMy my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old still works He works in a steel plant mixing up\nFour fifty to six fifty a week um about couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he had ... hey\nHe's behind on a lot of itself had a somehow got in a fifty thousand dollar loan from\nThe bank and he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and some of the security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I Do provide him so I took over all the bills and I do provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of the bat I'm Sorry what are you doing what the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying on and on paying his bills piecemeal has about um Fifteen K left on the equity ... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the couch\nI'm putting everything\nWas the turning out to do everything on on the day much money does that amount to what is it\nA month ... ...\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIf she ate on a car eight on the house and she didn't want to credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done in a year okay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right your ankles\nGet him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in a steel plant that I understand that right\nYes that there's going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of young my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on a Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we probably get there and uh\nThen the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some mistake for retirement but the fastest way to build mistake for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency plan in place\nAnd is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good to ask you this one at a bank loan and I'm someone at his age fifty K. and all you know four and a and to be paid off in twenty forty three knowing that\nHe wouldn't ...\nWell you know four and a and it could be paid off and twenty forty three and knowing that he went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now that yeah\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on that upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes we will go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered the dog that credit card\nSo I mean and dead people get credit card offers so you know it doesn't mean anything he doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing today I got to require retirement OK I'm here about a year ... and I'm a ... and then I'll have a while we pay off what are you good mhm\nI click here at fifty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before we have well we have for retirement age\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it say now whereas if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know and what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking after four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely [laughter]\nYeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U. S. is Seventy six averaged ... deaf I drove a female in the U. S. is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire Hi Todd how are you\nThank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nUm I forgot I spoke to the lady she said I can ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dream or I guess for a free spirit is you would say from listening to your show addict now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she's the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd um [noise] five we've set aside step one we got a thousand now we've put aside to the shaving she wants to say more than that but [noise] she I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um we paid off to credit cards\nAnd we paid off another credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me is about down the road is my retirement and I worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got\nAbout ... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over book in there\nYes it is I started to read that I haven't read it\nWas totally make over has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids\nAnd so it's going to walk you through first thing you do just save a thousand dollars you get on a written plan you and your wife or an agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay I Want you to do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say but I was in dollars if you've already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except your home busting your debts\nSmallest allows you attack those was caused by getting rid of those that famous and now you've got the ability to invest\nThis baby stuff so that book is going to want\nSure you and your wife are women that yeah there you get on the same page because I'm\nPlus face it this is a hectic time of year but here's the deal it's not an excuse to lose track of your spending especially when we made it so incredibly easy for you with our sorry budgeting tool called every dollar with every dollar you give every\nSeeing how that affected other people in the hopelessness that they felt ... and I'm just let them know that there's another way to do it as a better plan\nIt was a good words those words telling me you'll never go back now now that this is the good life and I ... my friend Rob that's what he said let me see him every morning we worked together and he's that free too\nAnd uh we just talk about your life is right now yeah Mm men will show you brought your girlfriend whether you're what's her name is Lauren and that's my mother ...

buyers through text messages she joined ABC's Rebecca Jarvis on her podcast no limits to discuss the business and how she and her business partner Gen Hyman\nHave help lift up other female entrepreneur\nIn addition to the business that you've created that foundation project entrepreneur where you're helping other women entrepreneur is did you go into the company thinking eventually we want to also have this other arm\nAnd how did you build out that other arm when you were so focused on building a business at the same time yeah oh great question at such a privilege to not only don't rent the runway but the rent around my foundation and our first program their project entrepreneur and a combination of summit with action oriented workshops\nAnd then an incubator and um you know in general I turned around the runway and we didn't have this like yes there will be the rent there only foundation a plan in that sense but we did both share a passion for empowering lemon and I think in our first couple of years we really took advantage of and thought how our network and so many entrepreneur or generous with their time\nWas critical and humming journey and so what we we felt very lucky and grateful to have that\nI think we ought to gradually it's hard to see it the business grill that female empowerment with part of the rent rent my brand\nAnd in my story became tied to rent the runway as and how do you know we were women going after our big vision and dream and the community felt that kind of energy as well and many of our consumers\nAre power businesswoman\nAnd they're using our dresses to kind of take on the next kind of career move in their life and\nUm I think wearing a great outfit makes you feel confident and empowered so it was very authentic ... will be where um you know why we decided to start of it and started in the throes of still running you know rent the runway at the time and now running another business is because those\nWere who we learned the most from ourselves so we found the most value from other entrepreneurs who were still in the next day to day\nThere were maybe a couple of years ahead of us but they always kind of whether it was and they knew what the price per square foot of an office space was or what health care provider we used to talk to or just you know extending that particular networks they they had that real hands on scales that that\nWas valuable to us on and so we believe that we could offer that through an incubator program in a really unique way to women and wanted to pay that\nForward and to your point there is so much about being an entrepreneur that isn't the business itself I mean the health care provider where you located because those are things that most people would think of it like fundamental to the business idea but if you get those wrong yeah they don't have the business\nThat all of that you know infrastructure to have stopped him to take up a lot of time especially in the first year\nThat the place where with Wal Mart relationship I've been really grateful to get just this running start but you're ... you know so many pieces of starting a business and building a team while you're also solving a consumer problem when you're an entrepreneur and um you know we we try to get females\nBoth those access to the kind of that infrastructure answers and I'm kind of perspective but also resources on data analytics\nProduct engineering how'd you recruit how do you hire 'em and what we can say is you know each entrepreneur who enters its fairly early stage but they still have different challenges and goals that they're addressing in this program so we try to think like how can we get each of them to that next stage in their career\nAnd I was hired the biggest thing we see across entrepreneur ours is they're often not thinking are dreaming big enough\nAnd the where I think we're able to add the most value and and a goal to Jen and I feel passionately about is\nPushing them to think you know we have one company that's I'm bringing dental care and dental hygiene two officers right so they're trying to people are in their office more working more like flu shots come to her office by can't dental hygiene come and it's like\nOkay we'll make a dentist come jobs for the appointment yet look for the whole authorizing can Booker slot now they're they're in your office and it's during the work every six months to a dentist shows up right thing and so we're like well doesn't just have to be dentists like could at the doctors could you know like what other services could it be that are coming to the workplace and kind of making more efficient use of\nThe employees time because he didn't have to leave the office et cetera\nBut also the employer or get that advantage of like if it's there they ... do you play didn't have to leave for two hours for the appointment so just like stretching to have to think about could it be bigger can think of other industries as well\nWhat's one thing you learn the hard way I read the runway that you're now applying it jet black\n[noise] gosh [noise] um I mean I think learn the hard way around the runway you know\nBeing hands on with technology as much as possible I Am not an engineer as you not have a technology background and one of the early mistakes Jen and I made was\nWe found affirmed rebelled at our website I read the runway and completely just hand it off their requirements documents when we worked really hard on all the details and what we thought it needed to look like and um then we're like okay now they're going to go about it and they're going to just end up over a website and a couple of months and it doesn't work like that right and um I think we we learned the\nHard way for rent the runway and website back we didn't look the way you wanted it at the website backward\nAnd then we waited another week or two and I wound up buying into Canada where the theoretical team of seven engineers is working on the side of like one person\nComing in at noon and there was like wow anything so I had to pull the plug in you know we lost them the money and not really a day and hire a different team who\nWe are way more hands on and he'll belt something and like a month and a half that with our national labs that are on the runway\nAnd you'll hear many stories that like that's like I don't think that's rare and entrepreneurship but that happens I'm and luckily we were able to launch it all worked out great um but it was very stressful and intense and so as much as like I'm Still not a wizard

million dollars in safe money client funds right here in Tucson and have over one thousand clients that enjoy our retirement income planning strategies\nSo what do we do and why do our clients love us\nIt's pretty simple we are safe money advisors and for that certain part of your portfolio we do not recommend or use any strategies or investments\nThat have a potential to lose money from stock market risk we have never had to have a conversation with any of our clients about why they lost money due to stock market performance\nNo of course we're more than just one trick pony is over here and Mayfield financial over the years we have assembled an entire team a financial specialists that can take care of everything you need in the financial world in retirement\nBut here at Mayfield financial we believe and know that getting this first part of your retired\nAnd part is so crucial so we focus entirely on that\nAs safe money specialists in the financial world we can help you turn that part of your retirement portfolio into what it needs to be in retirement and that is income income that last one that grows and is protected\nAnd now it doesn't have to be income that starts right now some of the best planning takes place about five years before you need to start to use your nest egg in retirement before you start to need to get that income\nSome call it the retirement danger zone and that's about five years before and after you retire\nThat's the time where it's most important to look for and speak with their retirement income specialists one that can create a guaranteed income stream and protect your retirement from stock market losses\nIt's about building a foundation of income from that part of your portfolio to create the income for that you are going to want to have in retirement one that will take care of your essential to cover your needs to take care of those basic expenses\nWhen you do that you unlock inability to truly have a worry free retirement\nSo to learn more for yourself on a stabbed pushing a foundation of income and about working with a retirement income specialist and to learn a little bit more about Mayfield financial\nInto our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets\nInto income and in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings\nSo unless you are super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan and it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it\nAnd your retirement plan to even enter it in some call this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of them and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement especially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives\nThis is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track however as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later\nFor one case and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey failed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees this is the power of having the right plan in place\nSecurity and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plants do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive\nAll with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no commissions paid by you so what do
