I mean it's just to me I don't find it to be entertaining and I don't mind that stuff gets political but the way that comedy used to be especially in shows like this like Johnny Carson did not care\nWho you were\nIf you were in power you were going to face Johnny's rat Saturday Night live was the same way at times\nIt's not that way anymore as I said over the weekend it's an active is you know improv group that has barely watch will and\nHe says it is sad because you got this platform that's great and I don't mind that you hammer one side the problem is is that is all you do\nWhen you have chances to to go after the other side you don't do it and and as a person who looks at this and says I can laugh at both ... I can laugh at the right I can laugh at the I thought what they did that with Susan Collins was hilarious [laughter]\nWhen you can proud\nRepublicans running the\nCountry or ... pounds of people really warrant convert all everyone\nThought from white men over sixty white men over\nSeventy [laughter] we're going to be [laughter]\nVery in contact all works out there with Vietnam for straw [laughter]\nBut it's it's yeah and I know I like to see this the way if I Would have done this is a perfect example of how they missed the opportunity right and this is this this is where you are able to bring because I think it's where comedy can bridge the gap of this giant fathom\nThat we have between us right now where and pretty should really you know that you watch sports as much as I Do everybody fight to be in the winning locker room nobody wants to go to the losing rocker room where it's quiet and nobody saying anything it's after the super bowl or the ...\nEverybody fight to be in the winning locker room nobody wants to go to the losing rock a room where it's quiet and nobody saying anything it's after the super bowl or the NBA championship or any of these things and and talk about\nYou know what happened last night well you know it's just one of those things and it would have been a hilarious if they would have went over and threw it to somebody else at the other side of the locker room and they could have been talking to people in the lottery which I don't care about the balance it just would have been funny\nAnd they knew\nThey failed to do and that's my issue with with with comedy it's like there is a perfect opportunity nobody wants to be in the losing locker room if you're a reporter unless of course you don't want your soup messed up\nRight you don't want your time is up you know what you're you know ... if you're a woman you don't want to be drenched in like both sides it's hilarious I fight you got to put on the goggles and the whole nine yards and they could have gone further with it and they didn't they didn't I Would ... I Would have had checked a\nUh I Would have Mitch McConnell just they would have poured Gatorade on them like the big thing it would have been it would have been\nSo much more entertaining but they failed to do that and I just I don't get it I watch some of that but comedy is one of those things though where I look at something like Saturday Night live and I say to myself you are appealing to ... New York\nChicago\nLos Angeles San Francisco maybe Seattle the rest of the country you don't care about you're not interested in anything other than that\nPeriod case close three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at me I Love to hear from you Bill Maher over the weekend talked a bit about uh this\nWhole situation with with Kavanaugh\nAnd there are social justice warriors who are crazy enough in this country I fight with the both the time [laughter] so they they lend enough ... to make people think oh you know what they're going to go after my high school record that's fair game now and it becomes sort of a privacy thing\nYeah it does the high school record now when he was talking about absolutely social justice warriors one hundred and ten percent while they're not as big as we make them out to be the issue is is we give them way too much power in this day and age and he talked about the whole believe thing\nIt does seem like things are more ... more from listen to any woman who says she's been wrong which is the right thing to do to automatically believe it here's the new that's what's scary here's what Republican\nYes yes that's what's scary\nBelieve believe period\nWe don't need you process we don't need a trial we don't eat anything you just make the accusation and that enough is all alone is to be believed one hundred percent and due process and everything is out the window\nAnd I don't think that's good for anybody and I think that's what Susan Collins tried to say the other night about Kavanaugh and and I don't see any of the stuff that goes on anymore with social justice warriors because you only have to hear a tidbit of a story to formulate your opinion\nAnd then you run with that even if it's taken out of context even if it's a or whatever is that whatever happens we just we just run with it automatically we pay no attention to the rest of it because you're not interested in the full story the facts and the data you're interested in in affirmation of your belief and you can find a nugget\nYou gonna run with that three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... had been to chose your Twitter let's talk about what took place over the weekend shall we\nJust dismayed which\nWere a fight how did they go kinda got ugly it did and I'm not talking about the fight and talking about the fight the fight back to the program I Love hearing from you can tweet us ...\nWe're a fight how did it go kinda got ugly it did and I'm not talking about the fight and

[noise]\n\nA good night's sleep is the foundation for good health not getting enough sleep can compound the facts of stress on the body not to mention lack of sleep contributes to premature aging an awakening\nSleep is just as important as diet and exercise but I tried my pillow for the first time and started staying asleep longer and sleeping more deeply I knew I found a real solution to the sleep issues I'd been having like no more than ... the differences real unique to experience of yourself\nYou can't do that in the back of my car let's just say for the sake of argument I have a top right or something like that you can't drink in the back of my car partying it up and not wear a seatbelt if I got pulled over at that some serious issues\nBut they kind of overlooked is that kind of weird little world of because I think it's a fair question and when you have twenty people die\nLike that as an Eighteen him in a limo and to outside of this I think it's a very serious question three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had meant that shows your Twitter you can tweet at us today is coal lumber stay\nIn a two seconds press release Columbus ohio a city of more than eight hundred thousand people named after Christopher Columbus announced its offices are open for business on Columbus Day visiting spokesperson says the decision was made not too concerned posed by Native American groups but rather because the city can't afford to give workers both Columbus Day and veterans' day off this fall\nLast year Akron, Ohio failed to rename Columbus Day after two previous failed attempt Cincinnati renamed Columbus Day indigenous people's day\nYeah because Columbus was the bad do I mean that's that's the essential\nSide of the Columbus as far as people are concerned politically is a it's a horrible human being because he came here and he killed untold millions and he brought disease and all of these things with him and he's just an evil person and it it it's ... it's very interesting the way that people\n\nCome at this because we take our modern sensibility right so we have all were woke now we're such a ... society seal woke we are with everything\nEquality all of this stuff the way it is it the quality of outcomes where we're headed everybody's getting stuff everybody's great if you if you believe in this then you're a great person if you believe on the side just some sort of phobic which I never really understood I got a huge argument somebody over the weekend when people are saying you\nTransform making homophobic and I'm like I'm not scared of any of those people who want what you think that I think you're getting it wrong but\nIt's funny the way that we we approach this 'cause I look at it like I can I can see compartmentalized time so I like I can look at this day and age say I'm going to put this over here in this day let's let's break this down I'm looking at his\nIn his day which is not today right\nWhich is five hundred plus years ago he and his day he was a bowler\nIn his day in his day he\nWas the Neil Armstrong of his day\nWhere it try to open up new trade routes were doing all kinds of stuff look at the way we're going to check this out like a lot of those people back in those days Magellan and and and all of these these ... it was a dangerous thing right\nSo in his day he was the mayor\nDid he understand that he was going to bring with them diseases that ... that the natives in there you know indigenous people in the areas they were at ... we're going to die for God's sakes come on now\nWe\nUnderstood that we sent our people to the ... right and and and the first man opens this week is a perfect example of so we sent\nThem up there to the ... right we'd sent you know the Russians beat us to space you know and then we were there and what is the first thing they do they they take these guys and they put 'em in areas where they can't contaminate anything 'cause the last thing they want to some sort of weird superbug we get that now they didn't have that kind of modern technology\nThey didn't they were just a little bit behind\n\nThe the way that ... was he a bad dude at times he was but they were also we again we're coming out things like this in our modern sensibility of\nThe way that ... was he a bad dude at times he was but they were also we again we're coming out things like this in our modern sensibility of were were politically correct where well we understand all of these things and ...\nAnd we look at and we say it's bad because we look at all of our ... it's not just Columbus I mean look at what they're doing in schools now when they're getting rid of people because well\nIn this day and age\nHe he was for slavery or he owned slaves or and we go back and we start picking apart things and that to me it's ridiculous\nIt really is you have to be able to to look at this and say I can look at you in a way where I can understand in your day and age who you were what you were about and in that day and age in that time that\nYou live that's how things were done\nAnd I don't think you're a bad person or or anything I just think you are who you are in that day and age you don't think a hundred years from now people are going back at us and they got stupid we are\nThey're gonna look a computer thinking oh my God they had to play in computers that's what a while they didn't have special eyeballs that became computers got out of their lives\nRight how did they live of course they are\n\nAbsolutely but people can't do that nowadays they can't take a situation\nBecause the goalposts moved and politically correct we all want to be woke and we're trying to re rewrite our history in a race certain things in a race people\nIn the race the things they did for the world\n\nBecause they don't like who they were based on the time that we live now and you just can't\nDo that right you just can't do that and if\nAnybody should understand that it's people like sports right like this is a perfect example of of always trying to compare sports era's right like oh this era was so much better than this era\nAnd that era and they fight it all the time but they don't want to take away any of those errors they just want you know talk about how great that we just want to race all the history could you imagine back that egg on let's get rid of Babe Ruth altogether\nRight baseball has one of the most infamous human beings that ever played major league sports Ty Cobb was a racist anti Semitic awful human being beat up a one armed black grounds keeper and when his wife came to help he beat her up he shot a man\nHe was awful\nBut people can look at it and go you know what yeah okay but we're not going to get rid of all the things he did out there but we want to do that and we won the race in history is where we are now we want to raise our our founding fathers ruined ... all of these things and it's funny because you know having lived in Europe and done all this stuff\nThey look at their we we we look at our history\nAnd we're ... we're ashamed and we talk about a horrible you are with all these things and in Europe when I was there they didn't do that they they touched a little bit about that but they didn't they didn't want to rewrite it now they're snowflake heat world is starting to try to do stuff like that and you're seeing a lot of that especially in in in Britain but it it's amazing because\nWe have this generation that wants to rewrite history wants to get rid of everybody and we want we we we want to look and say we were so bad here let's just a race all of this together\nLet's just do that we can't look at it as this was their time this is who they were\nWe can't do that anymore now it's just you're evil and I find that to be ridiculous I don't\nTheir time this is who they were\nWe can't do that anymore now it's just you're evil\nAnd I find that to be ridiculous I don't think Christopher Columbus was anything other than a man\nWho had some ... say give me a couple of votes picked three of those men give me some money we're going to go do this right some of you still think we're going to fall off the ears right that is just that some of your flat or if there is out there that we're going to fall off the earth I'm a show you guys that's not going to happen\nNever

after Christopher Columbus announced its offices are open for business on Columbus Day the city spokesperson says the decision was made not to the concerns posed by Native American groups\nBut rather because the city can't afford to give workers both Columbus Day and veterans' day off this fall last year Akron, Ohio failed to rename Columbus Day after two previous failed attempt Cincinnati renamed Columbus Day indigenous people say\nYes because Columbus was a bad do you mean that's that's the essential side of the Columbus as far\nAs people are concerned politically is a it's a horrible human being because he came here and he killed untold millions and he brought disease and all of these things with him and he's just an evil person and it it it's ... it's very interesting the way that people\n\nCome at this because we take our modern sensibility right so we have all were walk now we're such a ... society seal woke we are with everything\nEquality all of this stuff the way it is it the quality of outcomes where we're headed everybody's getting stuff everybody's great if you if you believe in this then you're a great person if you believe on this side you're some sort of phobic which I never really understood I got a huge argument somebody over the weekend when people are saying your trend\nIf you if you believe in this than you're a great person if you believe on the side of some sort of phobic which I never really understood I got a huge argument somebody over the weekend when people are saying you're\nTrans phobic and homophobic and I'm like I'm not scared of any of those people who want what you think that I think you're getting it wrong but\nIt's funny the way that we we approach this 'cause I look at it like I can I can see compartmentalized time so I like I can look at this day and age say\nI'm going to put this over here in this day let's let's break this down and look at his\nIn his day which is not today right\nWhich is five hundred plus years ago he and his day he was a bowler\nIn his day in his day he was the Neil Armstrong of his day\nWe're trying to open up new trade routes were doing all kinds of stuff look at the way we're going to check this out like a lot of those people back in those days Magellan and and and all of these these ... it was a dangerous thing right\nSo is that he was the mayor\nDid he understand that he was going to bring with them diseases that ... the natives in there you know indigenous people in the areas that they were at ... we're going to die for God's sakes come on now\nCome on we\nUnderstood that we sent our\nPeople to the moon right and and and the first man opens this week is a perfect example of so we sent\nThem up there to the ... right we've sent you know the Russians beat us to space you know and then we were there and what's the first thing they do they they take these guys and they put them in areas where they can contaminate anything because the last thing they want some sort of weird superbug we get that now they didn't have that kind of modern technology\nThey didn't they were just a little bit behind\nBut the the way that ... was he a bad dude at times he was but they were also we again we're coming out things like this in our modern sensibility of where we are politically correct were well we understand all of these things and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd we look at and we say it's bad because we look at all of our ... it's not just Columbus I mean look at what they're doing in schools now when they're getting rid of people because well in this day and age\nHe he was for slavery or he owned slaves or and we go back and we start picking apart things and that to me is ridiculous\nIt really is you have to be able to to look at this and say I can look at you in a way where I can understand in your day and age who you were what you were about and in that day and age and that time that you live\nThat's how things were done\nAnd I don't think you're a bad person or or anything I just think you are who you are in that day and age you don't think a hundred years from now people look back at us and they got stupid we are\nThey're gonna look at computers thinking oh my God they had to play in computers that's what a while they didn't have special eyeballs it became computers got out of the loop\nRight how do they live of course they are\n\nAbsolutely but people can't do that nowadays they can't take a situation\nBecause the goalposts moved and politically correct we all want to be woke and we're trying to re rewrite our history in a race certain things in a race of people and it raised the things they did for the world\n\nThey don't like who they were based on the time that we live now and you just can't do that right you just can't do that and if anybody should understand that\nYou just can't do that right you just can't do that\nAnd if anybody should understand that it's people like sports right like this is a perfect example of of always trying to compare sports Eris right like oh this era was so much better than this era and that era and they fight it all the time but they don't want to take away any of those errors they just want you know talk about how great that\nWe just want to race all the history could you imagine back today go let's get rid of Babe Ruth altogether\nRight baseball has one of the most infamous human beings that ever played in major league sports Ty Cobb wasn't racist anti Semitic\nAwful human being beat up a one armed black grounds keeper and with his wife came to help he beat her up\nHe shot a man he was awful\nBut people can look at it and they go you know what yeah okay but we're not going to get rid of all the things he did out there\nBut we want to do that and we own a race in history is where we are now we want to raise our our founding fathers ruined ... all of these things and it's funny because you know having lived in Europe and done all this stuff\nThey look at their we we we look at our history\nAnd we ... were shamed and we talk about a horrible ER with all these things and in Europe when I was there they didn't do that they they touched a little bit about that but they didn't they didn't want to re right now they're snowflake heat world is starting to try to do stuff like that and you're seeing a lot of that especially in in in Britain but it it's amazing because\nWe have this generation that wants to rewrite history wants to get rid of everybody and we want we we we want to look and say we were so bad here let's just a race all of this together\nLet's just do that we can't look at it as this was their time this is who they were\nWe can't do that anymore now it's just you're evil\nAnd I find that to be ridiculous I don't think Christopher Columbus was anything other than a man\nWho had some ... said give me a couple of boats and pick three of those men give me some money we're going to go do this right some of you still think we're going to fall off the earth right that is just that some you flat or if there is out there that we are going to fall off the earth I'm a show you guys that's not going to happen\nNever understanding the ramifications long term and and it's so funny 'cause some people are like well look\nWhat he did if he didn't come here somebody else would have\nRight it's like it's like the ... people thinking if Elvis when that come along right like that we would never found rock and roll when that happened and wrong it would have somebody else would come and maybe that somebody would have been a horrible human being three two

Laura now one eight five five forty Laura\n\n... as a matter of outstanding intellect agreeing scholar and his credentials are on surpassed known as the judges judge he is a fair minded unbiased and even handed per se [noise]\nThen\nYou are listening to the Laura Ingraham show a five five forty Laura oh let's go to Richard in Texas the fake news is all over covering the protests they don't cover the Tea Party the same way I did that\nHow do you think that Brett Kavanaugh would have survived\nWould have survived walking through the crowd\nOur country to succeed if it means our country doesn't embrace open borders open markets gender fluidity\nAnd all that comes along with it so if it means more Americans have to be poor but at least we're bracing all those things then that's better if it means that China eclipse as the United states but we as a country are more socially liberal then that's okay by them really that's that's how bad it it doesn't even having to a Trump\nIt has to do with their upset that the American people have rejected what they're doing\nAnd if they lose the courts the court is their agent of change for the most part the court gave them a of course same sex marriage that Obama campaigned against\nAnd Clinton said he was against and Hillary said she was against until of course the court and found the right to gay marriage in the constitution now that's done and they want the court to do other things like that\nAnd push the country into this direction that the country wasn't going to for the most part most states are going to vote for at least not then see I think it's better to let things percolate naturally through the Democratic process and then you have less to ...\nWhen you short circuit big issues and big decisions like you saw the roe versus Wade in Nineteen Seventy four and in Seventy three evil short circuit of the abortion issue was short circuit meaning the court took the power from the people and decided it for themselves and then they force it on the rest of the country\nWhat happens\nYou know all these years later decades and decades later the country still totally divided about abortion because the issue was taken away from the people you can't do that\nSo when I talk to Steve Bannon coming up on the left is rabidly camping up its base how many of you believe that the Republican Party has the jolt now that it needs going into election day or is there still complacency out there\nOr because you didn't get everything you didn't get the wall built yet that\nWe're not going to you know we're just not going to show up if if that's your attitude then you can kiss this country goodbye you have to show up you have to do it you have to vote for Republicans and if they don't they're not perfect they don't get everything right all the time but I'm telling you take out take a look at that crowd over the weekend\nBecause we'll have Maxine in charge Mazie Hirono Cory Booker Kamala Harris and that whole crowd oh I'm Sorry ... All right a five five forty Laurel talk to Steve Bannon a lot more coming up\n\n\nOr your word your identity could be held hostage there should be because ransomware does exactly the losers Tom Kelly suit your boy auditor making every American suited for from the effect of our do served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best things you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and we're just a buck up your computer often\nAre area of the law he's very much show so what I called the construction industry to state is really a a a a the second horse harness what's what Judge Gorsuch and that's the point it doesn't matter\nWhat their what they did with judge Kavanaugh is the politics of personal destruction they want to destroy people that stay in their way and I think it was very evident awe of what they did they try to destroy him and his family and it doesn't matter to put a moderate Republican up there and they'll they will try to do this\nWell and again this San ended up showing us that you know when it when it ... when when it's needed you can have Mitch McConnell actually stand up and fight and when the Republicans are unified\n... they can do anything I mean\nThat would be nice if they were that unified on the wall and all these other things that the president wants to do\nMaybe this is the ... the irony of this is maybe it's the first woman as your listeners know law I've been up the crowd of being at the cutting edge of this kind of anti establishment a effort I've I've you know battle Mitch McConnell for many years we disagreed on on just about every topic but\nWe got to you know he he stood tall normally Republicans cut and run\nThe first down to the gunfire from the social justice warriors they will run because they're afraid of being ... they're free to being called racist Alfredo all these false accusations Mitch McConnell with the president stood tall\nAnd actually shut the distance or\nAnd I think it was a seminal moment and inflection point in the Republican Party and now I think we've got everybody you know it's like I said nothing but great things about the actual column for the last three or four days of the reasons he deserves kudos he really show real leadership and did not cut and run a judge kept if the cutting ... ...\nHis confirmation was a proxy fight on the Trump presidency and I think it it it it the who's everybody to really understand that the Republican establishment and the populist movement and the grassroots conservatives and the Tea Party efforts of the you know all the evangelical groups all pulled together and that's that's why we want\nAnd that's what it's going to take this November and quite frankly I take that going forward so hopefully law this is the beginning of people saying you know we've got to work together this is what happened in six to ... you know when I step into the campaign in August\nWe were quite fractured everything pull together and wasn't me it was ... it was many many people that can be together to bought the grass roots together people like you with your show that brought the grassroots effort together with the establishment and we won in ... that's the lesson well where's the night it\nPut a difference is off to the side we can defeat the Democratic party and here's the stakes are so high look at what happened at and look what happened at the vote objects capital on the floor of the United States Senate\nLooking at people have had given their lives to this country to defend the rule of law at the center we have that that behavior of those protesters were just unacceptable and what happened afterwards which is really kind of model that's coming so if you want to make sure that the\nLike the senators were harassed or an attack in the Senate and if like Ted Cruz and his wife were basically a ... a by people at a restaurant and the chase down an alley if that's what you want the future will be built up\nBut if it in a bottle you may have to vote for somewhere and I was in your district maybe a congressman that you're not particularly enamored with it doesn't matter right now it's all about the Trump program it's all about President Trump and going forward and that's why we got to pull together\nWell we're talking to Steve Bannon here on the ... show the ah the generic ballot has shrunk somewhat but these distill the Republicans' biggest hurdle Steven these house races seems to be women voters women strongly are still supporting Democrats and some of these key races has been a four point lead\nAnd what um the the\nPost Washington Post in ah the shower school\nAnd they pulled a\nAnd this was districts as of August twenty fourth a lot has changed since then but apparently it's about a four point advantage Democrats hold I think that's actually good news and it's only four points\nI think it's great news is really down from ... one poll live audience just keep in mind when Paul Ryan decided not to run you were talking about sixty votes or than it was fifty I went on Sean Hannity on hundreds day to go ... I was saying it's thirty five to forty we're now within\nThe kill zone this is very winnable was all of that she was an agency even the post story to days a little dated because it doesn't really talk about what happened after capital might make what we are going to see is remember President Trump won a white female voters fifty two forty eight which done Hillary Clinton\nDe won a high school educated white voters female voters sixty nine thirty one some enormous number President Trump does resonate with women\nWho who understand national security and women who are concerned about law and order a women who are concerned about the economy will jobs so I think we have to get those female voters out and I think they will come out I I every numbers you look at the trend is in our favor it's trending it's trending to to uh stopping this blue wave\nAnd and people have to understand if we stop the blue wait\nThe Democrats are going to turn on each other in a vicious way between the Clinton Wall Street hunter and these kind of social justice a basic cultural marks on the left tear each other apart and I think leaders to a massive victory in two thousand twenty that's why it's such urgency\nFor people really the focus on his house districts in the in the coming in the coming three or four weeks that we really this is all about\nConservative of the Republican at all or is that people understand it's about self reliance is about getting up and doing something this is a hundred percent in our our zone right now to to turn this around I think you can look at every number the trend is that our favor\nYou know I certainly hope so see before we let you go let's talk about what's happening in Europe\nI Know you have the movement is called a in Europe or ... you've done some more akin to Italy we see so many there are and other leaders I saw Le Pen was meeting with solving any yesterday the day before\nInto trying to again ... recapture the European a cultural understanding or that it's been so threatened by poor leadership mass migration et cetera and where do things stand in in Europe I Know it's mhm every country is different but where things stand now\nYou know this kind of populist nationalist revolt a ... year ahead of where we are in the United states that's what great it kind of came up before a brags that and the two thousand sixteenth victory Donald Trump are inextricably linked you're seeing the same thing\nIn Europe right now ... basically what it is it's the same kind of Tea Party grassroots revolt\nYou know ... ... evangelical Christian revolted too soon over in Europe what you're saying is people that want their sovereignty back to their countries are tired of the EU is really a global organization has tried to take their\nTheir national sovereignty and take the value of their citizenship away from that whether it's on migration economics a whole host of other issues and you're seeing leaders like Le Pen in France or the alternative ... Deutschland leaders in Germany sell any in Italy or ... ... all basically versions of the ... out of that this is a global ... even in Brazil\nGonna see last weekend we had a we had a a\nLaw and order candidate I took the lead oversight could be the next president Brazil on a global basis you're so this whole gets kind of the secular humanists um um you know a global is agenda\nAnd you're seeing people on the on the right or you know start to start to take a start to take their to try and take their country's back and so I Would tell all your listeners to really focus on what's happening in Europe because I think it's great for water\nFor the continual revolution could this continuing revolution we have here in United States to basically take the country back and let the citizens run it and that the wall street and the corporate has\nA lead in the permanent political class it's in Washington DC\nDon't get to see that for the for the last in the global assumed people like Colin Powell who came out um last weekend or friday whenever it was like oh it's it's basically saying you know it's so embarrassing for us in the world stage with Trump\nThey would rather have our country not do as well economically\nIf it means they're not embarrassed among their liberal elite friends in Europe\nThe general Powell of a lot of respect for it's just very disappointed he also doesn't really understand it since the missed the point that I used to it and other things but President Trump just hunters were juvenile rejuvenate are alliances throughout the world with is America First but\nHe's also putting them he's inextricably linked\nA amid the economics of trade right with with our national security is the first time anybody's really done it that's why you see what one little China\nJust solving ... pants about to do a bilateral deal with is that you use our toes they're going to end with us on China trying to shift the global supply China but what he's trying to do is is is you know you make these two and say hey they're part of a package\nAnd there's people like General Powell I mean honestly the general ... date was kind of embarrassing because he's so detached\nFrom really understanding the details in particular I hate to say this on NATO\nOr the president has done more to try to reach juveniles the NATO alliance by having\nArt to step up and pay more for their own that's what President Trump says that we're looking for allies we're not we're not we're not a real power and not try to be when that looking for tech and what happened is NATO in Europe is basically a protector of the United states it's unfair to quit when the overall economy in Europe\nIs about the same size as the United states and so people just got to step up and start being good allies and see people like General Powell ...\nOppressive shop or you know day in day out but I think when he really ... happy talk though what I call the high school with language and look at the details President Trump's basically right of all this stuff and guys like general out just at all\nOr Hello Mr ... how are you Joe I'm doing great how are you heard of ... how's the real estate market in Tucson the market is terrific here in the old bubble of diverge you ever the ... program in Tucson yes I can have our listeners that cash\nOffer in twenty four hours with no commission and no closing gossip with no repairs gr now do you buy all types of real estate yes Joe you name it\nWe buy while ... you're going to have them in offering twenty four hours or you can lose their property if they need top dollar right yes Joe that is correct ... that is the best of both worlds or sell it or ...

September seventeenth during the cabin are crush\nThe Trump Administration is disarming a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting at the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies who believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from in may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to do this to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward in contentious stand up between Trump\nAnd representative of Iran\nSeems like the Trump Administration was right about this one stay there [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments that Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with the rate shield you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nAnd what it is really about organizing and and really thinking about that worth organizing segments for people ... strategic an\nAccent or we're in bringing together a coach who said strategy of putting pressure on the chamber instead of only focusing on the pressures inside and sure enough she thought\nThat's a really interesting thought okay I don't know what she just said we played a shorter version of it on TV Now wishing we played the whole thing because it's funnier\nCan you can you can you\nUsing her phrase can we segment some of that James so I can listen to it again maybe I'm just a little ... right now because I haven't slept enough maybe I'm just a little tired last night was a big night\nNo it was a very I mean I'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night\nAnd we were celebrating at the White House it was fantastic everybody who helped Brett was there all the justices were there everybody was there who\nYou know who who really was instrumental in helping the nomination this confirmation his law clerks his old law clerks who helped it was great great to see everybody but maybe I'm just a little tired so I Can't follow the brilliant and incisive logic of cost of your court as\nWell I think a lot of it has to do with changing our strategy around we got her hand you know there's a lot of inside baseball and inside the beltway as you know you can only say that term thrown around\n...\nOkay these just asked you what are you going to do and she answers well we're changing our governance strategies inside baseball\n... forgive me but she at least what I've heard she seemed like a very attractive person and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person she got people to go out and vote vote for her she probably a nice person I don't understand what you're saying\nWe need more organizers okay you'll be in government you will be in there\nBut you see all goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct to lay on top of the u._s. understanding\nAs it has to be like all abortion all gender fluidity higher taxes\nOpen borders legalize everyone legalized\nPot all all of it has to be fully sit on the American people [noise] so like Obama she\nNever really will leave the organizing world there are very few organizers will Congress and I think that organizers operate differently is different kind of strategy\nYeah they they're they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan and claw at things like the Supreme\nCourt big brass door\nThat Supreme Court video how many have you thought it was as funny as I did so last night on the angle every time I ticked off at Trump's agenda item winning agenda item Everytime I did that\nWe played a snippet of of the protesters clawing at the door to make a point the better things are getting in America the more than happy they are\nBut the ... I just found that to be a scream by the way there are a lot of\nDifferent angles that people got with their cell phone videos of the protesters clawing up the door so you can see like the the hundred and twenty pound guy\nLooks like he's wearing skinny jeans he's banging then you go and you see the woman there's like this this liberal woman who's like trying to pry open each of these doors of I'd walk through them enough times I Know\nThese doors probably way their their ceremonial doors they probably way I don't know four hundred pounds their giant clawing at the door is trying to open them this is kind of a metaphor\nThough isn't it for what they're they're trying to their clawing and banging at the more traditional understanding of America [laughter]\nShould America down this\nShutting the traditional understanding of America down about ... ... they know they're not going to shut the Supreme Court down scores of course going to go on and heard oral arguments this morning they continue to go on\nBut it's about shutting down you your voice intimidating you so you got your back in the corner of an elevator it's about shutting down this idea of traditional families it's about shutting out the idea of\nUnderstanding of American history shut it down pulling statues down with ropes and the middle of the night it's all a piece of what they are and what they become\nAnd its
