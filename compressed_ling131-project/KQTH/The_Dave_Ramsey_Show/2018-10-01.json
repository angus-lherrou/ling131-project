remember in fact I was witness to the night that he got\nInto that fraternity and he was stumbling drunk in a ridiculous ... and things are really dumb things and I can almost guarantee that there's no way that he remembers that night\nYeah that right there is somebody you know some ... she was a classmate of of him so it it it's okay I Love how they bring out is excessive drinking because what they're trying to do is paint a picture that this guy might have tried to do something 'cause he was so drunk well your fraternity\nRight ... how many of you out there got a little ... at a fraternity view\nAnd we've seen a lot of stuff that's going on in the last few years for the ... when it comes to paternity right that doesn't make him something and for all of that stuff that she said she did say this now listen carefully remember this is about a sexual assault\nThat's what this big thing is if we're going to go back to drinking being bad this that and the other than everybody on that I bet you everybody out there in politics has to leave\nAnd never witnessed any untoward um sexual advances towards women that were unwelcome I never witnessed anything about that\nAnd they're in lies the whole thing maybe he lied because you're trying to paint a picture of him is this this alcoholic kid running around you and all kinds of things which could paint the picture that he is some sort of serial rapists which would you guys were trying to do and\nYou could say all of those things but the woman he just said he's a big part of you like to drink and I I saw him at the night he was put

cynicism in this right like I'm cynical because of the way this is is played at sale itself out I think anybody who's reasonable would feel the same way\nThen all you have women right\nBecause you need to support or you need this or you need than it's us for us versus them so many critical why is that U.S forces that might be us versus them\n\nBecause that's the way things are designed this Republican versus Democrat is right versus left it's black versus white it's gay versus straight it's man versus woman it is so stupid it really is\nIt is it is ... ... and what that does will become more and more like that will become more and more a slave to the echo chambers\nRight chained to our tribes if you will change or red and blue are Democrat and Republican we we we're we're we're there and in we we serve them\nAnd it's it's not right I mean you've got to mind is the greatest thing in the world be free thinking be open minded\nWhere we get stuck in these things and it becomes us versus them\nAnd it is it is very frustrating like I can like you can't even keep an open mind and enough to go\nI look at lazy Florida and I find it to be credible I think the things that she did I think that was a a a friend take away whatever she was talking about right like take that out of it because I'm trying to explain this do\nSo you take that out of it just put it in the context of what she had to go through being a person who really didn't want the limelight who the Democrats wink wink nudge nudge through or into the limelight because then you would further their agenda\nThen she had to come across country and the world is watching her not just us but the world is watching her she's friending she's she's she is a you know she's now pop culture and all these kinds of things\nTo go through that it was like wow right like I could sit there and go man that's ... that right there I Would have some strength and you know to look at Kavanaugh and to go through this stuff knowing full well what he was going to go through from jump\nAnd it doesn't matter who the next person is no matter what side put somebody up for something to know that your going to be facing human Kavanaugh said yesterday I expected some stuff I didn't expect this I think anybody does\n\nCan sit there and go wow I've I've got some admiration for you because it is it is an ugly horrible thing and and knowing that parts of the the globe and in America I hate you and the other parts love you and neither side knows you is is just really\nHuh but we've turned everything to us versus them and I was talking to a couple of my friends who work in the uh the political arena and and and are fairly well known and they said look you know\nTo us versus them and I was talking to a couple of my friends who work in the uh the political arena and and and are fairly well known and they said look you know there are a lot of people out there on the Democratic side\nThat\nFeel like this is a big sham\nThat this was definitely an overreach but because of the peer pressure you can't say anything and there's a lot of people on the right that believes lazy for a little bit more and have serious questions but because of the situation there and politically they can't say anything\nAnd so somebody like Jeff Flake could because he's got no skin in the game anymore he's done he's not running for reelection seats up everybody knows that\nSo it it it's just like the people out there a lot of how many people voted for Trump but if it was a robot that called you do one of those you know those surveys you might have said you like Trump if it was a human being you were less likely to say that because of this fear of judgment and backlash\nFrom people because we've created a tribal world where it's got to be us versus them\nAnd that's that's not going to move us forward that is that it's absolutely not going to help us at all three two three five three twenty four twenty three ...

could have been you know the Democrats yesterday let me tell you that the service that\nFeinstein and other people did Dr Ford they lead their name they had her name the intercept do who originally printed story about who she was the oh they didn't do it yeah\nIt came from somebody it may not have been somebody inside of your your your quote unquote group there Dianne Feinstein and your staff but your staff got some something to somebody who then turned it over to somebody else so let's not pretend you're the one\nWhy because you wanted her to be more vocal you wanted to be out in front you wonder if you couldn't you couldn't just say and anonymous person said this that's not going to move this thing for so you put it out there and then you left there hanging\nYou did\nYou left there hanging you used her as a prop and you use there is a tool\nBecause you don't want this to go through and you're pissed off about Merrick Garland you're pissed off about a lot of stuff you're you're Jennings up your base as much as possible erasing tons and tons hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars off this\nYou're grandstanding and giving a voice that people are going to be running and twenty twenty you do all of these things so don't tell me it's not it's all about doing the right thing trust me you guys senators and congressmen and women that they haven't done the right thing for a very long time they do what's politically expedient for themselves\nThat's it\nThey don't care about any of the other things it's about what's best for them and how can I maintained the power in the feed them that I have right here how do I maintain the power and the fiefdom what do I do how can I get my basic keep my power to keep my fiefdom\nThat's it that's absolutely it\nIn this partisan BS that we we are tribalism my people are worried about you know oh Jeff Flake the enemy of the people are Dianne Feinstein is this or all of these things deep state you know what our biggest issue was in this country and we're going through a I I I call it a\n... we're going through as a civil war of sorts there's nothing to do with guns or any of this stuff as always do with the with the society and our culture or cultural civil war right now we're battling it out and we're our tribalism is so insane and are just staying for one another so insane\nThe tweets I get the tweets I've gotten today that tax message I I've gotten of of you know F you Chad or you're an idiot you're a moron your number ... says everything I Need to know about you\n\nBecause you've come at something where they were with with such a narrow viewpoint these ads seven investigations and twenty three an FBI this that and the other look\nThis is happening this is it\nHow could you say that you believe her because I Believe that something happened to her\nThis is it\nHow could you say that you believe her because I Believe that something happened to her I never once said it was him that did it but I Believe something happened to her absolutely oh you're an idiot she's a blanket he blanketing blanketing blanketing unlike there you go\n\nThe left doesn't do it it's it's as stop it's enough it is absolutely\nEnough so he knows now does Trump\nBut they have to do what they think is right there is no message whatsoever they have to do what they think is right to have to be comfortable with themselves and I'm sure that's what the far yeah\nAbsolutely and flake did hold a lot of that power being that vote\nBeing that person\nAnd he voted yes to send it to the floor but Mitch McConnell knows that he's not going to vote the way that that you know Mitch wants them to vote unless there's this has done so Mitch has no choice I think butts to move forward and and asked the president for\nYou know a full FBI investigation and philosophy I investigation how long has it can say it's gonna take a week it's not like there was a cold case files there's no crime scene there's none of these kinds of things that they're going to go back and try to find DNA and this that and the other what they're going to do is they're going to talk to some people\nAnd put together some information and those those questions may last a few hours\nAnd then they'll present it and everybody's going to move on\nIt was incredible it was an incredible moment I think in the history of our country [noise] but certainly she was a a very credible with this\nYeah she was a very credible witness and and he went on to say about her\nI thought her testimony is very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman [noise] very fun woman\nSo but this is what we've got so the geo peas is exploring everything and and they're looking at everything and uh\nThey're going to you know potentially move forward and they know that they can't move forward with a full vote if they don't have the people they need which is the three or four that were already on the fence and flake already told them I'll do this with the caviar that you either do this or I'm going to vote no so what choice do you have at this point in time\nAnd he wouldn't have done that probably without Collins and or Murkowski or does it um but when you\nIf they don't do this I'm with you three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet at us but I just ask\nYou for once just to take

mere job interview for joining us now is a former attorney general the United states [noise] uh Mike me Casey\nWho is also of council amount of uh to the great law firm divorce plump than a judge it's great to talk to my friend how are you\nI'm fine thanks how are you I'm very well um so your your take on\nThis reopening of the FBI investigation background check into Kavanaugh there are some Republicans who say well this is a good thing because it\nUh gives cover to people like flake and Collins a to actually vote for cabin on in the end\n[noise] you know this has been about I'm delighted from the get go\nAnd I'm like what's most eloquent here is the treatment that this guy from from ... she said well this person asked for confidentiality I'm\nJust could have been investigated by the FBI authoring all requests for confidentiality from the outset if that's what they wanted and um I think everything has to be judged in light of that\nWell and it it would to me it seemed very obvious uh from the very beginning\nWhen they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the airing screaming at him\nThis was going to be a farce and so it didn't really surprise me given the fact that the left believes the Supreme Court just another\nA super legislature and it's not really a court it's more of uh\nBody to the left in for them it's all abortion and and various social issues and cabinet even though he's a Bush guy or doesn't matter and he's a fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\nWell um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be that who\nGets appointed came to be so important I mean there's one judge has started um are putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly\nLimited a statement from the constitution that happened a long time ago when when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's from a number of surrounding the other amendments I'm quite clear that\nSome people on the court foot that were that they can make it up if they want a long and so then I guess it very much matters who who's had his popping out from beneath a black great [noise]\nWell judge there was a a woman or I'd never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who identifies herself as they Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally I've never heard of her but\nAnd then so be an either now so she she\nShe know express something that I began you you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race of Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here\nWhich is I'm entitled to this I did the hard work in high school and college and I deserve this was the end of that is not the case no one is entitled to bow on the Supreme Court and no one who has behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and no one who performed the way who did it on Thursday\nDeserves to be even an judge\nReaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race um I I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow how one\nAppears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think we are to kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side the weird conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan you you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats\nYour high school\nI I don't know why why high school when I go back to sixth grade I mean why is just high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your your character and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know useful\nIndiscretions pass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not\nFor this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually\nSome people on the record saying well we saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and she got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive and responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nIn the DC circuit he doesn't the temperament\nThat's that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know if he loses either way\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast right or the president said FBI can has free rein that's the phrase the gay free rein a\nWell free rein to do presumably what the Senate requested um the Santa requested um\nA limited extension of the background check and background checks are are not about you know are not about ... I'm not criminal investigations and then I ... ... counter intelligence ...\nTheir background investigations and they interview witnesses lay out what they say and present it to the side which ultimately makes the decision to finish the not the president [noise]\nNow the um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on\nOn all of this so I use it you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying well then he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation is yeah well\nAgain if if high school and college drinking is now is now from the free love generation this is this is a this is now what we're going to be judged on I I I don't know who want\nWant these you know these nominations I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly he didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all do stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just that\nOh heaven for fan right yeah no nothing nothing stupid\nNothing stupid at all because you're you're you're um UK is ... what the rest of us did\nNo um [noise] if there's anybody who um would be willing to have every day of of his you've um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weighing on this um\nThe American bar association a supposedly it was a it was of course it was improperly reported early on uh that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you know highly qualified to be on the court and turns out it was it\nThe president of the of the ADA picked up a pen and at his letterhead a and wrote something he wasn't authorized to writes um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that the ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nAnd he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton uh and so you know the again\nInitial reports all over cable on friday when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again headline readers and written reporters don't do their work does it oh this is ... that's a really bad and now of course we find out that that's all\nNot true a judge thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate your insights and and we'll check back with you soon you're listening to the lower income show eight five five forty Laura Jeff Flake a lot of you from Arizona calling in chime in a year reaction to what he did on friday\nLittle citizen festival with a with his friends senator Coons and also on a his appearance on sixty minutes on Sunday he's enjoying his little waning power like that when someone has power over you they think they have power over you they enjoy that\nThat there are certain people that like exercising power over others and they take advantage of it I think this is his last gassed and he's enjoying every minute don't go\nThere are lots of Dennis out their choose carefully for your health and health your family\nI'm Mike rap remind you that strengthen the family dentistry as an expert practice now to location serve you better one by speedway well ... the other by river and oracle same family friendly atmosphere both officers repayment plans to help you get your needed dental work done\nWon't be referred out to another Dennis for specialized procedures you'll be treated by staff you know and you can trust\nAbout six months braces great results\nBooks won't even know you're wearing break just find out more at seven four five six eight seven one I'll give you that number again the about implants consultation is free along with the latest high tech\nThree D.

case the UVA case and so many other cases over the years where people are wrongly accused and this is in in wrongly accused in a kind of narrow timeframe this is thirty six years ago more contemporaneous timeframe this is thirty six years ago but\nThat was John Dickerson ... so again men are trying to prove themselves the I care I care I care Alan Dershowitz was on CNN this morning had some very interesting insights and a Fox and friends excuse me with some very interesting insights let's listen\nTo it if a liberal Democrat president at a point of the first Muslim American to the Supreme Court and somebody said oh yeah I remember he was a terrorist when he was Seventeen the ACLU will be all over this case no you can't presume guilt of terrorism but when the shoe was on the other foot\nWhen it's a white man being accused by the left\nOf sexual offenses all the rules are called off the rules are presumption of innocence the rules of due process we know is guilty 'cause he's a white man she's a woman she's a survivor that's the end of the inquiry\n\nThat I I Can't agree with that that any more than if you're a white male and you're accused of something you are presumed guilty not presumed innocent you are presumed guilty\nThere has to be a a a happy in fair medium here we don't want all we don't want women to feel like they can't come forward of course they should come forward one hundred percent it's a serious serious crime sexual assault doesn't norm is damage to a woman psyche and her future life\nBut at the same time you cannot do this to all men either say there\n\nIf you're tired of paying maintenance feats of the time she can't even use you need to call resort relief now\nSo many of you who have them don't want them you want to get out of them but you feel stuck they'll help you get out of that contract legally permanently and a hundred percent money back guaranteed\nIf I have I reached a level of affluence or importance or status or visibility in which anything I did in the past now can be used\nTo destroy my career and the other half is Armand happy and is that unhappiness due to an event by somebody else who's now pretty important and should I use that to express my on happiness and take out here\nSo it's a very polarizing atmosphere they've created I think they don't have any understanding the what the Senate does on national TV given the traditions even if it isn't a criminal case but when they dismantle the protocols of due process of\nA they say it's just a job interview or whatever they call it that dismantling affects all of our other institutions whether it's you know kick you know a little league coach or saying the teachers in schools should be fired or your neighbor uh shouldn't have shot a gun on where you are how all those disputes when they even then when they don't reach\nA level of criminal a status nevertheless their educated on the spirit of the constitution and these guys are the constitution doesn't really matter anymore in matters of sexual assault\nWell when we when we see the\nFew moments of honesty from the Democrats are when they really talk I'm candidly\nIt's about the fifth vote on the corner it's not about whether Brett did this or whether they're and none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote in the court and then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said he admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would have\nA he never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation vote\nWhile I mean yeah it is about the fifth\nVote but there isn't a symmetry there in that sense that\nWhen the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after when ... said I Believe that a wise Latina mix better decisions on a white male they didn't go scholar and so you're a racist and we're going to stop your they didn't go after Elena Kagan's so early college years\nAnd they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland they've tried to use political use majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nA that's going to be conservative and therefore has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote there would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions and say you know and this guy's taking us down the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school\nThe way they went out that's that's a progressive idea of it the noble and justify any means necessary to get there\nYou know it's also interesting I I think is how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both candidate on foreign are white ah but listen to this um tower of intellect Donny Deutsch than MSNBC Becker let's listen\nNow for an entire generation women going forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way particularly post that capital performs that as a man I was embarrassed that he was supposed to mean display of all white title met\nThe man who made his money or in part by opening up you know PR NPR from selling selling snake with other people and also\nYou know hanging out at strip clubs by the way in self Donny Deutsch\nWell I think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that they've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being devoured you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear adjudicate who we are that is race class\nNot classics using that race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire white woman who's been who's running against like Kevin daily on a person quote unquote\nOf color and the same thing is true of Chuck Schumer and the string things through cones there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal and old white guy\nBut they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they're liberal and they're joining this new way but there are also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them so you get a guy like Donny dory sure you get all these other people say\nOr white guy old white guy old white guy even when they were all like\nThey're all old white guys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nHave Andrew McCabe said you'll get insurance you try to protest so loud\nThat you're going to get some medieval dispensation the exam shoe from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecturing everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his ... and all these old white guys have privilege if you really believe Donny Deutsch you would say you know Donna you've had a good run on TV\nLet's get a young person of color and give give them the same type of opportunities and wealthy ...\n[laughter] I Would love that that would make an ending they very happy very happy and he'd\nNever happens don't expect it now or\nThe we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in uh in California there has\nTo be female representation on public points at which point at which point I tweeted out none of the Pacific islanders all Latino isn't a black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be a lot of these words on there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want a mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look will be a Jew will Judy Kate who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed and percentage fashion of the population than there are so many different tribes with claims\nAnd reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're going to have you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be in that board because I'm not just a woman but I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white therefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves\nYou know a set aside on the sport or we're going down there and I don't know where the ultimate project for years but either people are going to say you know what\nIt's getting chaotic when we go to stop this and go back to the melting pot just look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're gonna we're going to go into something like the Balkan [noise]\nYeah well I think again it it was all identity politics at its worst I mean it's never good to practice identity politics but you see this even in the entertainment industry where we have an African American hip hop or\nBy Kanye West he he's the guy who has some guts I mean I don't really agree with us and I don't like his music and I I'm not here not might not my cup of tea but talking about breed going out on stage on ... ... s\nSaturday Night live the bastion of left wing progressive entertainment and wearing a make America great again hat standing on stage and this is how it went down\nYou know [noise] all\nThe little by\nLittle\nI Can't hear that I have a plan that version of it but he was actually on stage on SNL and wearing a make America great again hat he got booed he got he got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump so the left or will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans have been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage\nAnd they have worth and that's the kind of a revolutionary messes at West and others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people that will be patronize wide government the title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics\nWe always have to have the after its identity politics but it's all progressive so for\nWest it doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison\n'em and you're charged with sexual assault well it doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's in most cases or gender or your race you have to have the proper raise the proper gender but you also have a ... up to have the proper ideology\nAnd they were almost that time but how how do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today and they in group thing being all the rage mean how do we as citizens forget you know I have a platform but how does it out of regular people stand up to this", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "01"}
