I think we're like you said earlier were all about protecting women we all care about women but there's it's not that it's like the lives that the media is telling\nAbout how the right wants to hurt women and then I see these men going bananas about it and stuff and I'm like\nI don't you get like they are being manipulated I it's just so weird to me I ... it's a it's so strange\nYou know what it is Brennan as I Love watching them they they're everybody got and then they put themselves in that position how much further can I go you went this far will let me show you how far I can go these like the man feminist or whatever it is\nThat is the biggest weasel and all they're trying to do and for lack of better term is they're trying to get some and it's this whining about it that ... ...\nI'm a man I'm is just gender heterosexual cracker mail and I will tell you there's right now I Love women I Want to protect women are and I and and I want equality\nOr but I'm not going to bend over backwards to put somebody into a protected class like species is not the way it should be but it's ridiculous mandatory did kill us\nWell it is and it's yeah I mean you kind of hit the nail on the head with the basically there's there's two different classes\nOf of men are may possibly more but I mean there's kind of the beta males which you're just sort of like what happened to your masculinity what do you watch this but the ones that I was describing a moment ago or you know I just feel like I'm seeing all these videos lately of men on the left\nWho are like attacking even women on the rights I mean there was a video that I saw the other day of this woman she was wearing a Trump pat\nAnd out and publicly crossing the street and there's a guy behind her I mean he looks like ... seconds away from punching are on the base and at one moment she even said he says some make some nasty snide comments about nine eleven or something and she said actually my husband died on nine eleven and he goes good good he deserved it\n... and I'm like what what the hell happened to you like what is going on yeah we've\nLost the plot we've lost the plot talking to a ... he's a\n... the founder of the hash tag walk away movements so you've got this big thing it's October what twenty seventh and you guys are going to get together and ah and that's what think progressive saying as this Russian trolls because that's that's that's where they go with everything now everything's Russia's fault and and everybody's All right uh so tell us about what's going on there\nYeah so uh we're doing a walkway march on Washington weekend which is the twenty sixth of the twenty eighth and obviously in DC I'm so that's coming right up it's a week and a half away the weekend after this one

are coming to attend to dinner and people are going to be speaking and it's going to be really just sort of like an elegant way to kick the weekend off and then the next day is the main event the march and rally\nUm which is open to for anyone to attend 'em and I want to make really clear to because I Do get these messages [noise] more often than I Would like with people saying you know I Would love to come here march rally it sounds great but I didn't walk away so I don't think I should count\nGuys listen this is so important the people the people on the rights who have been conservatives your whole life or Republicans your whole life you are what we call the walk with\nAnd your your attendance\nYour whole life or Republicans your whole life you are what we call the walk with\nAnd your your attendance\nAt that march and rally is really the most important thing because all of these people who are walking away from the Democratic party and walking away from liberalism a lot of them are walking away from their friends their walking away from the family they're walking away from\nTheir jobs in some circumstances they need to know there are people on the other side who are going to walk with them that they're not going to be alone that's why people stay people stay 'cause they think if I I think I I hate what this party stands for I don't even recognize it anymore but I Can't leave\nBecause I'll lose all my friends they need to know there are people walking with them\nSo for those of you on the right who are lifelong conservative the Republicans come out\nTo this event and you see the walkway march on Washington and walk with those who are walking away and then we're closing the whole thing out on Sunday at the twenty eighth with a closing brunch and

about the people that are on the left in the right who are sick and tired\nOf of seeing the way that these things are being handled\nIt just looking at in the way the hate speech policy is implemented like on on the platform you can't even have conversations about that policy inside of the company without having your character attacks that I've experienced this personally\nWithout being called a sexist or racist or trans foe burners Lama like can you can have conversations about\nThose kinds of anything that the tenant of the social justice city all effectively without having without being attacked personally\nAnd that's that's the sad thing and that's where they're going to go I think in the future because they know everything about you right\nThey've got all of your information from from Google to all of these things and they'll figure out a way if they can't get you through the hate speech or this that and the other but they want to de platform you they'll maybe they'll come

and by the way never wrestle him\nYour body slamming my\nPresident phones praying to Congressman Paul body slammed her a borderline chairs how in the audience is like I said\nHe was actually charged with a crime and he's talking about moms and leading the guilty and he's talking about moms and suddenly\nFrame of\nThe royal sitting in for Lori Ingram I mean John Berman also took this one I Want to see this resonates with you at all you see I think well I Will share my theory with you in a moment this is John Berman reacting to the same bite you just heard President Trump saying\nI Love when this guy mark who's running for Congress in I'm In Montana\nOr I Love any body slam that reporter and yeah he was charged buddies I guess a reporter came up doing was abused will be will Bobby's fine we got thought Trump was tickled by it\nAnd said Joe on the stump John ...\nNothing like making a joke out of body slamming a reporter with another journalist was dismembered his fingers cut off three weeks ago and the administration has been dealing with that damage control trying to provide cover for the Saudis frankly that very day\nAnd that night the president's impulses to joke about an unprovoked attack on a reporter Ben Jacobs by the Scottish\nRight he's talking about Greg ... a ... D G n G unfortunately who was running for ah for Congress out there in months\nThat whole ah explosion of violence and hate we're seeing does a congressman in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump side comment I I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Lesley Stahl which we we did composed of ... or ... or a demystify that interview written decompose that we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show and\nLesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when ... when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tunes them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we\nThese midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term or will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think cliff what move do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nOr just moved to the polls is that the Democrats I Believe are behind this march and I drink at all you talking heads\nShould find out who's paying for their parents range who's trying to treat them coming or and you're going to find those Democrats and then publish it and that total change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into it in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly a an ecosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan\nIndividuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only the Caribbean but more\nI don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as a ... a Catholic migration refugees services came out with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers have emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way\nApart from the caravan we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals it's families because they know that their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you and they can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names of releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nGet into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call oh we lost\nIs that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out with also share some other uh reports with you hear how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in for Laura Ingraham we're right back stay there\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nBill O'Reilly here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled\nGovernment and presidents have very limited powers in purposes\nAnd it really is to ensure mostly our security and then to give us a playing field where we can rest opportunities and uh and and grow into prosperity as a as a country that's the primary job\nAnd when we start looking to the side issues or whether it be you know uh the Trump said something you know saluted a guy who body slammed a journalist and he's he's now equal to the Saudis cutting a journalist to ribbon\nYou up on on that the emotional play that the Democrats are trying to use in these midterms might not be effective given the difficult tenth out there\nWell I think the ... to ... in my view\nThe Democrats have no agenda mainly economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and the the murder of him and this tremendously literate tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know they're they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but as as uh what exactly for him and his the Democratic party's great\nAgenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do or pretend they're going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and\nUh now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls are the president's approval ratings are are surging\nAnd that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like ... [laughter]\nI'm sure did at all [laughter]\nBut now you gauge as far as the eye can\nSee anything that can enact anything they can't you know we revised Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate then send it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything\nThey will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia they're going to get the Boulder report they'll be looking into alleged you know alleged ... of obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things in New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announce that is your goal and you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that is\nFor which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue you don't get the broad based sort of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... that I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment of the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to ... three games a beta Rourke um\nWho is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say [laughter]\nAnd he said in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach hadn't changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime the tree than primary primary or a high crime in misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there was nothing there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the\nGun it still didn't hear the charge was the exact opposite [laughter]\nDoes that help it doesn't help that are over ... it was in a and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten voyage down with sixty two million and the bad guy thing but I you know no I don't take it helps him I think\nWhat federal work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in Harlem for the Democratic party\nI'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and and uh Eighteen shifting\nYeah well aside from heights there's very little commonality there that I think yeah I I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that trap you you'll find a laundromat put him in a corner you put you on the record year do you think the Republicans\nHold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take a house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nThey've gotta lose a number of races where they're at right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nomination appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations over us but I don't I don't necessarily believe\nIt it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think are going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\nMhm have you can always great to hear

D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came off patent December eleventh in that scene at them and greedy and that's in the little blue pill is now available on generic form available to you from\nIllinois better joke for awhile and here's a guy governor Bruce Rauner is trying to fix it and I want to I Want to let him keep fighting\nMhm great coal thank you Jeff and are are now want to go to Connecticut Steve what's driving you to the polls what's the issue is there one\nHow you doing I yes I just wanted to say you do a terrific job sitting in for the great more Ingram you're you're wondering well on her show and I ... and I love when the both of you are banter back and forth both on the radio and when I watch you guys at my tremendous ship in the hiring a lot of a\n... a spiritual and family things that you talk about uh I find you a a very inspiring they just want to do that\nTime I'm making me blush thank you and if I can keep her from pushing me down and knocking my ... my chair over it'll be great ...\nShe's smart for bringing your weight and as she got on a radio show on the on the TV show and the two you you have a you have a good chemistry it's very natural and um you know you play off each other and I think a lot of us enjoy that I just wanted to get like a very nice I'm you know voting for the economy I'm a Trump supporter\nI'm voting for the economy safety of the rule of law ... the only thing I think that happens but the president and I'm In New York so I I get it's coming from queens interrupting loud and beautiful and all of that and and how we can go off on a tangent\nBut I think sometimes at the valleys I sometimes I Would like to see the president you know dropped the fake news thing dropped the Pocahontas thing he's got so many good things in his corner or in his in his two years\nWhen there's a lot of people tune it when he's on the air 'cause they want to see what he's going to say or whatever and I get how your rally the troops and all of that but\nThe independence similar the Democrats that may not be happy with a party if he would uh you know show where he's been doing I think his numbers were come up I think he could year people and and change some of that perception because when he goes why\nYou know and a little bit less of the name calling and stuff like I said I Know that rallies the troops but\nPerception because when he goes why\nYou know and a little bit less of the name calling and stuff like I said I Know that rallies the troops but but you got such a good record you know with the economy in the stock things that you were talking about you know you keep pushing that you get some people that lightly turn in may say ... you know\nThings are you know this guy's right you know I look on line and the stock market you know like just go like sometimes they have the flag behind which is good we got to play ... sometimes some kind of something with things that the accomplishments\nThat that he's heard did it not just the Supreme Court stuff and and the big news dot at some of the little things that affect business I Will say though here in Connecticut I'm In the ... in business I think a little lost this year last year a lot of the guys that I work with\nIt's not as you hear the economic numbers that we would think that we would be a roaring over here but it's a little you know it's sluggish as we say the title cocked his dog it right here in Connecticut now it could be could be Connecticut\nA whole nuns and the economy and you know the ... or whatever\nBut um we thought a lot of us when we look at the economic numbers this are restricted it's good it you know real writing to us because like construction is going you know home improvement windows dishwashers remodeling kitchens bathrooms when we're rolling then you know the economy is really rolling right 'cause that right\nNow it's a ... I think there are some industry is lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I I ... and here's the thing that I Would say and you're right now is the time for the president to back\nOff the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesman Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already underway\nUh we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment but at the same time Steve there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effects of this\nAnd need to know that the a he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician\nHe doesn't fix everybody every aspect of every life\nThe only things as I mentioned to Pat Buchanan the two things that that people want from a precedent our security and prosperity\nAnd prosperity is best gained by having an even playing field where you're not owners sleep tax to regulate it out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited his powers are limited\nAnd I think the media and everybody else I mean why are we focusing on a journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post\nUp but\nWe can't control Saudi Arabia they were rogue regimes all over the damn world Cuba China North Korea\nOr some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap shoot and let me tell you they don't they don't you're talking about due process no due process their due process is well it's what side do you want to be roasted all well and from my understanding as well\nAs the the journalist wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but yeah he's our domestic Saudi Arabia politics problems I Know would be best advised the U.S does not have any interest in million these domestic\nYeah well it doesn't mean that that's beyond the president's ah of the capabilities and frankly beyond his purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we\nCapabilities and frankly beyond its purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad\nWe have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries all you can do suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough\nEnough but I ... I can prove it to\nMSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalists that may have been mutilated dismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records in fact they don't but we can only call them out MSNBC and CNN lead with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in this short and it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy with presidents the in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so\nTo push that narrative and to drive it to try to hit Trump it's stupid it doesn't work we're going to take a quick break when we return all of your calls what's driving you to the polls\nEight five five forty Laura Raymond ... sitting in for lower income with lots of cultural news to share with you soon\nI'm On Twitter at ... she said Ingram angle and be sure to watch the grammatical tonight ten pm eastern live Trump rally from ...
