should attack upcoming student loan debt I'm thirty one years old right now um [noise] what do you want to know when\nYou only know what his upcoming student loan debt\nAlright so uh four years ago to get a promotion at work I decided to go back to school and it did pay off I landed the promotion two years ago and now the loans are kicking in and if I would've got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying 'em off sooner but\nI Will I Am debt free uh two years ago we had our first child and we use\nNo you know your student loan that he well yeah [laughter] okay so I'm I'm not that free now I have my student loan debt the\nFifty grand coming up in the Seventeen months I got to start paying for\nA nice not coming up it's there it's just whether you've got to pay it when you have to pay it so what's your household income\nUh it went from only twenty five when we were both working to Seventy five now my full income\nAnd how much of a promotion did you get in return for going into debt fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lot over time in the past so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent increase my base pay\nIt didn't show on the paper called your check\nNot yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true and I both I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now of four hundred thousand between my four oh one\nBig assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I'm not terrible but I just want to know I\nI think we kinda wing assets do you have that are not home equity or for one\nUh I have a hundred thousand and vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollars\n[laughter] [noise] thanks for\nUs for like five five ... five Andy and Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nBy because there was a neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are you think they have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs in ... in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a uh the the operations\nOf the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... ... all and we'll be rented or we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it up\nTo him and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about\nWhat kind of a you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I ...\nAnd what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands of the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that\nAnd any of the things that the uh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you and your your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying and it's a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you'd stand you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kinda thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families or adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much in this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\nBecause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing him on his liability do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThe\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins\nGuy and um\nOkay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins\nOkay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but a whole harmless is\nThat what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest\nRight it's like do you know you were you were walking across the employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases\nFor sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and I have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you sign these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still level\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so yeah I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a

American I Apologize that this is something that you've touched on a lot and so I'm new to the baby fat and I know that number one we have the thousand dollar\nAmerican the fine mhm my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm fungus funding and how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you OK but um that's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years oh no never happened we really lucky we haven't been laid off you go in and they get\nThree years oh no never happened I mean really lucky we've never been laid off I don't know if you go in and they get home ... I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something ... going to work\nOn something when he comes home if they did get laid off so [noise]\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed pause on the whole told them want to make up a vibe you step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as well we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club think of it like Costco\nAnd then yeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away and um that would be baby step for and I do that first in a rough IRA and then I Do it in a ...\nSome of your income away and um that would be baby step for and I do that first in a rough IRA and then I Do it in a Roth T.

I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's quite a million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay\nIf it's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my main thing that you know we found out the beneficiary I doubt I mean he's a great guy by not worried about you know that it\nWasn't like I don't care as a guy doesn't matter of fact a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very unlike the greyhound on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange ... long you been married for a long you been married five years and then five years they've not address this issue that strange just wrapped\nIt really I mean they should you should address the issue that they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy on this is a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money so that whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say dad\nOr I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's like I don't want to be paying for something that you know not only that but you have fallen thank you\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yeah cause you to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I have a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings should come I called it ... from my company and yet\nRetirement savings said comes a thing called a ... from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as sad or\n... or ...\n... well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a projected retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total and I've had you know and\nAnd my question is whether the cat has a lump sum yes or ... okay yes\nHere's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone it's gone and I'm like if you live I or as long as you live it's\nGoing to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market so it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you get that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nIt's still you know if you die then yeah you gotta survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal and so you\nAlways take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good gross like mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nAh yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well yeah total total Matt where the assets house and so forth\nNo ... well ... congratulations how old are ya I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire was war that was before that happened\nA millionaire before my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nOr holdings patterns or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nAnd scientists home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool is I'm ...

[noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nVolatility is back in a big\nAs markets continue to get tossed around as more economic data keep pouring in and financial reports from various major companies are digested by analysts\nWhile key economic indicators are still showing signs of life in the economy along with a roaring job market and low unemployment\nThe fact remains that interest rates are starting to creep up in a big way and are feared by some to put the brakes on this red hot economy home sales in fact are slipping in some areas with prices falling\nAs mortgage rates have increased giving pause to would be home buyers\nAnd then some companies are reporting that terrorists costs are starting to hurt their bottom lines meanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to dig it heals into the ground on rates saying quote we no longer need to be stimulating the economy unquote\nIt is their job after all to keep inflation at bay\nThis has some on Wall street a little bit concerned as the long term effect of higher interest rates and the potential economic slowdown are still unknown\nAnd when there's a little uncertainty out there Wall Street starts to move in a big way now what does that mean for your money and your retirement\nWell definitely it means more uncertainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nRetirement planning requires a careful thought process that involved many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that's due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again\nNow you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows but the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result\nSo what do we think the right thing to do is well it's definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market so our rates\nWe think the right thing to do is well it's definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market so our retirement planning process at Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street we've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place they keep our money growing there are much safer alternatives out there\nAnd even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could\nBe an IRA or rock ... roll over IRA and inherited IRA or a four\nO. one K. or even just regular saving money and in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial and the state protection services we feel that what we do is so important we help our clients right here in southern Arizona take some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio\nWe do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customized plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall street risk\nSo if this sounds interesting to you and you'd

important than just a game so don't put your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market\nThere's so many risks from all sorts of different avenues especially right now there are so many economic arrests out there and talk of a slowdown we're seeing action on tariffs and trade wars and rising interest rates\nEven major investment from some of them are telling their clients to get out of the market and that we are quote in the last hurrah of the market I don't care what you think about what's going on in the White House or how the media is portraying everything when it comes down to it\nThe economy and Wall Street are going to do what it does on its own economies are cyclical it's always been that way and it always will and the fact is right now we're seeing signs that were near or already at the top\nAlan Greenspan put it best when during the dot com bubble of the nineties he said he saw quote irrational exuberance\nNow maybe it hasn't reached that far maybe it has you'll be the judge\nSo even if you have a Wall Street portfolio now but you feel like you're safe with your bond funds\nDon't fall into the false sense of security that you think you might have innate bond fund now I spent ten years as a Wall Street advisor and many advisors they don't talk about this but a bond fund or bond mutual fund or ATF\nThey all have the potential to lose principle value you may think that they are safe because they send a bond but unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street and it trades and it moves it has a price\nBut unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street\nAnd it trades and it moves that has a price and it's highly sensitive to interest rates so if rates are on the rise those bond fund values will go down and depending on how fast rates move\nYour principal value in that bond fund could decrease substantially faster than your funding yield in the last Twenty years or so we've been in a downward trend in interest rate environment\nTo where they almost went to zero in two thousand nine\nNow rates are on the rise and we have yet to ever experienced in the history of Wall Street what kind of an effect long term rising rate have on bond funds so what do you do\nHere at Mayfield financial an estate protection services\nFor over twenty five years right here in Tucson we have been a safe money retirement adviser our

listening to worry free financial solutions with your host may even further ego\nWelcome back to worry free financial solutions I'm Nathan Federico a safe money retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives and\nIs the wealth building an earnings phase this is a time when we are working trying to save and it's a time when we contribute to things like for one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet\nAnd should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building too well spending\nThe second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets into income\nAnd in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you were a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan and it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some call this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one pensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now\nMost of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in

had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees this is the power of having the right plan in
