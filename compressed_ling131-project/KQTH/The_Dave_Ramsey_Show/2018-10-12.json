Kavanaugh was ratcheted up thing where you could see it\nWhen we lost the civil the civility amongst\nEach other to have conversations have even a conversation about something now everything is a debate everything is a fight you show up ready to fight and I I I didn't like that and I don't like that I don't think that does any good\nYou know Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high here's my view of the Democratic party regarding cab now going lo is a step up for you you are in the gutter [laughter]\nI don't know if that's right either but I get what he's trying to do but Mr older you're not even saying let's pretend to go you're not even said let's get on the moral high ground you're saying let's throw down you want to get dirty huh let's get dirty you brought a you brought a knife to a gunfight\nOr keep it up to that up Mr ... keep saying that you're going to you know you keep doing what you do and see how the American people like this this is the number one issue I think for American November steam grill or what they did to Brett Kavanaugh do believe that what they did was OK to believe it was okay vote Democrat if he thought it was despicable both for us\nYeah or better yet maybe step back and say I'm not quite sure what to vote for anybody based on the way that I see these attitudes that are coming out here and I find it to be ridiculous I Do I find it absolutely\nTo be ridiculous and we're getting more and more and more and more and more and we're hearing things more and more from ... from Democrats like the Maxine was like the Cory bookers\nGoes to the hill today [laughter]\nAnd fleas up in the face of from Congress people and\nPeople like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but what he doesn't realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face when I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violent\nHe's right this coming from a guy who was attacked by his neighbor right he was attacked by its neighbor and\nAlso there was that incident at the baseball game you remember that\nThe guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot these ... who's almost killed he was showing this is for healthcare hit list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to resolve things\nNo it's not but that is I think what we're headed to at Rand Paul's right both sides\nNeed to take it down a notch I'm looking at the Republicans I'm looking at the Democrats we've got to have some civility and the fight that they think they're taking on you understand for a lot of them and we've talked about this before here\nWhich is you go on these shows and you you scream and yell at each other in the back a green room there you're talking about hey what do you do in this weekend as your kids you know the whole nine yards the problem is not everybody buys into that\nA lot of them they take it seriously a lot of them look at the WWE Shakespearean kind of cedar that's going on with politics and they buy into it and they take it seriously and I'm starting to think that more and more of these people\nAnd I'm not talking about the the\nAnd they buy into it and they take it seriously and I'm starting to think that more and more of these people\nAnd I'm not talking about the the average person I'm Talking to more of the board of the people that represent us are starting to drink their own Kool Aid and are more than just rabble rousing their bases that they're starting to believe some of this stuff and what is it going to take for us to step back and go okay wait a minute this has gone too far\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the conversation those were actually got trained getting their face ... who said bears some responsibility of this over extra power\nYeah let me ask you this let's just say for the sake of argument right that somebody goes out and does something from either side of the aisle that says something that that energizes enough people that they go out and they do something right they kill somebody\nDo you think\nAt any point in time that any of these people are gonna look though you know maybe maybe maybe maybe this is a little too much maybe maybe we need to step the thing that I don't know if it's going to happen that way you know one of the things I said is when I watched that whole thing with Jeff Flake and and several of these other senators and stuff for people coming up and screaming getting into their faces I thought to myself\nDidn't we just have an issue with ... and the shooting and it just seemed way too easy for somebody to walk up to some of these people and the anger that they had\nAnd it's a very interesting situation but civility we need more of it and I don't think we have it and I think some of the stuff that I talk about ah\nWith people is they are worried about the tribalism in this country they are worried about the way that the country's headed they are worried about how we're talking to one another they're worried that the tools that we have that should be fun and enjoyable\nHave now become tools we can go after each other Twitter Facebook all these things say horrible horrible things to each other with zero accountability and zero worry for anybody coming after you\nAnd that to me is not good it's not this mob mentality and mob rule is not good for anybody and it sure now not good for the next generation\nBut I agree with him I think somebody's going to pay the price the ultimate price somebody is going to be so pissed so angry so enraged by something and the fires are going to be stoked\nTo the point that they act on something and that they do something and then they kill a politician\nAnd we're like wow but it shouldn't be a surprise it shouldn't based on all the things we're

mom separated so I have a lot of mail energies in my home\nUm I'm married to a family\nNot a lot of mail\nTalking about your gender [noise] oh\nDid you see Trump's faith in their [noise] a five five forty Laura you see your face [noise] Trump is looking at going okay I don't know where this is going but I'm going to stick with it eight five five forty Laura the or the Democrats I think thought um wrongly that all they need\nTo do is mentioned the word race or racism or maybe maybe every election it's always okay do you support the Confederate flag how many times that we heard that question right\nSo it goes to the Confederate flag Robert relief statues none of that creates a one job for African Americans not one job but they beat that drum why why did they beat that drum you're listening to your health the radio\nBut they beat that drum why why do they beat that drum\nYou're listening to your healthy radio addiction your reaction to Trump flipping the script will it actually result in more African American votes for Republicans or at least get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nAnd make me feel that the guy that he can get to see my dad all the time like\nThere was something about when I put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made of Superman that was the favorite superhero and your mayor Superman case for me\nSo [noise] Donald Trump or as someone who\nDefied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is\nIs referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get transfer Jeb Bush they said that ah they're Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose and a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president\nAnd Kanye West I think as a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow\nIn a ... someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut they do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that ... brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West let's listen to\nPhase out of each other and he's someone to help him if the guy them and then he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras do get some help\nAnd then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative if you want to support Donald Trump that is your business as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were\nAt the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be all and end all and human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay he knows more than all the diplomats and all the people devoted their lives for this well I mean you could raise the question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room\nThey never raise the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room Katy Perry running around college campuses ... trying to explain domestic policy to students\nOkay he's people wouldn't know it domestic policy if it bit him in the back side will take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty ... we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans\nFlip the script this is a unconventional move and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go us\n[noise]\n\nThis is Michael ... than here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of many Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate health markets offers a free service with access\nAbsolutely I think I mean the Democratic party that I used to know has gotten hijacked by people who disrupt hearings up uh normally mild mannered senators like Cory Booker proudly proclaim I'm breaking the rules by releasing confidential information during the hearing\nAnd then you see a senators being assaulted in airports run out of restaurants with their spouses and just people being threatened and you know it wasn't a I think Steve ... police and Rand Paul compile be justified of this best but\nYou know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress you nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are they are more and more angry\n[noise] what is you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court\nAnd they can't stand the idea that a President Trump has now porn or two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a large number of probably the largest at this point in the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a\nA true that is a unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenger the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's\nListen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we need a Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care that ensures that she can he fails more on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she were important we see can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that [noise] what bank do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas I'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this\nAnd every other important area my only suspicion was he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left uh who are who are ah we're seeing a create these the sort of mob rule\nAnd Senate or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the midterms me you heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n[noise] well I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry the ...\nShaped ... latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see a down the up and the turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings of energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... and and Tennessee said well he would have voted for a cabinet shop but I'm the truth is\nIf you worked a Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn to send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking at this back on account of issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator\nTo discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pack\nThe incentive to me seems to be still\nThere for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report\nOr or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions at least now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nWell I have pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nAnd then a leaked that set it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing that it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the ... one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or um this cat's a doctor forge warrior although she certainly did the ... Dr Fort interests very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're going to we're going to get to the bottom of this uh uh ...\nThey'll probably be an ethics committee investigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that\nNames when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans\nAnd how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their tax messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics you know an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there's nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone is lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction the federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been a federal crime committed I wholeheartedly ...\nIsn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been a federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nA Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator or for the next to you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much I mean Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said\nThe president will win reelection you haven't had Nikki Haley things she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty or what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time Laura I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know\nThe mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think uh\nUh that it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh uh to the right\nAnd so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or\nA or a cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the ballot ask Jill\nMcCaskill exactly in Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time\nBut there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and uh I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry\nHis his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so and no one ever think that we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and you know Trump has it's near west in there\nYou have

that Kanye West obviously wields\nAnd builds on his cultural influence the guy is a big cultural influence or now you and I may not be listening to ... but their millions of people who are and young African American men who were watching him\nAnd that is in part\nIt legitimize Donald Trump among that community\nAnd there are some in the political class that find that offensive\nThat Kanye West would do this and that this phenomena is happening this is why Donald Trump the neck recent Rasmussen poll is thirty six percent and my bet if I had to do so today is that that's only going to go up that get ready for the call or let's go to Gerald in Florida I Know you've been holding Gerald you want to say\nThank you for having me I I Am a\nPatriotic American assertive which I Love my country

your voice about the things that you were concerned about\nBecause you do something well\nLike you know building a building or we're painting or dancing or singing or acting because you might do that

when I talk about politics but I sometimes think my friends and I have friends in Hollywood writers and directors and producers and actors and singers\nI think they flip through a newspaper or read a magazine article and because they know some politicos assume they have insider knowledge or understanding that dilutes the audience I Would argue they don't\nAnd sometimes there because they have a louder and larger platform their voices are heard more than others and that can obscure reality for them and for the people listening to them so with Kanye West here's what I said take it with a grain of easy salt\nListen watch it it was quite a show yesterday I got it\nWith Kanye West here's what I say take it with a grain of easy salt\nListen watch it it was quite a show yesterday I got to say
