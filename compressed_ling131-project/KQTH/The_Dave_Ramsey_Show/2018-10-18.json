we want to go whether it's a ... you do today and then a year from now we decide that's offensive or something we look back on our history decided it's offensive it's this retro rage that drives me crazy talking to brag embodied Andrew gender Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans it down on paper backwards it come on October\n... comes out on a comes out next week and what I'm doing on the Nineteen twenty twenty first America great from the start of your lives show is on the stage talking about are talking about these three Americans doors that wrote about as well as the two sports books I did it give people a chance to talk about what's happening in politics more of a theater setting\nSo we go to Brian kill me dot com you can get tickets will be in Tampa Virginia Beach as well as in I'll finish up in Nashville so they asked\nWhat is it that when you go on stage like this are we going to these places obviously or for Fox so you kind of have that you know oh here comes this crazy conservative guy and and and we're seeing more and more where people are coming up and and getting in people's faces but then you write something like this and\nAnd and you know we're hearing about you know the likes of Jordan Peterson and many other people going on campuses and and\nAnd disrupting when you go out there you feeling that kind of push back are you going to people that are challenging you with you know whether it be this you're writing about Andrew Jackson he's a horrible human being because he was a slave owner are you getting any of that\nYeah sure in fact uh CSPAN televised went to some book festival the day of John McCain's funeral this was still packed and I'm In DC and I'm going in front of a maybe\nFifteen hundred people and they said to me a favor safety questions at the end I a lot more to say but I said well you know the the promoters want some questions first question grade second question great the third question\nHe hates everything about may\nHave everything I've done\nProbably hates my family and I'm sitting there on stage and when it does it makes everybody feel awkward instead of having a probing questions they talk about wow how bad boxes how Thomas Jefferson wasn't really taking on Islamic extremists\nA meal Jackson did a lot of bad things to American indian so it's not like they want an avid dialogue is\nI'm In Washington DC were eighty five percent of the people did not vote for Donald Trump or George Bush and you just have an agenda and they can't believe the American people or me don't agree with them so it's not even interesting to talk to wake you up to one Williams\nYou talked to Geraldo Rivera you talk to die to Brazil did it's called the conversation\nBut yeah people are so angry now they're not conversations\nNobody's interested in conversation and people are looking for their thirty seconds to sound bite of fame that they're going to get on the Internet but the reality\nThe conversations\nNo nobody's interested in a conversation and people are looking for their thirty seconds to sound bite of fame that they're going to get on the Internet but the reality is they they don't want to have a conversation because you may come back with something they can answer so they want no part of that they just want to be able to throw the first punch and then run away and that drives me crazy about today's world\nBecause we're not having conversations Brian I like having a ... I had a dream or on the other day we did a podcast forty five minutes of dreamer was a great conversation we had a conversation about everything from sports to what he what it's like to feel like an American and have troubles here to his wife and his kids and all of these things\nAnd it was a real conversation we did we differed interviewer areas and we agreed in some but we never get to that point anymore because all we want to do was yell at each other\nI think that to look them I going to defend President Trump's riding a horse face for Stormy Daniels absolutely not I Am I going to defend a you know calling people out you know call me Rosie O'Donnell animal\nNow I Am I you know if there are some things are indefensible that President Trump does I'm not going to you but in the big picture I don't look at it get up every day and thinking how he's destroying the country\nIf you look at these numbers you see the economy increasing you see her defense getting stronger you see our trade deals getting better if you want to argue with me at least think knowledge what's happening and then challenge me and I'm not going to push back when you say there's a need to tweet personal attack\nAbsolutely not is beneath the office for me yes\nBut it can I tell you that his approach is America First in every way he's lost over a billion dollars this is by conservative estimates by taking this job\nHis company can invest internationally his son is being skewered his lawyer is being Jews ... matter of time has got to be jailed his CFO is forced to take immunity\nIs best friends office has been raided and now he's got to get immunity one of the ... who owns the Enquirer think about what he deals with an a daily basis they the Trump name is lauded and hated it used to be pretty much respected so why did he do it\nAt least acknowledge he's doing it for the country at least acknowledge that trade deal is that we can build another\nBuilding in Mexico and Canada at least acknowledge that he's trying to get a better deal for America he takes on the ... you not for his ego because he feels as though the trade deals are tilted against us and NATO wasn't paying enough he's not running from allies why can't you take a step back and say he's different\nBut let's see if he's wrong I Want to say let's see if this works\nNow I don't think people understand that because they look at everything is so emotional they and they decided to let their feelings or you know handle everything in their life and I to me I find that\nCrazy we're talking to Brian humane Andrew Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans sent out in paperback next week or you know do you think Andrew Jackson would've treated I think I think a lot of these guys would have gone on there and it was just totally been in trouble like ... like Trump\nJackson is a good point when you your regional question I did not do a good job of answering as how are they like they're like this they both were despised by the elite or the predecessor John Quincy Adams bronco bomber they both are not accepted as presidents or the John Quincy Adams left the White House before\nBefore uh before the before Andrew Jackson did even get into the White House causing a deer riot with a lack of security\nSo you as somebody who not like the case of the people Jackson was the first to campaign when Trump was not accepted by the Republican Party or a the Washington establishment he brought his case in middle America and guess where he want middle America he was a not worthy of the office\nOr or the Washington establishment he brought his case in middle America and guess where he wanted\nMiddle America he was a not worthy of the office they looked at Jackson going so poor that backwards or the Carolinas he used to draw in crew to be president he's from he's that Jefferson Monroe he's now Washington you know he's not Adam this guy's got no sophistication at all\nYou know he's a military general that you know he's good at that but not this meanwhile\nHe is the American success story he is the guy that was offered to Thirteen to volunteer for the revolutionary war that lost his two brothers during that war and his mom and his dad before he was born who was raised by the town that county the country who blood red white and blue and live to get\nRevenge other people that destroyed his family and that's the British that to American success story viewers policies one way but understand what he represented if you come to this country you could accomplish anything you want or at least have the opportunity to fail that's were not represented\nAbsolutely and last question appreciate your coming on today or\nYou look at this whole thing going on with a\nCause showy and everything that is happening and the way that Trump is looking at it and you know one of my things on the talk about or you know as I've been talking about throughout the day is the fact that you know Trump looks at this in a much more you know a macro way than you think we need Saudi Arabia as much as we don't like that and in some ways I'm trying to explain to somebody they\nYou know sometimes when we fight monsters against what we need we need other monsters and that's a weird crude way to say something like that\nBut that's the way that I think Trump is looking at this is it's it's better than than us when it comes to things like Iran and I don't think people understand that but at the same time what took place is absolutely heinous\nIt it's like this ... is is like a friend of yours who your trusted comes in Rob's everything from ... second I came to the keys to the house I trusted you left for the weekend and you're out there everything and they go yeah sorry\nYou can't that cake on punished either of his stuff is replaceable I mean Saudi Arabia with all its warts and all its problems and a and a society that medieval\nWe still felt as though we could trust them more and could understand them better than or the Iranians and together we were bringing Iranians economy to its knees and intern then goes defiant there goes the financing of Hamas Hezbollah\nAnd their own

forty Laura [noise]\nHere's an unprecedented number of unfilled opportunities so obviously you need laborers they're going to come from somewhere and as we all know immigrant employing about Americans coming back into the workforce how 'bout that would be how about how Americans and as we're coming back in the workforce which are doing like\nRandom they were going to run out of the openings but let

Obama are coming out of that you know horrible recession we've got all the stimulus son of stimulus ought to be [noise] I'm just I'm just wondering like we're we're we're the deficit hawks\nDuring the eight years of Obama you're listening to your healthy radio addiction eight five five forty Laura how many of you believe that this issue of these ... these huge caravans of people storming the border what's politically time they see the Democrats think this is a good issue for them\nI think they made a ... steak horrendous mistake it's a terrible issue for them the Republicans must stand with the president eight five five forty Laura let's go to Jerry in Pennsylvania on line for chair\nCouldn't\nSpeak up I don't know why are you guys are on bad phones are bad I don't know what it is but you all have to speak up because we all want to hear you so if you're on a speaker phone you can\nLike I said I couldn't I couldn't I handed over to more the Democrats are staging the so to say that mothers and they deserve and but the but I Want to add one thing if they are with you I think the uh we don't need immigrant ...\nWhat we need are unemployed\nI think you\nHit the nail on the head we need people to develop skills in this country the trades how many times you read articles that that we don't have enough tradesmen and ... and what can you say tradesmen any more people who do trades [laughter]\nWe don't have enough of of skilled uh labor's hand on hands on labor as we need that and that's where people from all walks of life all walks of life can learn a skill in your you can learn a skill after you've left your your current career\nAnd work I'm not talking about being up on a roof and roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every\nAmerican job is lunacy I when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did all sorts of jobs from picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more and I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey didn't actually people who do everything from sweeping the streets to caring for children they get paid for doing that work eight five five forty or let's go to Evie in Florida heavy\n[noise] [noise]\nHi Laura I again I think you're on on this than an American state situation as far as the border but at the you know an American citizens here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the border has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we are going to better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns or criminal element of gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population\nWho are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets this like no one else how many have you saw the frightening frightening display last night on the ... it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's\nGoing to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee\nIf the Democrats have their way eight five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\nI Believe that the easiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal I Am for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nUh being able to get into the home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever\nThe home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever\nAnd with the uh that are already having a priority on any old studying at the opening up you could wind up with a lot of our vets in the whole study which would be helping all the American and at the same time\nPut one hell of a wall down there\nA than other interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman but Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go out\n\n\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't have my ... I was getting so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and compacted trinity\nThat's our way and you I Can't even blame illegal immigrants I mean I Can't even blame them because we did this to ourselves or other countries don't do this we we did this to ourselves but now it's got to stop joining us now Michael ... of course former Trump campaign advisor\nRepublican political strategist he's involved in some of the key races\nIn New York he also has a great a podcast called still standing radio dot com to just go there are still standing radio dot com\nAnd you can listen to Michael who has a finger on the pulse of what's happening in this mid term cycle Michael it's great to talk to you I think the Democrats made a huge miscalculation and embracing these caravans of people who want to storm the border I think most people from all walks of life life across this country fine now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris ... a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior ... for the president he really is you know he's he's a Latino and his president or his parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I looked Steve as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain schemes gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and you're on the uh the ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and that and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see\nChaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or an embrace of illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nThere weren't any now with bacteria in coming towards the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years\nAnd you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it\nWas people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country\nAnd and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd you saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam anymore and Lindsey Graham was the hero\nOf German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates from the strength and the White House\nAnd the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised parts of the word and they tried to come\nWhen he came down the stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that over and over and over again and they're still doing it today but it's not working because the average man and woman working\nEvery day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health the radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration are shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot\nOr or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain the same that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration\nTwenty nine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration doesn't affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a given a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrants for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent\nLess so ... you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's very blue collar area and ah in recent year a year or so we've seen\nYou know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants\nIn and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them cash on he just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell ya in\nWestern New York and buffalo where we used to be a strong steelworkers town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump but\nMen and women here me these jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about\nAnd the Democrats in the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue talking about how important\nAre ... immigration to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're conflate against illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration\nIs against illegal immigration and and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if it got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nYou know and the problem she sees is it the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here\nIllegally some of them are now over ... visas etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly\n... if you can't even blame you can't blame the ...\n... says etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely\nRight a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people\nOrderly process of immigration is what we need but look the chaos at the at the border is is not dissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... in the aftermath of Kavanaugh are and the Democrats prefer that because if there's chaos you need more government\nGovernment grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh\nThe screaming in the hearings the uh the people running down the uh the always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people trapping senators\nIn an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed that people trying to literally ... their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans would lose the house\nBecause a lot of people who were not measured well by the polls and twenty six team they call is deplorable is right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought\nA non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a a skip the ... the birthday party after work to go vote\nOn it and and this time around

more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house on a course in in Congress\n[noise] what what uh when when you see the

in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth\nPeople don't like the chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nI think that's really on a lot of people's minds was just the radical a resistance we're seeing from the last\nUh the rush of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen\nUm most people I'm Talking to I'm to the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform uh we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was in support of that\nI'm so immigration up here in Lee high valued customers seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty's Susan Wild is they they they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman\nOr because of the me too movement the women's march and so forth are so ... what would\nThey tried to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district so that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is\nTry to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nSo that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but a\nResult speak for themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy in Iraq or see\nYou know for impeaching the president teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that's been made possible by this president's focus uniquely on the American\nWorker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks\nAnd smashing car windows and in a in raising the flags of other countries and America they want America to be a a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtuous freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nI think it's jobs not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that\nThe results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up and mobs uh we uh we announced a campaign uh our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this was the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which\nIn my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side as it is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth ... or ... I Can't wait to see you in Congress\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story began with that and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIt's already happening federal services to illegal immigrants soaring across the United states\nBecause of corrupt judges court cases creating writes in the constitution and creating rights to this er rights that birthright citizenship\nAll of it it's a it has fundamentally already transformed entire states in the country or the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar military a lot of veterans and now if if I were Comstock\nLoses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nIf she loses I saw some on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll well tell us that immigration has adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has I'll give you that a stat and just a moment a doctor my Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity and he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday counseling a Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post a is a was murdered\nWearing a Saturday council that Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's not Donald Trump falls Dr Christian good to have you with us out what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it just affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the ship the local tendency in and you're right when you have a party that is run by by them and uh uh you know those old ah guards that it looks like they are often from inside\nWhen I I think actually this um you know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out there and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know ... between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nAnd try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and uh that that'd be killed and and also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listen to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the Saudis because he loves the loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense [noise] he's doing this because the Saudi Government the current government is doing a good work that helps that are not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from biting and Obama and all of those previous president without states and why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um gum prince and the south the government is doing their heads making many fronts the number one is\nThey are helping by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThe fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they are helping the states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east you're helping big time they get on a the Iranian sanctions are and how Trump is putting those on\nBy living oil prices and and on all the stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about to announce that are very very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is going to be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the government\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons unknown and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship and so forth plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to\nFollow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration\nThe president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time\nAfter the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point well I think again mark ... America in ... in the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's the it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it's it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ...\nI mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about the thousands and thousands of people many of them this is an adult men or\nYoung military age men who are have joined this caravan in or being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally\nThat is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against its total lawlessness a\nDie hard to imagine what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas\nWhich is why the oil is go to this year's men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means ... but when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but go for Donald Trump\nAnd an historic on way and then right after that they start talking about the current events\nMarching to the board that of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic votes jump into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized a by the media and I\nHave no idea how they do it but I have no doubt that everything has it been eyes you pay attention to the states they talk about it for three days how the Hispanics voting for Trump in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know a problem on the on the border and then we have to figure this out and Donald Trump's days we're not going to let that happen\nAnd I think Hispanic votes water in Americans can see through this\nBecause I trust that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll put you to you that you have you're not going to be received by the uh the bidding filthy or works of the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nWhere we have to make alliances with people in in in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that and don't keep your eye on the ball\nYou know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American uh people sometimes we have to do that and don't keep your eye and the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA document Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy\nGet Donald Trump out there on this immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start turning out on moss against him and the Republican Party eight five five forty Laura Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\nAttention you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lowered costs dramatically you may be significantly overpaying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings you may be able to save as much as forty percent", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "18"}
