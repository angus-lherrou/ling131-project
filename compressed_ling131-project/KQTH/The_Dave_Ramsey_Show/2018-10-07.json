she's the perfect person for the Democratic party\nShe should run for president to after the break up by took her off the credit card we shared but nearly one year later I noticed doctor for it had been charging the card and charge\nAbout six hundred dollars worth of merchandise when confronted Dr Ford said she did not use the card but later admitted to me after the fact and after I threatened to involve fraud protection\nI didn't speak to her again until about two thousand two went forward contacted me briefly it's like um you know Barbra Streisand and I'm a Robert Redford they're like

mouse the and the hair and all of that and she can't quite remember I remember\nI really I don't have any recollection of anything else I'd so let's go to Christine Blasey Ford since we're talking about Iraq for the record of truthfulness and and this whole thing make no mistake\nAll of this Brett Kavanaugh saga here already cleared all the hurdles all the traps been through the hearings thirty some hours of hearings before the idiots senators before Dianne Feinstein pop the cork on this\nOn this doctor Christine Blasey Ford BS alright\nAnd uh nothing that she says turns out to really be particularly true which might explain why her mother her father her brother's\nNo one in her family will have anything to do with her because she's a fruitcake at least apparently you know I wouldn't want to lead to any conclusion I mean if I felt it was going to destroy your career by calling her a fruitcake I wouldn't\nUh because uh I require more evidence I've got a whole bunch of evidence though all these witnesses that she named to say uh\nYou know who brought Kevin ... never never met at a party at whose house where I I I don't know I don't know I never know nothing doesn't ring a bell those are her witnesses heck of a job right so here she is on polygraphs from last week she was testifying she was under oath\nHave you ever had discussions with anyone um Jerry attorneys on how to take a polygraph format\n... well there is an update on that that was with the prosecutor women out of Arizona Rachel Mitchell or who was brought in to do the questioning well\nChristine Blasey Ford's ex boyfriends says she helped friend prep for potential polygraph test Grassley sounds alarm in a written declaration released Tuesday and obtained by Fox News an ex boyfriend of Christine Blasey Ford the California professor ... Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault\nDirectly contradicts her testimony under oath last week that she had never helped anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was rejected\nAnd the declaration also said forward\nNeither mentioned the Kavanaugh nor mentioned she was a victim of sexual misconduct\nDuring the time they were dating Nineteen Ninety two to Nineteen

known this morning joke and really guys this morning and they were all talking to their kicking around there already laying the ... they're they're shifting the ground this is willy guys on MS DNC this morning on MORNING joke with the pitching sisters\nI'm there he's telegraphing because these are the Democrats you don't have to wait for the Democrats on the hill these are the Democrats and what they're arguing now is well this FBI investigation will be declared inadequate and we will declare Nolan void and it will not affect our thinking or\nA blood drenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man who has been slime by filthy his gang of gangsters lined balls in the history of American politics I think we'll I guess and this is my best girl sitting there this morning\nAnd we're listening to it and I a lean forward a little bit and I think my best girl said oh here it is here it is the ground is shifting here it comes to have you ever had\nPulled up the idea that the investigation is Jeff Flake and Chris Coons and others teamed up was to give her perhaps to Republicans say look we looked into this but independent third party investigative body [noise]\nGive them cover to vote yeah they they say they clear judge Kavanaugh will now by not interviewing doctor for it and not healing judge Kavanaugh as part of it FBI inquiry\nAs Dan Goldman said it's not really a full FBI investigation of the inquiry now you're giving opening to Democrats and other people to say well this wasn't a real investigation so how can you possibly they'll get that I'm certainly not going to change my vote from no faith than anything that comes out of it\nWhat he's saying he speaks for the entirety of the Democratic party as well as anyone else um is that they've already declared the FBI investigation to be a inadequate they're going to want to extend it until next year some time special counsel two and a half years later\nA it's not about getting to the truth I'm it's just not about getting to the truth and all they have an interview cabin on Fort they're pretending it's over and they haven't done in the news media is insisting that the FBI do what the news media wants them to do\nOtherwise the news media won't tell them that are they've done an adequate job now it's a Lynch mob a and unfortunately Lindsey Graham is Atticus Finch willy ...\nThe whole week long pause was supposed to get some clarity to it yes it while I'm afraid by leaving out the two key witness because although they did testify under oath before the Senate only cloud that further and make them more controversial when the vote finally comes up later this week\nNow they're talking about jumping the gun and uh you know little learning is a dangerous thing they declared I guess the FBI investigation to be over because they read something that said that it might have ended as soon as Tuesday Afternoon or Tuesday evening the FBI has not indicated that it's over and I'm ... and they're just saying what they're they're selling their muddying\nThe FBI investigation ahead of time\nAnd that's what they're doing a Lindsey Graham let's go to well let's go there they are\nThey are laying down the predicate here to oppose whatever the FBI comes up with and to dismiss it and say well that doesn't change we need more investigation more investigation and it is at that point that you will know that they are a lot I mean if you have an wised up yet you're probably hopeless\nBut at that point you should know that you're just being hoodwinked you're there fraudsters right number seven Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham yesterday he might be the Atticus Finch of this Lynch mob story\nPeople can look at it and then we're going to\nStand above [noise] ah I keep telling my colleagues uh this is the new normal got ...\nWho would want to be a judge in this environment and uh\nWe've got to turn this around for us to lay taking Kavanaugh down [noise]\nWould

Obama administration officials lashing out at the Trump Administration\nFor during the send out this text message and there is a great ironic twist in the middle of that let me tell you and all these left as the media Research Center the good people at ... dot org put together a collection of liberals responding to this and it is\nJust fall down hilarious it is a it is right these people are sad and they vote I I Want you to listen to this and that I I Want you to\nAround the city the city of homeless people and they're all coming because hey I'm a heroin addict in Seattle is the place for me it's like green acres and and they are they all go there because it's a friendly environment for heroin addicts and then when asked about it the city officials\nBlamed the rest of the country\nFor not doing what they're doing and say all the heroin addicts are coming to us because of our policies but if everybody else had our policies they just stay where they are and this wouldn't be our problem\nOkay that's probably a good idea what in what we think of that [laughter]\nBecause this is your there\nIs is what Democrats do well is it a great deal to ah do you get to all kinds of great stuff to get through obviously have the cabinet update grudge hamster really gotten to yet\nAnd the FBI too big a highly anticipated I think they call it FBI report has been delivered the follow on investigation and it's been delivered to the White House and the White House has it and they put out statements on then I'll get to those and um the uh Congress the Senate has been given the documents the FBI report\nBy the White House senators now have access to the FBI report Democrats who are extremely corrupt in the Senate by Chris Coons\nWho's been very corrupt person is going to go in and read it and he's going to take notes on it or maybe photographic with this phone if they allow phones in there and he's going to do everything you can to do a Sandy burglar\nAnd a leak as much as he can't strategically of course exercising a few cuts a two week to the press\nTo spin this for the American public and uh CNN or MSNBC will start getting leaks any minute now actually they have to wait until the number of senators have a view of the documents so it's not too obvious who leaked it\nThey have to let some Democrats and some Republicans they're taking turns going into a secure room maybe they're not allowed to bring phones and but they're not allowed to bring Penn so they can write notes and they're going to come late come to the press\nBut the Democrats decided ahead of time before the FBI investigation started ... when they were calling for an FBI investigation they knew already that it was inadequate that it would not meet their requirements they would have to reject it which is what the plan is for today and the media will help them with that\n[noise] so we have the FBI or reports ah which will start leaking any minute now turned over your egg timers the Democrats are being given access to it [noise] it's not for public release but be dastardly\nDemocrats will be filling it out all over the much about the whole thing about just a sentence or two that they believe will help their ...

hysteria you know there were a few people on the Internet somewhere during the Obama years saying Obama's going to declare martial law and the un vehicles have been seeing an flatbed trucks on I Ninety five and now they're being shipped to Bosnia but never mind that and uh and all this you know this historical stuff\nBut that was fringe you know Internet stuff that says mainstream Oscar award

guy\nGives you a flat a bit of a flat had Dan Pfeiffer he uh is a fool and he has a Twitter account\nSo he likes to take to Twitter to let everyone know what a fully as and he tweeted out yesterday it gets tiring saying this but the right would go bananas if Obama texted every phone in America America simultaneously\nFox would cover nothing else for a month that's Dan ... he's a senior communications official in the Obama writes\nA only one little problem with that because it was Brock Obama that created the systems and if you go you have to search hard but you can find that the Reuters news agency buried in a story pointed out\nPresident Morocco Obama signed a law in two thousand sixteen requiring female to create a system allowing the president to send cellphone alerts regarding public safety emergencies\nSo it's his own stupid president that stupid Dan Pfeiffer is too stupid to know put together this stupid plan to takes everybody stupid text and a and this is what

that specializes in building retirement income is so important to your financial health especially as you are near or already in retirement\nAt Mayfield financial NSA protection services for over twenty five years we have specialized in creating safe income strategies for our clients\nWe oversee more than one hundred million dollars in safe money client funds right here in Tucson and have over one thousand clients that enjoy our retirement income planning strategies\nSo what do we do and why to our clients love us it's pretty simple we are safe money advisors and for that certain part of your portfolio we do not recommend or use any strategies or investments that have a potential to lose money from stock market risk\nWe have never had to have a conversation with any of our clients about why they lost money do the stock market performance\nNo of course we're more than just one trick pony is over here and Mayfield financial over the years we have assembled an entire team a financial specialists that can take care of everything you need in the financial world in retirement\nBut here at Mayfield financial we believe and know that getting this first part of your retirement plan the safe money income part is so crucial so we focus entirely on that\nAsked safe money specialists in the financial world we can help you turn that part of your retirement portfolio into what it needs to be in retirement and that is\nIncome income that last one that grows and is protected and now it doesn't have to be income that starts right now some of the best planning takes place about five years before you need to start to use your nest egg in retirement before you start to need to get that income\nSome call it the retirement danger zone and that's about five years before and after you retire that's the time where it's most important to look for and speak with their retirement income specialists\nOne that can create a guaranteed income stream and protect your retirement from stock market losses\nIt's about building a foundation of income from that part of your portfolio to create the income for that you are going to want to have in retirement one that will take care of your essential to cover your needs to take care of those basic expenses\nWhen you do that you unlock inability to truly have a worry free retirement\nThe second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets\nInto income and in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you were a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan\nAnd it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of them and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement\nEspecially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives this is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four O. one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility\nMarket and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money but if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that has no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey failed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they had the right plan in place with their rights financial instruments that provided safety a principal and guarantees\nThis is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four O. one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever to lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plants do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four O. one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nState money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive\nAll with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no conditions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just them\nAll time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get more information on how they save money plan could help protect your hard

evolution is right here in\nTucson John is president and Karen is the director of resolutions wealth solutions for women here at retirement evolution\nBut how you doing today I'm a man I'm doing great excited to be here\nAnd myself as well excited to get to show other road\nTo arrive me too and the first question I Want to start off with is what put on the minds of their retirees in the pre retirees his met with that retirement evolution this past week\nLouis and I think I'll joke but it is for that in the past couple of weeks in particular we've had a lot of clients come in and the stock market's been a little bit rocky and I think one of the common things suspend the concerns about the ... war or countering that everybody that we're having with other countries is so that's making the markets a little bit rocky\nSo I think that's a concern is kind of the unknown as things continue to move forward but some of that kind of pressures on the market have certainly been a concern in in ...\nYou're on known as things continue to move forward but some of that kind of pressures on the market has certainly been a concern and certainly but at the forefront for the folks who've been talking to over the last couple of weeks\nAnd I suppose that it just makes some people just a little bit fearful of what's going to happen to their own retirement portfolio\nAnd that kind of brings us to our topic today we're going to address some of the most common many mistakes that can be made one financial decision can really set sort of a chain of reaction that affects the overall health ever retirement portfolio\nAnd such is ever going to discuss those common many mistakes and strategies to address them so that you can focus less on finances and more on that some parts of retirement that's what we all like to think about I think that's why so many people procrastinate\nAbout planning their retirement so let's go ahead and get started with these common many mistakes wasn't money mistake that you see quite often I think\nOne of the big mistakes we the really is that kind of domino effect\nWhen you think of a domino effect it really applies to money matters especially retirement money matters because like you said Lou and sometimes just one element and can set off a chain reaction whether it's a product or an overall investment decision or strategy and that can really affect\nOther pieces of the retirement down the road so I think the first money mistake we should always address is not having a budget\nCare and you mentioned the word budget so are you talking about having a budget before you retire tell you say and set aside plans or are you talking about a budget while you're retired\nWell both actually so if you're not yet retired you need to gain and understanding of what money or funding is coming in\nAware that money's going on a monthly basis folks have access to a lot of different tools these days and a variety of apps like men ... or you need a budget pocket guard and there are other tools out there the states as well that can really make tracking your expenses pretty painless\nYou know I wanted to add actually cure and then to go for ... for this right away but we have an easy way on our website if you go to rent Evo map dot com R. E. T. ... map dot com we have a budgeting to on there for our listeners as well so that's also helpful\nWe sure do we sure do and for folks that have credit\nCards usually the company issuing the card provide some sort of any will spending summary or something like that that will show how much you spent\nAnd then they tend to break it down into pretty basic categories like dining and entertainment groceries gas so it's not always a hundred percent but it's good guide and sometimes with thirty thousand to view can really be Iowa opening into looking at your spending patterns over the course of a year and if you're being honest\nYou probably already know whether you're spending more or less than you're bringing home but the question maybe\nBy how much so that's why it's really important to track the expenses both essential and non essential\nSo will you talk about those essential and non essential you know the discretionary non discretionary expenses just for a moment\nOf course so essential expenses if we kind of think of map\nOf hierarchy of needs right we've got things like housing or transportation insurance food those types of things that are essential to just getting by\nDay to day and depending on how much of your income those essential expense of takeout that will help show you how much you can spend on non essential so I Know the way and you like to throw out those rules of thumb so I'll give you a budgeting guideline\nYou how much you can spend on non essentials so I Know the way and you like to throw out those rules of thumb so I'll give you the budgeting guideline okay\nAnd there is what we call the fifty thirty twenty rural and the idea behind that is approximately fifty percent of your after tax dollars go to those essential expenses says necessity right your housing your food et cetera and then thirty percent at\nThem knows goes to your non essential and then twenty percent or more goes toward savings and ordered debt payment depending on where you are in that\nProcess and this may sound a little tedious but really knowing your budget and the breakdown of your expenses both essential and non essential and truly knowing how much you're spending every month really does help ... foundation so you can reach your long term financial goals\nWell it actually goes along with guaranteed income and the concern is that some people are not exploring an annuity as maybe another place where they could look at especially with Social Security isn't covering as much\nAnd I knew what he as maybe another place where they could look at especially with Social Security isn't covering as much of your essential expenses as you might like\nDo you think that some people avoid inactivity and if so why do you think that\nWell I Do think some avoid them and that's generally because I knew what he has a reputation for being complicated and potentially high priced both statements have the potential of being true if you don't work with a trusted financial professional experienced in the arena of annuities\nAnd if you don't get the right annuity for your particular situation that I think some of those things that I said it before true you know of them being complex and possibly high priced instead take the time to find a financial professional\nWho's experienced in the arena of annuities ask those you trust for recommendations and do your own research interview before signing anything\nSo this kind of comes down to what type of agents are you working with are you working with the one who is captive versus one who is independent\nYou know I kept a financial professional is required to sell only the products offered by their company working with a captive financial advisor or insurance agent may limit access to the product services and strategies that are tailored to you and your individual circumstances for instance somebody worked for X Y Z company\nAnd that's the only type of annuity product they sell is XYZ company that company might have a decent product but I've got to tell you in this arena it's very very big arena and there's a lot of different providers and it's very competitive\nSo just being stuck with one particular captive agent would be potentially limit your options and when it comes to retirement you always want to have good options so that brings us to an independent advisor agent that has no restrictions and can offer products from multiple providers they have more latitude as they just shared with you to comparison shop\nAcross the broader range of investments and insurance options to find one that suited perhaps at a lower cost to their client\nSo again this is what I found for a lot of folks that have come into my office\nMaybe they've worked with their local property casually person and they mentioned XYZ annuity product it I don't want to call out any companies I think there's a lot of find companies here in town but that property casually person or that insurance agent then presents only what that company has to offer and then someone will come in here and they'll say hey can you take a look at their should we do this\nAnd then we look at all the various other options and they find out that maybe there was some better choices\nBecause here in our office we are independent and were license with multiple different carriers your twenty thirty forty different carriers for us to be able to start helping\nThe folks that we work with make better decisions I hang up so exciting yeah yeah yeah so we want it to do that and as we talked about before independence was important to us we didn't want to be beholden\nTo any one company we wanted the opportunity to share the best options available you know there is another important factor considering that is the standard to what your financial professional is obligated to adhere to as a result of their professional life since her designation so financial advisors who are held to what's called the fiduciary standard must\nBy law put client's interest above their own at all times being a fiduciary means they are obligated under the terms of their professional licensed to always put the best interest of their clients first above their own interest and those of their fur or their company which products and services they represent\nThey must also disclose all material conflicts of interest that arise if any so it is very important that you try and align yourself with somebody who has what we call ... license\nJohn I hate to say that I think that if somebody were not fishy I feel like they might have been around the ... [laughter] maybe when you get\nLike man I\nDon't know about that the job on the show isn't to knock other places and the financial or read I think getting help is always better than not getting how right but I Do think that one\nAnd the show isn't to knock other places in the financial or read I think getting help is always better than not getting how dry\nBut I Do think that once you're in that helping range if you want to get yourself maybe a little bit better position is maybe find somebody who is independent maybe somebody who can help you out\nAnd who's truly working towards your particular situation and and that's for each of our listeners to ... out on their own of course and I just think that's important that they kinda get the confidence in answering that question themselves\nOkay very good okay so that's that's finding the right professional now what about finding the right a new witty\nWell first of all many financial professionals dealing with a new to ease myself included suggest that only a part very important only a part of your retirement portfolio should be used for nudity\nThen we look at the different types there are what we call immediate and deferred depending on when the payments are needed and then the underlying types do you want a fixed a new what do you do you want a variable or do you want what's called an indexed annuity which depend on your knees objectives and tolerance for risk\nYou know if there are liquidity concerns an immediate annuity can be the right way to go where there is a is a leg from when you pay the insurance company for the policy to win the insurance companies starts paying you it's usually only about thirty days so you put the money in and they start creating an income stream for you\nFor other folks are you know a deferred annuity you don't have to put down such a large sum up front but you have the option to build up funds overtime with monthly contributions to add to it so later on you can get a larger income stream if you so desire\nYou know when debating about an annuity it pays to plan ahead and as we mentioned to work with a trusted financial professional well versed in all things annuities to help decide if one is right for you\nAnd given that ... you know star ability is to provide guaranteed income uh it is a product worth exploring when you're planning for retirement you know when I just spent a lot of time talking about annuities and annuities you know for some people can be a good option\nFor people that are looking to solidify their income picture during retirement but you have to\nAsk yourself the question is an annuity right for you and your situation and if so what kind of annuity makes the most sense for you\nThe answers to these questions will certainly become much clear what do you have an objective review of your retirement assets and your retirement picture and one of the things we can do here is provide this review through what we call our map processor meaningful asset positioning\nTo see if an annuity is a good fit for you and in your retirement plans\nWe know you're busy and so are they that they set aside a limited number of times to visit for the next ten to call today during our show five to zero three day nine sixty three forty one if you call right now you get a customized map\nThis meaningful asset positioning that John and care and are talking about together you will create this and you'll be able to rely on their professional\nExperience and knowledge as you plan your retirement so it is critical that you get independent guidance from a tree professional who can say all of your options so get started on creating this map\nBe one of the next ten dollars five to zero three nine nine six three for one it never hurts to get a fresh\nPerspective on your retirement needs and how it might even meet them\nCall right now during our show five twenty three nine nine six three for one you can leave a message in China care and we'll get back with you All right so in a new could be a good option for those who need it to address the shortfall and the budget before we go out seeking any annuity especially\nAbout our budget that we should try to understand before we do that on our own\nActually yes which brings me ... money\nIs there something about our budget that we should try to understand before we do that on our own\nActually yes which brings me turn next Monday concern and again this ties back to having an understanding your budget it can be a mistake not knowing\nHow much of your savings you can withdraw anyway for income throughout your retirement All right Karen I Know you're alluding to that four percent rule are you [laughter]\nYou know how like flu and we don't actually that's where we're going so well that\nFour percent rule is really more of a three to five percent rural it is a rule of thumb that were first to understanding how much you can withdraw from your overall savings portfolio each year\nSo your savings can last as long as you do\nSo I Want to jump in here real quick\nThe four percent rules just again to bring clarity is drawing no more than four percent on an annual basis and then that helps you keep up with inflation and its inflation adjusted inside your portfolio but this rule is really important\nTo make sure that your expectations are such straight in retirement if you're walking in the door and looking at your retirement dollars and you're expecting withdraw ten to twelve percent\nYou're going to put all sorts of pressure on the rest of your portfolio to help maintain that because that means you're kind of have to have that same rate of return or very close to it\nSo that your dollars less throughout your lifetime so the four percent rule or three or five percent and then again each household is quite different\nSo that's why we don't like to stick to these darn straight rules here in our office but it is a good starting point to look and work off of and it is quite important to their retirement planning process you know retirement\nIs a big picture and it's not as simple as it used to be we used to retire we had our pensions we had our Social Security's we had some money in savings but the game has changed and now is retirees we're much more responsible because a lot of pictures have gone away we're much more responsible\nFor what we have to put together and that's where someone can help you put together and periodically help you out throughout her retirement by revisiting your strategy so finding a partner in retirement to help you maximize your retirement assets can be quite helpful because as I mentioned there's a whole new world of complex set of challenges\nAnd these are challenges that you probably don't want to put it in the hands of just anyone\nRight so why not put your life savings in the hands of an experience financial professional who focuses on retirement means and I'm Talking about John and Karen and they had set aside ten visits and when you're one of the first caller's on our show today at\nFive to zero three nine nine six three for one you will gain access to the team at retirement evolution still going to sit down with you you're going to look at the big picture together talk about your knees or once your goals and based on that conversation they'll provide you with a map\nTime horizon or when you need the money what your overall portfolio looks like it's so on\nYou know we put stocks and a mutual funds exchange traded funds inside of a portfolio to help you gain the potential for growth and keep up with inflation you also have to look at kind of a bucket strategy you need to have cash available for emergencies and withdrawals\nThese investments can be in the form of many different things individual stocks mutual funds and preferably locusts mutual funds\nThere's also a great variety of E. T. S. and also what we called target date funds that are available some portfolios also may include real estate or so called alternative investments I catch all category for anything that doesn't fit in the other categories\nRegardless of category diversification is achieved by spreading assets appropriately across in with in these asset classes\nBut there's a very important key to the mix and the dynamics of this type of structure inside your portfolio if you are too conservative you'll probably miss out on the long term growth of the stock market and if you were too aggressive you may face too much risk when the market as volatile so good balance in your portfolio is quite important\nNow to determine the percentages there are lots of places that uh it is available online to kind of look up and look at what percentage is you have or you could really instead of using these tools that could be a little bit arbitrary you could sit down and talk with a qualified professionals\nWho can really be helpful and financing your strategy to suit your needs and what you need in your retirement\nNow with any type of investment product you definitely want to be aware of the fees though right\nWhich brings me to the next big mistake is not being aware of fees let's talk about fees for a second yeah no matter how you invest Lewin whether you do it on your own you work with somebody you do some sort of hybrid ice strategy there's going to be cautious and fees involved in that process\nSo some people want to do it all on their own because they want to save on fees but then a lot of it\nAt a gee there's going to be cautious and fees involved in that process\nSo some people want to do it all on their own because they want to save on fees but then a lot of as we talk about on these shows sometimes mistakes can be made\nAnd those mistakes can be tens of thousands of dollars or even more depending on the mistakes they make and it could be a tax mistake than what I mean by that is positioning themselves whether or not tax efficient down the road so when it comes to fees what you really do need to know though is what you're paying for and what you're getting in return for those fees\nSo if you're advisor hasn't sat shootout or if you don't have an advisor you need to find somebody who can sit you down and really do a full analysis the fees inside your account\nAnd then you have to start weighing out is that the worth what you're getting in return or is there may be a better alternative which maybe you could be taking on less risk but getting the same amount of return or flipping one investment from one type to another which has the same idea but has a lower cost because of the structure of the investment\nSo I think it's very important and this goes all the way into the four when caves and lots of other investments which you need to pay attention to that\nWell beyond the can't type investment products like mutual funds that the ... right\nRight so I just kind of just briefly touched on the inside your four one K. you want to pay attention to fees but yeah like I said before all different types of accounts mutual funds being included or investments\nHave cost and mutual funds is one area where it's still we sometimes see significant cost and we're not seeing the gain the gain is inappropriate to the costs that you're paying inside that fund so there are some ways that you can kind of move from mutual funds to what are called exchange traded funds which lower the internal cost significantly so I'm not talking about the cost of the advisor\nBut the cost of the position itself but you could move into these ATS where you have significantly lower cost potentially but yet the same return or maybe even better over time so it's important to look at that and look at your advisory relationship if you work with a financial professional it sure you understand any management fees associated with your portfolio\nThere's often the assumption that when it comes to investments you get more if you pay more\nAnd what I was saying earlier as you need to understand are you getting the value for what you're paying for but realize that every dollar you pay for management fees are trading commission says simply one less dollar that's potentially earning on your behalf\nSo you can reduce the investment costs that come out of your pocket simply by the investments you choose and the funniest for professional you choose to do business with so this is always an eye opening area for the folks that we work with when we do what we call a fee analysis\nSometimes people come in and they have lower fees that what we're doing a lot of times people come in and have higher fees but it doesn't matter if they come in with lower or higher it's what value they're getting and what they see the long term do they feel like they're closer to their goals and objectives and that's the real key\nAnd that's part of what we talk about in our map process\nAnd we believe everybody should have the lifestyle that they desire and the dreams that they have for their retirement and the best way that we see for a lot of folks who do that is maybe get the assistance of a financial professional you know someone who has\nThe knowledge not only in the investment world but also in the insurance world and all the other tools to help make sure that their life savings is in a well thought out retirement strategy\nAnd again every strategy sides with an analysis and sell if you're one of the first time people take call during our show today
