thirty nine hundred people I'm assuming it was a little less than that in buses and took them back home mainly the the the women and children that came in through the first wave\nI think the white I'm all in government was very concerned about their safety and security and they made their way into Mexico um some of them refused and so they went forward and as you saw in the news um that big first wave broke through the barriers there on their way into Mexico and went straight and\nUh and now the Mexican authorities are are dealing with\nThat yeah it's not going to share his very intense it\nWas very intense and I saw you down there talking to share a quarter she's a word winning investigative journalist and of course contributor to Fox but uh after you know you wouldn't you did that you're supposed to be on with this last week and you wouldn't you did that but we were to come on and talk about something that I\nI think we should be talking about more and more and you've got a documentary called not invade a coming out about the ridiculous opioid crisis that we have here and it is a it is what I Need support each gripping and you've got people like you better mother name Heidi rigs on their\nWhose daughter just died and you had her on and it is it is\nThis is a real issue we have in this country is there and I don't think people are or or understanding that when you put the numbers we worry about certain things that you know we're always over worrying about stuff and we step back for a second ... eighty thousand people died as you're from the flu\nHow many millions hundreds and thousands of people are going to die from things like opioids they're real issues that we we should deal with and nobody's talking about\nAbsolutely I mean the opioid crisis is probably one of the most\nProlific Lee dangerous situations that we have been in as a nation in a long time and the reason why is because\nPeople aren't paying attention to it you know a lot of people think of drug addiction they think of junkies they think of heroin they think of junkies or they think of people on a street corner and some poverty stricken neighborhood and they don't pay much attention to it this is a crisis that is affecting every community across the United states\nWhether you're from a poor family a middle class family or an upper class richer family economically you are going to be affected by this\nMore than one hundred and Fifteen people according to the CDC die every day\nFrom these from these overdoses most of them are young people and let me explain why this became so important to me and to the people who made this film this isn't just about putting a needle in your arm this is about\nThe drug cartels as well as we know the pharmaceutical companies in the very beginning there was a lot of addiction a lot of rising addiction in the United states the federal government's taking care and tried to temper that down as well as doctors not over prescribing but the drug cartels took advantage of this and across the southern border\nAnd in China and in other countries like Russia they're manufacturing setting all\nAnd said no and ... and every type of setting all that you can imagine which was used to be one doctor side of that they used to think of you know anesthesia putting people out this is the most powerful chemical\nThat anyone can imagine and now they're putting it in the drugs and what they've done is they've created these pills that looked just like Oxley caught and just like Percocet just like Xanax they're selling them on the street\nAnd a lot of young people think on by as an ex or I'm buying a Percocet or they had you know parties in college or in high school and um these pills become available we've seen these pills these pills will kill you\nOr in high school and um these pills become available we've seen these pills these pills will kill you the first time you take them if they're not properly mixed and they're not usually properly mixed\nI was talking to undercover DEA people in the documentary over fifty percent of the pills on the street of Ohio are\nFake pills they look exactly like the real thing that comes from the pharmacy but they're not they're mixed with that and all and heroin they're leasing marijuana now\nWith that and all they're trying to create new addicts so when your children are out there this isn't just about experimenting with drugs are thinking that your child might ... might smoke pot once or twice what they don't know is that they're being poisoned\nAnd these drugs are out there they're killing our young people they're\nThey're creating new addicts they are destroying a generation and that's what this documentary not in vain is trying to expose it's trying to show\nThe bigger picture of this addiction and why we as a nation have to stand up and fight for our children and fight for our country and you know really deal with the facts here who are the people moving these narcotics I mean over eighty five percent of our heroine coming is coming from that southern border\nSo even when we think about these caravans of people even when we think about you know the the porous border nearly two thousand mile border along a or southern border and what could be coming across there just remember\nThere are drugs coming across that border it's not like just say no in the past this is about you better say no or you could end up taking something that will and your life\nAbsolutely you know we talk to her bowling right after his son died and it was you know he said what you didn't have any problems in one night he tried something and it was a one off and that's all it needed to be in this stuff is ferocious\nYou know the wall I mean we hear all the stuff about the wall and my my big issue about a lot of the stuff there is the fact that we've got a consumer base here that is the biggest problem is we love to consume if there wasn't a consumer base than than than there would be a need for the talk of the wall and a lot of these other things and that to me is a huge problem here's\nHow do we attacked the consumer base because they're not seeming to get it and there are seeming to want more of it\n[noise] you know we need to start educating our children we need to start paying more attention to our families we need to know what's really happening with our society and why are kids are experimenting\nWith these type of drugs I think a lot of times you know parents don't really think of this as it's going to be a problem with my child and know Heidi rigs\nYou know she looked at her daughter she looks like the all American Girl you look at pictures ever she looks like the next door neighbor or the high school cheerleader or sports star and even for Heidi\nShe said it was so hard for her to believe\nThat her daughter had become an addict that she didn't even know\nShe would see things like spoons missing out of the kitchen you know and she thought what are these kids doing how many bowls of cereal kept my kids possibly or all the spoons\nAre missing you know she'd never it never even crossed her mind that her daughter was dealing with some issues of self esteem that she had met this young man um she was very young she apparently felt that she had fallen in love\nAnd he introduced her to smoking\nHeroin and is she hid it she hit it so well for him or her own mother and when her mother finally found out and did everything in our power that she knew how to do\nTo try to save her life\nIt just didn't work so from the moment of Heidi tried heroin for the first time until the moment sheets\nTo try to save her life it just didn't work so from the moment of Heidi tried heroin for the first time until the moment she died she only lived Eighteen months\nShe died two weeks after her twentieth birthday her mom is\nTrying to get the message out there and the DEA is trying to get the message out there Derrick malts Pettitte former head of the special operations division you know is trying to get the message out there this has nothing to be ashamed of what we need to do is start teaching our children about what's out there and the ... about the reality\nOf these narcotics you know and who is bringing them across and how these people operate and why we have an addiction so high remember I think you know you had people from the beginning of time\nHave addiction issues right I mean we're not going to be able to stop every one from doing everything that's harmful for them but where we can do is educate our children hold those accountable who are making\nThese narcotics hold those people accountable try to put a stop to them because remember this isn't just about gangs selling drugs on the streets this is about narco terrorists organizations there are massing hundreds of billions of dollars yes\nOur responsibility to because we're addicts were you know we have addiction and an addiction problem in our country but they're also creating these organizations overseas that are potentially national security problems for us\nAnd we know fat and all I I Know I bring upset and all over and over again but you know in March to thousands Seventeen I'll give you one example they had a sees Eighteen ... grams of fat and all that was hidden in the semi truck in Nebraska ready to come from Mexico City or from Sonora and they had\nThis powder I mean it was it was it was like for this it was seized if it was released an open air an open air\nOne hundred and Eighteen pounds of fat and all that were seized in Nebraska could've killed up to twenty six million people\nThis was during a routine traffic stop this was all over the news in Nebraska we had three thirty thousand I think pills sixty three kilos of powder containing fat and all coming across the Tijuana border I\nMean this is an enormous amount of narcotics that it's not only potentially harmful to the people that will be buying it or to the police officers who are stopping someone I mean you can do just from touching the fat and all\nThis is a very serious issue and I think one that our nation needs to pay a lot more attention to\nAbsolutely it's called not invade cancer Carter appreciate your coming on I'll do it again talk about something a little bit more cheery but hey you want to go to this or or or or check this out

but you know what you and and the whole thought as they want to get the young out there to vote because the largest voting bloc is that young generation but they don't vote\nWe've talked about it before we've are from the say yeah you can't count on us right we we talk a good game but when it's game time you can't count on us the vote we did that once with Obama and the second time around the enthusiasm wasn't there and yeah yeah we'll talk a good game but talking a good game and it actually translate into action\nMm [noise] yeah that's that that's that's that's gonna be tough and Trump is is going to be out there and he's going from place to place he's doing everything he possibly can because he understands what the state\nThey managed to hold on to everything it's a massive shock if the blue Saddam doesn't come even the blue trickled doesn't come\nAnd the red managed to hold onto it he'll feel emboldened\nAnd they'll say to himself now I truly been given a mandate because normally even in the best of times in these situations Americans like to check power\nIf the police and army comes the left is going to say we're going to go after him\nAfter investigation taxes\nTaxes taxes Russia Russia Russia and then eventually the big guy word not immigration but impeachment so Trump understands this he gets the fact that he is on the ballot and he's going to be

of non stop campaign tour with just a week left to the midterms it'll shore up Republican support in Florida, Missouri in West Virginia then over the weekend making stops in Montana Georgia Ohio and Indiana by election day the president will have held more than fifty rallies since he was sworn into office and even more fundraising\nYeah well it's what you do right now because what it does work really being present it's all about in any of these things is just how much money can you raise maybe that's how they should do it\nHow much money you've raised gives you extra help raise extra money so he's on the ballot period chemicals to matter what anybody says he realizes it what it means for him and his presidency if\nHe ends up getting his ass handed to him here now I don't I I Do believe the Republicans are going to hold on to the Senate and think I ... because there's just too many places that the Democrats have to defend\nWhen it comes to Senate seat and too many red states and because of that I like I Believe they're going to pick up maybe potentially three but possibly to one in the Senate side of things on the other side of things is the house and how many there are going to lose\nThat is going to be you know I don't think they're going to pick up any but it can they stem the tide and not take a beat down I think is the big thing\nAre they from oil wells admit that he is on the ballot it's one of the argument he made a time rally as base and get out and supporters to the poll it likely part of the reason you're seeing the president doing it all out campaign blitz holdings so many rallies in so many ... only defect Seventy yep\nRally Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly Reilly rally and there's going to be a lot more Riley Riley Riley Riley Riley Riley\nAnd and er during his rallies today is going to Pittsburgh\nAnd a lot of people are upset on him coming to Pittsburgh for for for several reasons\nAnd the way the sometimes the media has spawned is is that nobody wants them there in Pittsburgh the way that the people in Pittsburgh are are are talking about this is not that rabbi ... said look I he's welcome to your I Want Trump to come here she's been getting flack I mean it was his his his his synagogue that was attacked and he said for welcoming the president people me\nGiving a lot of crap but what they're saying is it's okay to come here but\nWe did try to get the message out to the White House that our priority\nTomorrow is the first funeral I Do believe that it would be best to put the attention on the families this week and the words of visits to choose from time to be able to do it our focus is a city\nWill be on the families and the ... reached the film this week and the support the filming to get through it ah once we get past that\nThen I think for the opportunity for president was\nUnderstand what they're saying I Do I get what they're saying is like look President Trump we do want you to come out here we do want you to be a part of this but they should be about the people that\nAre suffering there should be about the people that have lost their lives they should be about the community it shouldn't be about ... ... you coming out here and I was just blaming to somebody this this is the the the conundrum if you're the president if you show up there you are selfish and it's all about you and you showed up there\nIf you don't show up there you're an SOB for not showing up there and not trying to bring the country together it's a lose lose because no matter which way it goes\nThe media's licking their jobs because they have they're they're going to hammer him either way\nRight and he said look it at my schedule only permits for me to come out there today very case closed that's that's what it's about so this is all I can do and I think that you know what it is I think\nMe to come out there today very case closed that's that's what it's about so this is all

Trump or they think they're going to be in their big heyday if the Republicans lose the house like oh we we got we got him now we got him now but the hears about a minute what they offer doesn't work\nThere solutions don't work which is why Europe is turning away from the the orthodoxy of globalization\nOr they're looking back toward an idea of national identity and culture it's not not seeing them it's not socialism it's not it's not a in any way meant to be pejorative toward others but it's meant to say look we have our own traditions and we have our own beliefs and\nSometimes we'll work with other countries and sometimes they'll have differences but we are going to focus on the home front first and try to fix that and then we'll we'll try to see what we can do with other people to something wrong with that the idea that the that the international is out there and want to somehow say national uh understanding and in pride something bad it's ridiculous\nThat's far afield we've gotten today that you can't be proud of your country and say this is the best country in the face of the earth and let's fix the home front first you can't say that\nI say bull you can

piece in the star ledger which is one of you know I always call it the red Star Ledger so left wing of there was an editorial the other day um and the title was choking down\nHis vote for him and then does basically they know the ... really bad but because you're a Republican and you work for a pharmaceutical company made money on pharmaceutical\nThat you're basically the same person so you might as well vote for the guy the devil you know that's essentially the argument that the best that the star ledger can do is choke it down and vote for him and\nIt it's it's unbelievable and the wall Street Journal did a good job to put those in perspective those the logic that they had there and the sad thing Laura about the whole thing is here's a guy who's been in Washington for twenty five years sixteen years with a Democratic president\nAnd he has nothing to run on it's like come on you want is a job interview for another six years and I want to talk about how much attack the president I'm going to attack the candidate I'm not going to tell you anything I've done to help you with the people in Jersey were so over tax he's voted for more than five hundred tax increases\nAnd this is the guy that you want to re elect it's time for change\nWell that the amazing thing again going back to this pathetic endorsement and the star ledger which is still read in in the state is that they the star ledger trashes Cory Booker and governor Murphy for\nEndorsing Menendez and they say someone better could have run so that means ... again I just want everyone in New Jersey listening to this\nThere is no real argument for returning Menendez to power it's so corrupt in New Jersey that the only argument that they can make it he's not a Republican oh and Bob ... a praise Donald Trump in what is a one of his a chairman of your chair and finance chair in New Jersey\nWell I imagine people are enjoying the economic revival in this country pretty well and especially a lot of those a Wall Street or to live in New Jersey and commute into the city so the idea that they're not enjoying this economic revival brought on by Trump's policies as absurd\nAs people Jersey really differentiate on the fact that listen\nWe want somebody independent ... New Jersey at the short of the stick for so long it's time for the people in New Jersey to get put first and and not some party or politics\nAnd in New Jersey is lucky that we've had the economic revival in the country because it's being dragged along and and we need to do things in New Jersey are going to focus on putting our state the right direction and higher taxes more government spending\nIs absolutely thought the ... not the solution in Jersey it's the problem and New Jersey and and and and I tell you\nYou know we think about your children your grandchildren I have three kids my daughter works at your body over New York and my two sons are station to camp Pendleton in California in the marine corps I Want them to be able to come back to New Jersey when the time comes you want to raise a family et cetera\nThat's the role models the you want and and the and the policies make a sewing affordable\nAnd it it's disrespectful to the people people Jersey but people just deserve but it's time to restore honor and dignity integrity the office and that's where we're going to do on November the ... the\nOr you get all kinds of you getting enough help from a outside and I know New Jersey like my home state fairly liberal even though there's conservative elements and conservative kind of pragmatism in in New Jersey but are you are you getting enough help or you need it and if not and what type of outrage needs to be done in these final days to\nIn ... in New Jersey but are you are you getting enough help or you need it and if not and what type of outrage needs to be done in these final days to connect voters with a ride to the polls and so forth\nYou know ... you know part part of the reason I'm but I think we haven't gotten sport or\nThe Democrats have gotten a lot of ...

immigration any any country is\nThis no\nTouching them more than will say\nWell I didn't think the Democrats don't want Donald Trump talked about immigration [noise] the the Gallup polling on the the the way most people view this when questions are asked with specific [noise] do you think that people who come to this country who\nHave no legal status here should be able to secure a passport for a child born here [noise]\nThat polling on that if they if if the polling companies wanted to really find out the way people\nFelt on these types of issues you have to ask questions with real specificity because again most people are busy with their lives they don't really know what this means birthright citizenship\nBut then when people find out about it because Trump talks about it like what four hundred thousand people are born in the United states to illegal immigrants every year and it costs four point three billion dollars in taxpayer dollars to educate them and to give other federal benefits healthcare and so forth people are just like to watch\nI think it's outrageous most people\nIncluding in one of the most hotly contested Senate races in the United states which is in the beautiful state of Montana Jon Tester\nIs in the political fight of his life Matt Rosendale is with us\nOr this race is very close a record amount of outside money coming in to this race just over the past week another six million and outside money poured into the contest just over the last seven days making it\nA according to the uh independent record in Montana it's making them basically one of the most expensive races in the United states and uh we're delighted\nThat matched with us now Matt how are you how's it going out\nTheir outstanding it's good to be with you again lower uh Matt this is a Montana obviously is a massive state it's a lot of ground to cover so you have\nTo you have to pick your if your places where you go but\nIt would seem to me that the way the\nAmerican media have attempted to demonize Donald Trump just on the in the last a week or so with these horrible attacks and and on the issue of immigration I don't see Montanans buying that demonization and trying to connect you with that I really don't\nThey ... and I'm very proud to stand with the president his policies ... we've had him out here three times and the president will be up coming to Bozeman again this Saturday at twelve thirty or to join us again for yet another rally and I and I'm thrilled that he's doing so you know his his policies of\nTax cuts and trying to secure our southern border and reducing regulation and getting these trade agreements in place\nUm has been very very good for the state of Montana and and the people embrace those policies and they would like to send someone to Washington to help the president accomplished more I mean if we can get as much done\nAnd the last ah twenty months with with a Congress that has not always been cooperative and certainly the Democrats had been as much of a structure and if they possibly can goodness what can we accomplish in the next couple of years\nOr how much in a way of of lobbyists um money has test or taking in during his time in the Senate\nJust this is this is one of the things that demonstrate just how far from Montana Jon Tester is gone he is the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists in the country\nFive hundred and thirty five members of Congress we have one million people here and he has received more contributions from lobbyists than any other a member over one million dollars over one million dollars and why is that he stood on stage twelve years ago and said he wouldn't be encumbered\nBy special interests and now he's the number one recipient he literally bought a house with\nMillion dollar high in the Washington DC and left Montana and his rearview mirror\nAgain Montanans are very smart pragmatic no nonsense people and I think Jon Tester talked a good game when he ran and kind of looks like a burly\nGuy and he has put a plaid shirt on and then he comes to Washington\nAnd it just becomes one of the ... monsters in Washington DC and he wants to he wants to

made the opposite decision they have fled they have left they decided they are not going to run through the Iranian sanctions that President Trump will put back in place on Monday [noise]\nAnd there are other countries in Europe who are with us um and I am convinced that overtime or all of the European countries will come to see that Iran is indeed the uh the force creating instability in the

term but she's been there for Thirteen Years or so\nUh and uh she's leaving is ahead of her party well how will that change our dealings with Germany in the in the near term and what do you see as the political climate in Europe with the rise of solving any and the challenges that you is facing\n[noise] so we have many places where the Europeans work alongside us we clearly have some were um we don't share the same view the president has been direct with respect to the Europeans taking increased responsibility for their own security that makes perfect sense most European countries understand that\nThe primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia creates um [noise] uh reside in Europe not in America\nAnd so I'm hopeful as each of these governments evaluate this disease that America is with them were happy to assist them but they have the primary responsibility we hope that each of these governments will come to see that in the way that President Trump is so clearly laid out\nA CNBC reported yesterday Mr Secretary that North Korea is reportedly preparing nuclear\nAnd missile sites for international inspectors are what can you tell us about\nI Know you're going to go meet with your not North Korean counterpart just a matter of days but what's the latest from ah North Korea\nSo I Can't say much about what's taking place on the ground but I can make clear that when I was with chairman Kim now or three weeks three and a half weeks ago [noise] um he committed to allowing American inspectors to come look at a two significant sites\nAnd we hope to get them there before too long it's one of the things I'll speak with my counterpart next week about\nAnd then we do have the intention of a President Trump or German Kim getting together before too long hopefully early in the next year where we can make\nA substantial breakthrough in taking down the nuclear threat from North Korea um we're we're still a happy that they haven't conducted a nuclear test in an awfully long time they have launched a missile in an awfully long time but there's a lot of work which remains\nAnd chairman Kim has made clear to me are just as plain as a speaking to lower that he has the attention to the nuclear rise and we do everything we can to system in following through on that commitment\nI Want to move to China and Mr Secretary because all we've seen in in recent weeks nothing that's surprising to to you or me because we've been following this issue of Chinese\nOr stealing our intellectual property and bribing attempting to bribe foreign officials including here at different times in the United states I'm a business officials excuse me to uh gain access to technology a critical technology and manufacturing aviation\nUh and so forth and now we have this chip maker ban are in place a that ... garner and a lot of um attention on it's trying to I guess we're trying to target that stayed on a chip maker in China over national security concerns\nUh how how is that going to fit into our overall\nA aggressive stance against this expansive a Chinese a behemoth\nLaura a China is probably over the long term the biggest challenge deaths are scared of shelves\nA behemoth or a China is probably over the long term the biggest challenge ... faces our country you saw the indictments of a pen Chinese versus for the\nAlleged theft of intellectual property aviation related intellectual property this was a story that's been going on for years this is the first administration that has been prepared to push back against China\nI were doing so on all fronts so where the semi conductor beef it's it is it's it's part of a mosaic of our strategic effort to push back against this continue Chinese effort [noise]\nUh you know it begins with trade we want president has demanded fair reciprocal trade with China we've demanded that they not steal our intellectual property we talk with some frequency about the enormous violation of religious freedom a this taking place against the waiters in China\nA were very worried that China will put the people in many countries around the world in Africa and Central America Latin America [noise] a in a death trap\nThat will cause those countries decades of pain and it's a multi pronged effort on behalf of all of the United states government at the president's direction to convince China to behave like a normal nation on commerce and with respect to the rules of international law\nNow I mean I Know you have to miss the secretary but just as some people understand that our\nTrade policy or with China has had real effect inside China they already have structural a weaknesses\nWithin a China large but they had the weakest manufacturing growth and more than two years in China or in the the one has a a slid a manufacturing stalled or and they and their ambitions as a result had been affected but they're still lofty\nA and we ... we do finally have an administration who's now
