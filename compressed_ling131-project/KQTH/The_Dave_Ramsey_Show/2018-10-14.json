I'm not sure let's say a better dead or alive dead or alive I I was just thinking about that I was just new to learn about that because\nYou know that's the game that I play oh wait a minute that wasn't me uh playing that game that was the leading Democrat lite who gave us the bimbo are options and destroyed all the women that Bill Clinton violently sexually assaulted\nAnd uh that was James Carville he was ... when you see whether they're better off with Kavanaugh dead or alive there was a a schoolteacher in Minnesota I was reading the story yesterday calling on someone to take one for the team\nAnd killed Brett Kavanaugh schoolteacher and you know that schoolteacher will keep their school teacher\nAnd uh someone to take one for the team and killed Brett Kavanaugh schoolteacher and you know that schoolteacher will keep their schoolteacher job and then I'll be fine\nBut this is the violent murderous rhetoric of the mainstream Democratic Party this is not some fringe website\nThis is James Carville ... author of the member options author of the great line uh you never know what you get when you're dragging a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park these the the uh the the standard bearer for women in America and he uh just get us this one too and the\nDemocrats Kavanaugh's worth a lot is worth a lot more alive and dead\nA cabinet to the Democrats you'll see Kavanaugh is worth more to the Democrats alive than dead so I guess he's a dog whistle to their supporters is don't murder the Supreme Court justice\nBecause we're going to torture him to death because there are still after him like North Koreans swarming over a hill screaming like ban cheese with their bayonets attach looking to ban that you are nuts wrote because you know this ain't bean bag goes back as James Carville drag a hundred\nIt's like the Washington Post and a and this guy went into the Saudi embassy in Istanbul beautiful Istanbul haven't been there you should go it's a great city one of the great city my best girl when I vacation there a few years ago now and uh had a great time and his son both\nBut we weren't wanted wanted by the Saudi Government and uh he went into the south who the embassy in Istanbul and never came out\nAnd it's like it's like a Roach Motel that uh that fact and he went in and they never came up and it turns out that the the hypothesis is the theory is that the Saudis sent in a team of Fifteen men to ah take out this journalist ... right and he's disappeared\nAnd nobody knows where he is and one is one group says oh that kept him up into pieces and took him out in separate suitcases something like that like it's a\nYou know when Alfred Hitchcock movie but one way or the other guy has been disappeared\nJust like the head of Interpol who was apparently grabbed by the Chinese 'cause their economies and the you know that's\nThat's how ... other companies have always behave and they'll throw them in the gulag or or just kill 'em or something ... the bill for the bullet to his family\nWhich the Chinese do the Chinese when they execute you and they ask you to a lot of people they send the family the bill for the bullets that they use to kill you and your better pay it\nBecause they mean business right but the Washington Post their leader trail today actually broil aims Donald Trump for the Saudis snatching this guy in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul\nBecause they say that Donald Trump set the tone\nAnd now we have this big um and encourage them or something and it's just they're they have mental illness I don't know how they got all these people with mental illness under one business\n[laughter] and into one party but there's a lot of mental illness on the left and it's on parade boy is that on parade yeah so they're blaming they're blaming the Washington Post blaming President Trump for the disappearance of this journalist ... because they believe that the Saudis grabbed the guy and bad things happened\nAnd uh and it must be Donald Trump's fault and speaking of hurricane Michael which is a horror show racing toward the panhandle of Florida Michael pierce is kind of proud he's got these headlines with hurricane his mom sending them test text message just asking them to not be too destructive\nAnd things like that [noise] ah but I I assume there'll be blaming Donald Trump for hurricane Michael because they've blamed Donald Trump for past hurricanes\nSo they've got it's amazing how powerful they think politicians are\nThey think that Brock Obama can slow the rise of the oceans and that the healing of the planet we'll begin because he was elected the news media believed that they they sold that message for the Democrats and now they're selling the message that Donald Trump is responsible for hurricanes say\nThe Democrats affect the weather in the oceans positively and Republicans affect the weather in the oceans negatively that as a sign of mental illness that is truly a sign of I I'm not a a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist by any stretch of the imagination but that's a sign of mental illness you don't have to be I mean that's you're crazy you're not you're cook\nYour a fringe case\nThat's that's crazy stuff and and let me also say a lot of this stuff are hearing from the news media and the and the Democrats just a few years ago what is mainstream now just a few years ago would have considered to be it would have been considered to be fringe extremism\nThe rhetoric of the left the get in their face the dead or alive or all this stuff they these people are these people are a menace and it's not as though there is no violence that's going with it there's lots of violence that's going about whether Brooke Baldwin\nPeople are a medicine it's not as though there is no violence that's going but then there's lots of violence that's going on whether Brooke Baldwin is aware of it or not I mean I understand that really they pay millions of dollars a year because of the shape of or knows\nMore than anything and and she maintains a steady regiment of of uh teeth whitening strips she's a regular and those are her qualities as a journalist otherwise\nShe's not the\nBrightest tool in the constellation if you know what I'm Talking about\nAnd Don Lemon he's famous for being a a dumb one too\nBut that said also in the Washington Post today as I digress all over the place into cul de sac sudden than refine the main road the Washington Post has another one today there is a gubernatorial race taking place they the election is in less than a month and the state of Maryland the state of Maryland\nAnd uh there is a Republican governor there are by the name of Hogan and he is a Larry Hogan are very popular governor especially for a Republican in a very left the state of Maryland He is up over Ben Jealous the former president of the N. double ACP\nWhich represents the advancement of colored people and just don't call them colored people because that's racist people of color is okay but colored people is right out\nSo keep that in my ... Ben Jealous former president of the N. double ACP he's running against Larry Hogan Larry Hogan is up by twenty points\nWell Larry Hogan this campaign got a hold of some video a couple of different videos of Ben Jealous the liberal left wing Democrats I'm ...\nAnd he said some really stupid things on this on these these videos\nAnd Larry Hogan people made the public because you know you can laugh at the Democrat being an idiot and getting things wrong and sounding like a fool and that's all they're doing a showing video of him right\nSo ... and he said stupid things he made gaffes mistakes but there are huge giant once so the Washington Post is downplaying but here's the headline\nOld veteran weakens typed up the story on behalf of the Democratic party\nJealous accuses Hogan of bullying bullying because they are published videos of him looking stupid\nQuote a new low and Marilyn politics what showing video of you is a new low and Marilyn ... I I don't think that's true but it's what the Democrats say you know when a when they go low uh then they then they go lower I think that's I think that's the Democratic party saying is a\nMaryland Democrat gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous accused governor Larry Hogan of bullying which is a term that I think should be reserved for grammar school I think it's a grammar school term\nBullying him with the release of a new campaign video that mocks him for several gaps they say gas they call them gas including one where he said he's running for governor of Virginia\nWhich in case you're a Democrat is a different state altogether that's another state altogether and so uh Ben Jealous or again he's a little brighter than Brooke Baldwin I think but not a lot\n[noise] we will be running together\nRemoved from the White House said we'll [noise] jealous when you make history for president [noise]\n[laughter] you got to be the first black you know that are all in the next thirty one day when the governor of Virginia\nAnd Maryland who's been\nFor president then they cross it out of Virginia so they made a funny at and it's a funny\nMarilyn he's been jealous for president then they cross it out of Virginia so they made a funny at and it's a funny ad can we post that we can post that on our website so you can enjoy it and share it with your friends now they didn't doctor the video like NBC News does they they just showed clips of him\nMaking a fool of themselves and then they've got a funny graphic at the end where it says Ben Jealous for president and they cross out president and then they write a Virginia\n[laughter] because they're mocking him now this is not allowed because he's a Democrat and now he's being bullied and guess what he's got a victim thing to fall back on he's got a victim thinks listen he's a victim he's the victim of all of this jealous set on Tuesday the mistakes were due to the soldier\nThat he has had since he was a child which at times it involves saying a different word than what he had an intended to say these ads are bullying jealous at at a news conference in Baltimore there\nWhile I can take it it encourages the bullying of young people and that's not okay he's protecting children and Planned Parenthood he loves to things children and Planned Parenthood it's a new low in Maryland politics let's not lose sight of who the victim is here it says\nOn Monday the ... campaign released a thirty three second video that highlights three gaps in one part of the clip jealous says he's running to remove Hogan from the White House so it doesn't know what officers running for and another jealous says that if elected he would be the first black president\nAnd then in the ad there is a clip of Brock Obama throwing his hands up like you know what am I a shop or a chicken meat over here with us [noise] and in a certain segment recorded at an event on Saturday Ben Jealous tells union members that with their help quote you'll be you're looking at the next governor of Virginia\nSo I don't know I mean if you can't use that against them as a political ad that's the most polite political out I've ever said that's not a new low it's a new high that you see this is the old\nWhen they go low we go high and then they burn your car because there is a Trump a bumper sticker on it\nAnd uh it's amazing so listen to what he says here\nA stutter is like a speed bump in your brain\nAnd word replacement as a way that you deal with it and and he's right one of my best friends growing up Jerry\nWas I had a terrible stutter and he still has and he still has a center and it's a nice guy in the Roman the greatest guys one of my lifelong best friends with the center and it's true if you have a daughter and you start to start because you know you're going to start studying over a word like Maryland or something you know\nAnd you start to say and I'm running for governor ...

Arizona in St Louis in is a member of the national\nAssociation of insurance and financial advisors promoting sound financial planning right here in the Tucson area\nAnd now here to talk with you about worry free financial solutions and retirement your host Nathan Frederica\nWelcome to worry free financial solution [noise] I'm Nathan Federico vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset in retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nHave you ever been in a situation where you felt uneasy [noise]\nWhen you place to yourself or been put in a situation that's high risk perhaps just before you jump out of an airplane\nOr dive into shark infested waters all things I can assure you I never do sorry just not my cup of tea and I realized that some of their loved the adrenalin rush that can come from things like that\nBut for most of us we don't like that feeling we don't like to feel vulnerable or feel an easy about something but how about financial risks where you might financially feel vulnerable again there's those that like these risks and the gambles maybe they bet on sporting events or at the casino\nAnd then there's those that lead everything up to Wall Street where some of the biggest financial risks can be\nAnd the scariest part is that a lot of the time if you have an investment portfolio you don't even know what's in it\nSo for retirement planning you want to have the right amount in your portfolio that has protected and safe\nAnd then the right amount that you can risk it's about balance\nWall Street what have you believe that they are the only place where you can find this balance\nThey threw out words like modern portfolio theory an asset diverse vacation as ways to try to convince you that your portfolio is in fact balance the truth is that's not what having a safety first approach is all about\nTrue balance comes from having a part of your portfolio that isn't in any sort of Wall Street fun at all\nHere's the facts Wall Street is great at the risk game sure you can get big gains see huge returns when things are good but at what cost you've got to be willing to ride the ups and downs along the way\nThis is acceptable when you're still working and you're a ways off from retirement you're still buying and re investing along the way it goes over time\nOh is that it will come back it might take time but eventually it'll come back\nBut what if you're close to retirement perhaps are already retired well the stock market and Wall Street is not where you want to rely one hundred percent of your money on\nWall Street just isn't in safety business they never have and never will be that's not what they do\nDid you know that so far in two thousand Eighteen and yes we are still on the tail end of a ten year bull market run the three biggest point drops in the history of the Dow Jones industrial average have all happened in two thousand and Eighteen\nVolatility is back in a big way so as you get older you probably start to look at risk and a little bit different way than you did when you were younger risk is now no longer just a bunch of numbers\nOr what kind of volatility you can bear but it's also a risk of your livelihood or your future livelihood your lifestyle\nThe money you've saved in your four one K. or your IRA or in other savings accounts it's what you've been working on saving for your entire life\nYou don't want that to go away or have your four O. one K. turn into what they call sometimes a two oh one K. which happened right after two thousand one when the stock market crash and in two thousand eight after the stock market crashed\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial we don't advised to our clients to rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nAnd that's where our safe money programs here at Mayfield financial really shine we want a place a portion of your portfolio into safety and remove the downside risk completely for that part of your portfolio\nThe part that you need to protect and keep safe the part that you need to be there when you want it\nAnd then you can still have that part of your portfolio that you can afford to risk and for every person there is a different amount to have in safety or in our safe money program and then the amount that you have at risk on Wall street\nWell for one a safe money portfolio cannot lose money to any stock market volatility that's right it can't lose money to the stock market\nState money also offers a guaranteed growth options it has beneficiary transfer availability it can be held in an IRA or ... or even just regular saving money\nAnd if you're over fifty nine and a half and plan on still working most four O. one K. is allow you to roll over your retirement money into a safe money IRA the key of having safe money is that financial security that it can bring to your retirement plan\nNow we don't normally like to compare safe money to stock market money or risk money because they're two separate things they're designed for two separate purposes and we're not trying to pit one against the other so to save money still offer growth\nAbsolutely yes it does well safe money is no get rich quick schemes it does offer security and stability and growth which is exactly what you're looking for as you retire\nIf

is one of the most powerful tools available when it comes to growing your money there's absolutely no doubting that\nHowever that requires inability for you to ride out the ups and downs that come with it because Wall Street is one of the absolute worst places to keep your money when you need to protect it which is usually\nAnd anytime after you retire\nYou see Wall Street isn't in the safety business\nThey never were and they never will be when Wall Street rises and when it goes up that's what's called a bull market it's a stair step up at inches higher and higher and higher this current bull market is now officially the longest in us history\nIt's easy to get caught up in the excitement the games the trillion dollar market caps\nHowever just as bull markets climbed the stairs bear markets are when markets fall well they jumped out the window\nHistory has shown that time and time again it's easy to see this from past markets the crash in eighty seven the dot com bubble bursting in the two thousand one and two thousand to the financial meltdown of two thousand eight\nDays crash has happened quickly it's that bear market jumping out the window\nAnd when that bear market does come again and it will come someday believe you me are you prepared to see all these recent gains possibly disappear\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial safe money become so crucial to your financial security\nThe fact is and I've said this before on this radio program that if you're in your fifties and sixties right now you will most likely go through three to four more bear markets in your lifetime so don't let that threaten your financial security\nI had a client in my office just the other day and his retirement was just around the corner literally it was just weeks away\nAnd in his four oh one K. he had saved and contributed and kept adding to it and getting his employer match and everything that can come with a four one K. if you're lucky enough to have one\nAnd in the past this client of mine had seen their fair share of ups and downs but now they were ready to move that part of their portfolio to safety\nNot to take them out of the game but to provide that financial security they needed\nBecause in the plan that we came up with here at Mayfield financial was that even if this market kept going up that's okay with my client\nThey're safe money portfolio still going to grow gonna keep going up but the main goal in the main purpose was to protect that part of his portfolio and their money\nSo it would not lose anything if this market were to take a tumble\nThat is the key to having peace of mind to having a worry free financial plan that is key to that financial security that we all strive for here at Mayfield financial\nSo if all of your retirement is in Wall Street or a brokerage account are you properly plan and set up to have the absolute best plan going forward\nIf not and this safe money concept sounds interesting to you or you'd

gain you had in previous years so the worst you could do even if the market did take a tumble is a zero loss and his erode gain than let's say after that big drop in that big\nCover and the market shoots up thirty percent as we bounce off that bear market and have a nice recovery\nWhile you get about a Fifteen Percent gain in that year that's the power of zero losses you don't have to go up and

of resolutions lots\nKind of an evolution it's great to be here with both of you again and tell us what sit on the minds of the retirees and the pre retirees that you've seen this past week\nSomething that's come up a couple of times the sweet that's always interesting in that if power of attorney\nSo we never want to think about us not being here and we never won I think about not being able to make decisions for ourselves but the reality is we're all going to hit that point at some time in our lives and really making sure that you put some thought into what happens is what happens\nIf you get in a car wreck on the way home this afternoon who's going to step\nIn and make those decisions for you so I really think it's very important for people to make sure that they put those documents in place so that they get to speak for themselves when they can't speak for themselves\nGreat point that is so true\nYou know we're going to be talking about really key financial steps for people who are about ready to dive into retirement and all of this kind of goes along with it and you guys watch professional diverse before I Love watching them\nAnd every step they take prior to that dive is just as important as the dive itself right I mean those are all calculated and practice to get it again and\nOur topic today is going to be the key steps like I said that you need to take as you prepare to dive into retirement so we're going to try to walk through this tell us John where do you start with a client who come see\nYou and says I really want to retire soon I Am ready to exit the rat\nRace of the workforce and I want to retire or what to say to them what do you walk them through\nWell along with your finances unique to mentally and emotionally prepared for retirement\nAnd it takes focus so a client that really needs to piece together what they want retirement to look like a day a week a month a year of retirement what that looks like are you having friends over for lunch are you going to the movies taking painting classes traveling\nMaybe it's all of the above what do you expect will be the new and what will be the same then how can you start preparing for that lifestyle now\nWhen someone has a feel for what they want their retirement to look like how do you help them prepare for that lifestyle\nWill let users suggest taking the lifestyle for ... for instance if you've always imagined owning an RV and retirement you know I eat driving around the country are you seeing the sights visiting friends and family considered doing that pre retirement taken extended RV trip did you enjoy it as much as you thought you would\nIf you didn't then maybe you should adjust your plan and rent an RV from time to time avoiding a big financial commitment\nThis RV part is really interesting because my father who lives here in Tucson and a ... my father and I are quite close one of the things is that one of his dreams for forever was that he was going to hop into an RV you travel around the country\nAnd he went through a housing change last summer and he had to spend just a month in an RV on a property not even traveling around in the RV but he had to spend a month in an RV and he\nQuickly quickly realized that that lifestyle was not for him\nYou know the food wasn't even the travelling part but he was like she just couldn't stand the close proximity uh what was happening inside the RV so all of a sudden this dream that he had for twenty Thirty years he touched drove it for one month and he's like\nOh no good now what I Want\nThat is so funny he's like this is too tight quarters for me and I think it's\nThat way for any new hobby especially if it's going to require a huge financial investment and a big lifestyle change right oh yeah you get for healthy tests been or two beforehand\nYou know I Want to jump in here too because this is the one of the most amazing things that I typically see that there are certain things that like crash retirement and I don't want to down on anybody's dream about\nYou how many folks that I worked with\nThat went out and bought that RV and those things are not cheap nothing wrong for people that are showing them I'm not again down Ian\nBut I'm saying you have to be ready for that commitment because it's a huge financial commitment and that is one of the big ones that I've become almost a you know bust up a good retirement plan if it's not very well thought out so I don't I'm not against it right I don't want any or repeal\nOf the opposite I'm just saying that if you're going to do that this is something you've got to be committed to ... I just think that's that's a very interesting topic to broach the show\nSo understanding of the cost them whatever that does our lifestyle may be make sure you're realistic about it that you can't afford it because for many of us our finances are going to be pretty fixed and retirement aren't they\nExactly which is why we like to put together a budget based on your retirement lifestyles vision what is that what are the non discretionary or fix costs that you're expecting retirement\nThose are things like food housing healthcare those are things you're going to have to pay for and then we want to put in some of the non essential is your new hobbies right your new RV your new traveling extras like going out to eat seeing the grandkids things like that\nSo we are closely with our clients on all of this cost so they can get a better handle on those fixed in discretionary cough\nAnd so you know through resolutions I work with a lot of different women and all kinds of women we've got a huge variety of activities we like to do and lifestyles that we live but when I speak to the women I work with and we talk about but\nAnd don't forget that required minimum distributions are are MDs that may be associated with some of your retirement accounts in particular the non\nRafael race generally speaking many financial experts recommend that you're guaranteed income should cover the book if not\nAll of your essential living expenses it is really our belief that you're guaranteed income should cover all of your central living expenses you don't want to depend on non guaranteed sources of income like income that's linked to the performance of potentially volatile stock market\nTo have to cover all those fixed expenses you don't want your son chose exposed to the whims of the stock market\nSo if you're a retirement is getting closer or let's say you've already retired how much should have invested in the stock market\nIt depends there is no one size fits all or most of us will still need the long term growth potential that equities provide your equities help our portfolios last as long as we do\nAnd they help combat inflation so most of us will still need equities but we also need to preserve capital so that balance of stocks bonds and everything in between is based on your risk reward profiled\nThis includes your time line and comfort level\nAnd John I've heard some said to capture your stock exposure roughly fifty percent going into retirement so that you can preserve that capital you know\nThat's kind of an interesting one that you these decisions depend on your overall portfolio\nAnd what other elements you have in place like emergency funds that can provide backup if and when we have market volatility occurs again it's one of those things that some say to cap stock exposure which is how you phrase that Karen but I think that it's important that you know every household once you're nearing retirement you want to know what you have\nSo I think that that statements kind of a little bit of a miss read and what I mean by that is as you're getting closer to retirement you want to know what you have\nTo build off of and you don't want the exposure to the stock market to be very high within you know six months or year of retirement but you could end up going back in equities once in retirement once you have a plan in place\nBut it's how we know what those totals are it's really hard to look at what one has to do there\nAnd I think when it comes to your retirement assets and how to maximize them to provide you with the income you need\nFor as long as you need it you don't know what you do now is John just said what you really deserve it's an objective viewpoint from someone who does this every day working with a retirement professionals who can provide you with a well thought out strategy\nThat's designed to help you manage your specific situation and maximize your retirement income\nSo when you call our office we're happy to set up a complementary appointment that are from you can talk to me or John or another member of our team where we can help you take a look at the big picture\nTalk to you about your needs your want your goals and then based on that conversation really be able to provide you with a retirement strategy that is developed on your individual circumstances\nWant to feel more confident about your income and your financial well being during retirement if you want to know that you're going to be OK in retirement don't pass this offer up today we're taking six people if you call five to zero three nine nine\nSix three for one and if you save two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement getting on this customized map this meaningful asset positioning\nYou can go in and visit with them about your retirement again just called this number we only have an appointment for six this week and they're busy schedule there that the telephone number is five to zero three nine nine six three for one again you're listening to retirement evolved\nAnd ... retirement evolution when they give you their website as well their website is rats Evo dot com you can find out more information there are a T. E. V. O. L. dot com guys having attached emergency than be a factor when it comes in determining how much time vested in the stock market\nWell the goal of having a cash emergency fund it said it should allow you to avoid selling those investments had depressed ... gives you a chance to wait out that market volatility well still preserving that principle of your investments\nAnd doing this can help your portfolio last for the duration of your retirement well also help keep you out of debt in this way the half of your\nEmergency fund anywhere from three months to two years worth of expenses can influence how much stock should or shouldn't be in your portfolio overall also consider having a separate money market or savings account for bills especially monthly bills by knowing how much your annual expenses are\nHow much the guaranteed income won't typically cover you can strategically withdraw the necessary funds a deposit them into that money market this avoids market volatility or attempts to tighten the market as well as multiple transaction fees some people also recommend having two to three months worth of expenses set aside\nFor the very start of your retirement in case payments from pensions Social Security like or delayed for one reason or another\nNow if you need to access non guaranteed income sources in order to ... percent of your expenses is there some kind of a guideline for how much you can safely withdraw\nAgain it depends there is the for for central but with people living longer and retirement and current low interest rate environment some experts are saying to lower that closer to three percent or even lower\nThis is with the general understanding that the portfolios well diversified and that checks and balances efforts are carried out on a regular basis\nYou know no income strategy should be on auto pilot because of market volatility inflation health issues those things may really require you to be flexible and to switch tactics\nBut that's why you have the diversified portfolio plus the understanding of your central cost so you have the options and how you cover them options that allow you to be tax efficient and can help you maximize the value of your retirement dollars saved\nNot can you explain how you guys would define a well diversified portfolio what is it that you look for\nWell in addition to having a mix of assets that align with your risk reward profile I like to see that meaningful amount of cash set aside and an acceptable emergency five you know a pensioner four one K. and maybe an annuity\nAs well as tactical investments in savings accounts and tax deferred and tax exempt accounts and obviously this depends on the individual and what they are comfortable with this account makes gives you different\nTax obligations which allows you to mix and match your withdrawal types for income and attacks of ... manner so if you needed withdraw income but are about to jump up to a higher tax bracket by doing so\nYou know having a qualified tax free withdrawals available through a raw or maybe an age of say to keep you from making that tax rate jumped this flexibility enables you to develop a sound withdrawal strategy one that keeps more of your money in your pocket while still giving you the income you need\nOn a side note here there maybe years in retirement where your federal tax rate is that the Fifteen Percent lower and you might want to take advantage of that bracket by strategically selling some of your long term investments that has accrued a sizable gained over the course at that um that's not\nSo why is that well because most people at the Fifteen Percent tax rate currently pay zero in long term capital gains tax us\nYou know I think that's important for our listeners on the radio there's lots of difference\nSo and so you know we just kind of jumped around real quickly but we just talked about tax efficiencies which a lot of times aren't discussed in portfolio construction or aren't disgusted withdrawal strategies you know and that's one thing that's important about having a coach and retirement having someone to guide you along in the process the top athletes\nThe top musicians tech the top politicians all have coaches people that helped them\nWalk through because they see this stuff every day and they have kind of\nHelp them make the best decisions inside of their portfolio so retirement evolution we always like to be kind of your quarterback in retirement because there's lots of different facets to look at your state planning we don't prepare estate planning documents but we make sure that all the financials behind them and everything is constructed correctly and there's lots to your\nState planning and getting those questions and having an advisor who's used to discuss in those things and making sure that everything's set up properly and working as a team member with your legal team there is also your income construction\nYou need a quarter back there to make sure that you're making the right decisions about making good income then the next thing that we have to look at it as your investments and you have to have good coaching on your investments to make sure that you're making the right choices and meeting your risk levels and meeting everything that you need in your retirement from an investment standpoint but\nThat doesn't stop there you still have to look at your taxes it's good to have someone again we don't prepare taxes that's what we again have strategic partnerships with tax professionals here in town but at the same point a lot of your investments can kick out taxation\nSo you need to have a good strategy between the quarterback and those other folks that we use from the tax side unless of course has health insurance planning\nAnd Karen discuss that a lot with the folks we work with in our office from Medicare and also pre Medicare so under sixty five type coverage just what you need a quarterback and all those areas and what you don't want to do is have six quarterbacks and what I mean by that is six quarterbacks but no one's talking together so that's what we look at in that process\nAnd so today John and Karen are offering you a customized retirement plan for you they'll talk with you about your retirement you just give them a call you can set up an appointment and go in
