let's go ahead you know rock Obama said he's an American not a Nazi American but you can add the word Nazi in front of it and then say well what your what would be really controversial is if what he meant to say was that he's not see American\nBecause he slaughters babies by the millions\nAnd rips out their guts any flushes with them now now I could add words to all kinds of speeches that Hillary

Bangladesh not technically geographically the middle east but close enough and they're they're not coming from Central America well they are but originally from Bangladesh and all that stuff\nSo he

an asset in retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nVolatility is back in a big way as markets continue\nTo get tossed around out more economic data keep pouring in and financial reports from various major companies are digested by analysts\nWhile key economic indicators are still showing signs of life in the economy along with a roaring job market and low unemployment\nThe fact remains that interest rates are starting to creep up in a big way and are feared by some to put the brakes on this red hot economy home sales in fact are slipping in some areas with prices falling\nAs mortgage rates have increased giving pause to would be home buyers\nAnd then some companies are reporting that terrorists costs are starting to hurt their bottom line meanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to dig it heals end of the ground on rates saying quote we no longer need to be stimulating the economy unquote\nIt is their job after all to keep inflation at bay\nThis has some on Wall street a little bit concerned as the long term effect of higher interest rates and the potential economic slowdown are still unknown\nAnd when there's a little uncertainty out there Wall Street starts to move in a big way now what does that mean for your money and your retirement\nWell definitely it means more uncertainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street retirement\nIt's a plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nRetirement planning requires a careful thought process that involves many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that's due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again now you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows\nBut the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result so what do we think the right thing to do is well it's definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market\nSo our retirement planning process at Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street\nWe've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place they keep our money growing there are much safer alternatives out there and even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could be\nAn IRA or a rock ... roll over IRA and inherited IRA or for\nOh one K. or even just regular saving money\nAnd in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial and the state protection services we feel that what we do is so important we help our clients right here in southern Arizona takes some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio\nWe do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customize plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall street risk\nSo if

your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market\nThere's so many risks from all sorts of different avenues especially right now there are so many economic wrists out there and talk of a slowdown we're seeing action on tariffs and trade wars and rising interest rates\nEven major investment from some of them are telling their clients to get out of the market and that we are quote in the last hurrah of the market I don't care what you think about what's going on in the White House or how the media is portraying everything when it comes down to it\nThe economy and Wall Street are going to do what it does on its own\nEconomies are cyclical it's always been that way and it always will and the fact is right now we're seeing signs that were near or already at the top\nAlan Greenspan put it best when during the dot com bubble of the nineties he said he saw quote irrational exuberance\nNow maybe it hasn't reached that far maybe it has you'll be the judge\nSo even if you have a Wall Street portfolio now but you feel like you're safe with your bond funds\nDon't fall into the false sense of security that you think you might have innate bond fund now I spent ten years as a Wall Street advisor and many advisors they don't talk about this but a bond fund or a bond mutual fund or each yes\nThey all have the potential to lose principle value you may think that they are safe because they send a bond but unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street\nAnd it trades and it moves that has a price and it's highly sensitive to interest rates so if rates are on the rise\nThose bond fund values will go down and depending on how fast rates move your principal value in that bond fund could decrease substantially faster than your funding yield in the last Twenty years or so we've been in a downward trending interest rate environment\nTo where they almost went to zero in two thousand nine\nNow rates are on the rise and we have yet to ever experience in the history of Wall Street what kind of an effect long term rising rate have on bond funds so what do you do\nHere at Mayfield financial and the state protection services for over twenty five years right

retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives the first is\nThe wealth building an earnings phase this is a time when we are working trying to save and it's a time when we contribute to things like for a one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet\nAnd should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building to wealth spending\nThe second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert\nMoney in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets\nInto income and in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you're a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan\nAnd it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement\nEspecially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives this is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case in IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they had the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees this is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial in a safe protection services this is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years and we believe\nServices this is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four O. one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever to lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plans do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive all with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no conditions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late\nTake action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get

welcome to retirement evolved repairing damaged in today every time an evolution is right here in Tucson Jared is the director of resolutions wealth solutions for women here at retirement evolution and she's also the Medicare and the health insurance specialist care and it's great to be here with you today\nWhat's been on the minds of the retirees this past week have retirement evolution\n... definitely open enrollment season or Medicare that as heads and I'm getting\nLots and lots of phone calls\nAn appointment about changes in Medicare just in our market so some people may be losing their plan and they've got to pick a new plan some people are seeing rate increases in their plan everybody is wondering what's gonna happen with the part B premium for two thousand uh Nineteen\nAnd of course lots of questions about how are my\nDrug is going to be covered starting in January so we're really working closely with folks to make\nLots of questions about how are my drugs going to be covered starting in January so we're really working closely with folks to make sure that they are going to be set for two thousand Nineteen\nKaren are there are lots of changes with the drug part of the insurance\nThere really are there are changes every year so I think people don't always understand that the drug plans can change so the way your plan may have coverage or medication slashed year may not be the same moving forward and we always want to make sure we avoid any nasty surprises\nMoving in to the new year because this is the one time of year that you can make those changes to your plan\nRight okay good to know so Karen is the person to get a hold of their retirement evolution is I'm going to just give me your phone number out right now in case somebody does have questions care and they can call us five to zero three nine nine sixty three forty one\nAgain you can call care and you could ask her questions about Medicare and you can go and visit with her view like that any type of health insurance five to zero three nine nine six three for one they were going to be talking about what if\nWe live and tell one hundred years old and has been for such a can top but I Know so many people are living that long now isn't it amazing it's amazing in fact recently and Italian woman her name was Emma ... died peacefully in a rocking chair at age one hundred and Seventeen\nShe was not sick she just passed away peacefully and not only listen to this was she the world's oldest person that em I was the last known person to have been born in the Eighteen hundreds\nOf crazy I think that's even ... and the changes that she has seen in her life [laughter] I mean she's basically seen to industrial revolution right she really ... yeah\nSo that's what we're going to talk about today we're going to be talking about whether or not\nYou are prepared to live that long are you prepared to become a centenarian that somebody who turns one hundred years old so care and you're going to help us by showing us ways we can prepare financially today for this possibility\nIs difficult carriage encourage people that they need to prepare for something that's a far office may be living in ... or one hundred well it can\nDefinitely be a challenging conversation because in the past we really looked at planning for retirement for about\nTwenty to Thirty years at the outside and and now we're looking at planning into a hundred or beyond so I certainly let people know that the odds of you living to be a hundred or increasing and you're going to face all kinds of risks\nOver the course of the lifetime you've got to risk of losing a home dying prematurely being disabled and unable to work being in a fender bender into your car the list goes on and on as far as risks that were exposed to but for people headed towards retirement or if they're already there living a long life sounds like a reward\nBut it also presents a genuine risk what we in the financial business called longevity risk\nSo it's a really good idea for people to make sure that they protect themselves\nFrom the other risks that I mentioned right your car insurance you have homeowner's insurance those kinds of things but in retirement it's also a good idea for people to protect themselves from this longevity risk\nThis chance that she'll run out of money if you live a long life so we're really talking about here is building your\nOwn longevity insurance or your own longevity strategy because the fact of the matter is people are living longer\nAnd that means they may need to have more money to fund that longer retirement when the last several decades Medicare and what's your\nYou need to have more money to fund that longer retirement when the last several decades\nMedicare and what's your sense of how well people are prepared for that possibility because it seems like for a lot of people the longevity risk is not going to be at the top of their concerns about retirement\nYou know you're absolutely right longevity risk out living your money basically is always top of mind for me I saw a study recently where only ten percent of the pre retirees age fifty plus who were surveyed said they are financially prepared for retirement last Thirty years\nMichael today it's to help change that in the minds of our listeners\nBut among the pre retirees that I talk\nTo you every day I sensed they do think about their longevity and what it means for them financially if they live a really long time and if they're not there yet I Try to just get those wheels spinning get them to think about it a little bit because I Believe that longevity is one of the most significant risks\nNot anymore in fact that figure to be much higher for some people may be close to two million or even beyond that depending on your lifestyle\nWould think knowing that number the size of the assets\nOr for some people may be close to two million or even beyond that depending on your lifestyle\nI Would think knowing that number the size of the asset base that you need to carry your retirement it would mean projecting retirement access right\nAbsolutely you definitely need a realistic list of retirement expenses many of your day to day expenses could decline could even disappear\nOnce you retire so for example if you're no longer commuting to work every day your auto expenses may go down depending on where you live maybe you don't even need a car so those are things to think about if your house is paid off by the time you retire maybe\nYou don't have a monthly mortgage payment to worry about\nBut if we look at the other side\nOf that ledger and we calculate what you have what'd you now worth ... that means adding up all the stuff\nA retirement account and I are a four one K. your Ross and investment portfolio your stocks bonds if you have any of those that are individually held\nYour home or their real estate holdings argue a surge donor and a vacation home you and your siblings went in on those kinds of things do you own a business do you have insurance contracts and any other assets\nThat you may own some people we see may have specialized collections maybe guns or cars or Navajos blankets or something those all fall into the asset category\nAnd then we want to compare one side of the ladder\nTo the other the assets you have where you project to have a retirement versus the expenses you expect to have to go from there you can really figure out a strategy for continuing to build that asset pace and for how to ... spend down those assets sustainably overtime\nSo no doubt given all the factors that come into play in these calculations from inflation to the assumption is you have to make about investment growth rates were really makes sense to work with somebody who can coaches for somebody who can be your quarterback somebody who is a financial professional\nSo of course in our office we really believe that creating and then and the many and regularly revisiting a strategy for protecting your retirement nest egg presents a unique set of challenges and I think these are challenges that you don't necessarily want to put in the hands of just anyone\nAnd today Karen is offering you a chance to call in set up an appointment go in and visit with them at retirement evolution is this is a complementary customize map that you'll get for your retirement here's the number to call five to zero three nine nine\nSix three for one again there's no obligation and they're going to look at the big picture like we've been saying they'll talk to you about your needs and retirement your desires your dreams\nAnd based on that conversation they're going to provide you with a meaningful asset position as a map and if you want greater level of certainty about your income and your financial well being than don't pass this offer up have you've saved about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement that number to call is five to zero\nThree nine nine six three for one you call right now during our show five twenty three Ninety nine sixty three forty one\nI really am for I'm here with Karen ... you're listening to retirement evolved Karen is an advisor at retirement evolution and like I said she's trained to Medicare Social security\nHealth care insurance she focuses on women and families and their health their financial and retirement planning needs so check out one she'll be hosting another workshop for women only you guys have does all the time don't you care and\nWe do that will be starting back up again in January I Am on hold for Medicare seasoned\nI'm okay because you're very busy so let me just guide you to their website for everything red Evo dot com R. E. T. E.\nSam okay because you're very busy so let me just died due to their website for everything Rhett Evo dot com R. E. T. E. V. O. dot com\nToday we're talking about what if we live and tell where one hundred okay we're talking about financial considerations for those people living to be one hundred carrying if you have clients who do crunched the numbers and it appears that they're going to come up short on assets to last them through a long retirement what would be their options\nWell I think it's kind of funny man because you just invite our listeners to call in if they've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement uh-huh and some people may be thinking what are you crazy you just told me I Need a million plus ... right so again I Want to go through we talked about what\nAll of those assets may be so if it looks like you're going to come up short or if you're worried about coming up short there are some obvious chops you can take one of them is to start saving more right now so if you're not in retirement yet\nStart saving more contribute as much as you can afford and as much as the law allows to your retirement plan whether it's a four O. one K. or an IRA\nOr a ... or whatever that vehicle may be that you have the ability to contribute to and also take advantage of any matching retirement plan contributions for stock purchase programs from an employer folks that's free money take the free money right\nWhite and if you're over fifty also try to take advantage of these catchup provisions that the government has provided for us with your retirement accounts and the federal government allows people who are\nOver age fifty to make a larger tax deferred retirement plan contributions to kind of make up a little bit of that ground that maybe you didn't do when you were younger\nThat eventually once retirement hits I've learned from you that it becomes a matter of converting assets into income right\nIt does and you need to do this at a rate that really provide you with enough income to cover your expenses an fund the lifestyle you want to live but you have to be careful\nThat that really doesn't deplete your asset based so much that you run out of money prematurely you need to take stock of your retirement income sources establish how much money you'll have coming in from where\nWhen and second in command so that may be things like Social Security your retirement accounts maybe a pension\nYour investments median income from a job we have lots of retirees who go on to reinvent themselves and I'm retirement and go work in their passion versus they're kind of day to day drudgery they felt like they may have been doing maybe you've got rental properties maybe have annuities\nYou want to figure out the rate at which you can sustainably\nBend down your assets so that they last as long as you can eat\nAt the end of the day everybody needs a retirement income strategy a written planned right\nYou'd do it really is important and not only do you need a written plan done so that you have an idea of what's happening\nToday based on things but it needs to be revisited in the future because\nNo matter how long you expected to live you need some type of blueprint for how you're going to spend on those assets give you a game plan for having that monthly income that you need every month and given some of these complexities developing a retirement income strategy\nIsn't necessarily a do it yourself undertaking so even if you're pretty savvy about investing and finances\nDeveloping an overall strategy really understanding where that red lines falls and your retirement plan where you actually going to run out of money this is one of those things you may be better off developing in conjunction with a financial professional somebody who can be your coach through that process\nSo whether retirement is already a ...\nConjunction with a financial professional somebody who can be your coach through that process\nSo whether retirement is already upon you know whether it's just close at hand maybe even a distant reality my contemporaries are certainly starting to look at retirement now that the goal for everybody really is the same you want to keep as much money as you can in your own pocket so you have choices in control\nOf not only your financial present but also your future folks this he does not happen by accident which you really need is a well thought out strategy for your retirement and the best thing you can do is develop it with the help of somebody who understands the big picture and all the moving pieces\nSo today we're offering you a chance to give them a call at retirement evolution here's their number five to zero three nine nine six three for one\nYou can call and they put together a customize map a meaningful asset positioning about your own retirement is going to be just for you and

for us to get to know you to get to know what your goals are in retirement to understand\nMore about your specific financial picture\nAnd to make sure that you are able to pull that altogether even your own mind sometimes people commended up first appointment where\nThey thought they were wasn't quite where they are when they start digging through their documents and looking at him so that first

perfect time to get started five twenty three nine nine six three for\nOne again you're listening to retirement evolved with Kevin damn shit I'm ... and Karen is here to help you to coach you maybe you have questions about Medicare because enrollments now maybe you have questions just about retirement and general things we're talking about today are you going to have enough money to last\nYou too and through your entire retirement let me give you their website is wretch evoke dot com R. E. T. E. V. O. dot com also you can go to Brett evil map\nDot com that's another place you can log on and learn more about them and play around with some various tools with your retirement again Brett Evo dot com or read evil map dot com\nKaren I don't have a pension but I have an IRA or I have a four one K. what could I Do to stretch the assets in those accounts so that they will be capable of lasting until I'm a hundred years old or more\n... and I appreciate you giving that red ... map dot com website because those tools on there are fantastic and a great place for you to start doing some research on your own and I think it's really important because when we look at the four oh one K. the onus is really a\nIt is for you to start doing some research on your own and I think it's really important because when we look at the four oh one K. the onus is really on the employee not the employee earth to fund that plant so it's the individual not the employer who has\nTo figure out how they're going to stretch their assets so they're not exhausted prematurely that's because funds from a four O. one K.\nOr another type of qualified account are often required to come out each year beginning at the individuals they adjust Seventy and a half this is what we call required minimum distributions or are in ... for short and this time of year of course we're talking a lot to her clients who\nThey've got to be taking there are indeed so if they hit Seventy and a half this year they're coming back into our office we're making sure those are good and structured for them\nSo in most cases at least currently these types of plants don't have features that allow the account holders to convert their assets directly into an income stream\nIn my experience I'd say maybe ten or twenty percent of the defined contribution plans like a four O. one K. offered that option to a new a tie it into an income stream the numbers increasing about kind of where we are today you know it really is important though to build an income stream for yourself\nGiving yourself a form of that longevity insurance we kind of talked about at the beginning of the show but deciding whether you're a good candidate for an annuity and if so what kind that's a discussion you should absolutely have with someone who understands how I knew what he's work someone who is independent have\nAccess to lots and lots of options
