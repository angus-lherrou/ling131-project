why\nDo they it's grotesque I mean it it is just unbelievable and and you know my habits some I'm so impressed by the quality of the journalism and the care with which this has done\nBut there's really a larger political message here which is that if you get a W to like most people you get a salary you have basically no chance to try to cheat on your taxes I mean they they they withhold a certain amount every two weeks that's just sort of how taxes work in this country but if you're rich like the trumps you can set up a system like this\nThat's right but you set up a system like this

majority is already tweeted publicly about how many people were interviewed\nIn the cabinet as previous background investigations the majority will permit the public disclosure of the number of people interviewed by the FBI for the supplemental background and they say nine were interviewing I thought they were to send them ten yeah they said ten but now I think what they're looking for it seems is

let's look\nAt the last night I had not heard from Senator Durbin\nAnd now he's so now it's ... do you have that James he sounded really confused today let's listen\nAs of last night I had not heard from Senator Durbin and wasn't sure what he's referring to\nI just consult with him a few moments ago I Know what he's referring to and I agree with Senator Durbin and you agree that there were previous and there was a way ordered an FBI of sexual behavior inappropriate sexual behavior by on what I'm confirming that that's not let's be careful here for was the whole abuse and because it's one of two things\nI'm simply going to say I support Senator Durbin assertions\n[laughter] Mm I think they're just ... they don't know what to do at this point they thought one of these things is going to pan out I mean they say the stall ...\nI think it's good news for Republicans I really do I think now Republicans are more United than they've been since the day after the election maybe even more United and they'd been since nine eleven that's what I said last night and that's why I really believe or let's go to a JC Florida on line one Jaycee\n[noise] uh I just wanted to say like most on the right I'm really happy and grateful that Lindsey Graham said what he said and continues to call up a left but\nWe've grown so accustomed to our representatives not really doing our job is pushing back not fighting left on a consistent basis so when one of them simply does their job and says what needs to be said all of a sudden we're treating them like a hero you know this should be the norm and not the exception\nSo this is Lindsey and the others were sent to Washington to do and we're all wedding ourselves with excitement because someone did what they were hired to do and that's a shame\nThat sounds great we don't do that ... that's a great point you know I think you know when I when I think that when people tweet around things like work a man helps an old lady across the street\n[laughter] or look ... look a uh uh uh someone helps in autistic kid in the in the\nSeven eleven or the other video of helping him stock things which it's nice but that's what we should do right that's humanity that's humanity that's that that is what we all should be doing\nSo I guess it's better to celebrate that than just keep saying negative things around people so that it is nice but it's kind of an all I'm saying is it's kind of sad that we have to we have to note that when someone is doing the right thing instead of as our caller said that's just what you should be no trouble\nSadly like so many representatives and senators they don't reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your ... and Lindsey Graham the other day he walked through Fox out of the green room\nPeople who are applauding this he's walking down the halls and hands shaking him like he just came back from war but he made a speech and the committee defending the nominee that's what he did\nBy the way the Durban letter just quickly it says no where there's a Dick Durban to ... a Senator Grassley\nNowhere in any of the six Kevin ... FBI reports\nWhich the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way ... inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse he wants some of that released he thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out miss characterize what's in these\nFBI findings\nSo it's it's casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in this FBI report\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut on line three ...\nUh the I think a lot of people I've lost an appreciation for actually how profound you're through all the political saturation of ... you know the back and forth are profoundly positive your exposure of the left or they're they're I mean they're rabid\nSaturation of you know the back and forth all profoundly positive the exposure of the left or they're they're I mean they're rabid aggressive approach to the need for power um it's\nIt's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so they'll do literally anything to get there and what's happened in this capital earring is literally\nFrom what I you know for I'm Seventy three years old and from what I can see this is literally one of the most important periods of time to witness you know that that they it's their own destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I mean I've got plenty a Democrat from that or\nIt's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything are loving it this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very odd\nYeah that was the uh that was the open to the show last night now if there's any doubt anyone's mind just how out of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos\nWhere we should have calm where they want to rebel routes and intimidate instead of show results intimidation over ideas\nThat's where it is I think about it it's intimidation tactics you saw in the elevator and the restaurants in airports intimidation over information\nAnd insights they intimidate this is all ... they're the biggest bullies in town they're intolerant other of other people's views while they claimed to be the most tolerant they call you haters while they're the most hateful\nThey say that you're anti immigrant when all they do is talk about white privilege racist and you're they're obsessed with race we went all people to be treated the same\nThe rule of law should treat all people to St doesn't matter what color your skin is when you cross the border illegally that's the that's why the law so important doesn't give preference over one group or another shouldn't a five five forty Laura glass half full I Believe that are coming up next a former assistant FBI or\nA staffer from New York has interesting insights on what we're about to find out or not about these reports\n[noise]\n\n\nThe ... but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nWell first of all the the original background investigation was at a public document data so why should the follow up investigation be a public document what I'm going to be very interested in St Louis how long it takes\nA for that information to leak out of the skiff that's where they have to go to look at it and uh who's gonna who's gonna lab that it's going to be ridiculous but it will come out sooner or later during the\n... what a skiff is I Know what it is but my ...\nWell basically the skip is is a room that's a soundproof or you can't hear you can hear in as you walk in there you can't carry in the cell phone you or your wife I watch or anything like that you can sit there and read it it's like a lead enclosed room so nothing kind of traits that you can sit and read the recent report\nNot make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow him to make notes I don't know how they're going to stop that and\nUm and then they can leave that for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before something like that leaks out\nBottom line is how many and abused you have to do are as many it takes to delay this past the election watched\nIt outside their cards so the the current mayor coming down on this or not you don't you get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this weekend\nI think those should not be any more delays you do the best you can do\nAnd the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to ... is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative\nTo to allegedly offer ... and only to the way of looking at a a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nUm the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response\nIn college and law school or high school that that wasn't\nAdequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that they\nDo they know that if they haven't read it how do they know what's in the supplemental they they don't know what questions are asked who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the judge has some beers with\nOr who should yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surmise saying that they just want to keep the pot stir it up\nIn order to the you know continue that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it is but those that are opposed to the\n... we have an update here that Bill Bill or a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that ah the FBI prove ignored testimonies from former classmates of cabin all these are people that went to Yale with him and are they the the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is as you read and to the store you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim\nSomebody told them that somebody told them that this happened so it would the FBI pro those people are they just seen as not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and bottom line first of all it's coming from Ronan\nA secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses to that they not permitted on the stand and a quarter law never mind are doing this and if you have to make that cut off someplace into what is ... you know comment what does make sense to do\nAnd none of these people make sense and if anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody mhm\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just here say recollections of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense Laura and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here are the bureau is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out that the the the Democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all Trump Trump bands from the bureau\nIf it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know the beer is going to take a black guy from the other side of that was\nI just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have\nPeople have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nYou know broad ranging ... is this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what is what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media

[noise]\nYeah their their bottom dollars that's for sure\nThey don't care who get fly him they don't care who's reputation is forever marred uh as long as they can retain um power or get power it's by any means necessary and that is a sad sad lesson for our country\nAnd I hope we have parents who are educating their kids on what really happened during these last two and three weeks eight five five\nForty Laura I'm much time we have James\nEarl right when that thirty seconds are coming out Mark Penn uh he's going to give us a snapshot unaware the mid term election cycle is and I'm going to ask him whether the Democrats\nPlayed this game way too long of delay and whether you know they really they just overplay their hand is overplay their hand here and extreme do they look too extreme\nFor the American people now and how will that affect a midterm election a turnout if at all eight five five forty Laura\nOkay\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Jenny cell sunspot correct her she says she loves it it should go to product every day\n[noise] so I see that the American public is pretty sensible or as you suggest you do they say well look we saw this testimony\nWe believed Ford and we believed Kavanaugh also and\nSo what really makes the difference well does the FBI find cooperation are not well what we find in the polling is that sixty percent said well look there's no cooperation them in fact the nomination should be confirmed and that included eighty six percent of Republicans Democrats or Doug you\nLook Democrats even after there's no ... sixty percent of Democrats [noise] you know would oppose the nomination but you see that sort of the center\nOf the country says hey if I could see\nThat there's no crime operation I'm going to be fair here I'm not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there is no cooperation and that's certified by the FBI\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the G O P A new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree ah and they were made some joke about Tina Fey um who took\nWhite women to task after the Trump election who helping him get elected providing him with fifty two percent of their support\nSay stay focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent home of them voted for Trump saying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said\nWell now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support among Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points well that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people\nVoting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the ...\nI think that is the the biggest\nBut both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans on and victory points for the Democrats so far which is that the cost of what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women\n[noise] who voted twenty points for Romney who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for ah for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis cabinet nominations never hope that I always thought that a woman nominee who even a woman nominee what might have been more conservative would actually have been the right strategic choice here\nI I think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters\nTrump took but those are the voters are up for grabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWere credibly disorganized and I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately\nUh [noise] I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading and and now I think you're going to see it kind of a balance among turn out here because the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again ... you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who\nYou know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination or the party when it's United is pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white guy pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so you know it's so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nWell but see that's ironic thing\nThat I did you see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races tightened up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this is Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted forty courts for Trump you know there's no question that\nIt's gonna be a large percentage more way above a majority that would work she confirmed which are in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think for the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit\nHis job at the end didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message we're we're McConnell or as you say has stepped up ... maybe some people think we're leaving some people you know what I think too harshly but as you said he stepped up you've got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah houses that are less\nIt's rather lifts and it's a Paul Ryan should have left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing would be taken over by someone who wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now a Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us that's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break\nEight five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think it people said Trump was embodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have your vote are some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote or you got to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in his basic principle of fairness and would as mark said if you really shy away from my identity politics\nAnd political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to vote get a get out there and vote and vote Republican don't go away\nAnd a\nRepublican year will be a Democrat and Republican he's been able to do something my friends on the other side I could never do you not just party the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "04"}
