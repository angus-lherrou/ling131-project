J. R. H.\nA out of ah what does that tell a co-op I'm going to go with ...\nCherokee Nation issued a statement Monday on mass ... sets senator guys wouldn't take a listen both Warren's DNA test result Senator Warren released her DNA report to the news media with the phony help of some funny academic at a phony college\nOr in response to president Donald Trump's taunting her for her saying she was part Native American you know I Will I Will have it be known President Trump did not start this this was well underway I was calling her focus on us before\nPresident Trump even came down the escalator running for president so and and us up to like say I invented it because I just want to point out that the news media is saying that President Trump invented this this taunted those mockery of a\nOf a Senator Warren with her phony Indian thing and that's not true this has been going on for a long time this mockery of of her\nOf her ridiculous claim\nSenator weren't released her and says the report and it said that the great majority of Warren's identifiable ancestry as European\nHowever the report adds the analysis also identified five genetic segments as Native American in origin at high confidence and this is what Elizabeth Warren put out now this is a a joke of course\nHowever yesterday afternoon Cherokee Nation released a statement saying\nIn part that DNA tests are useless in determining tribal citizenship and people using DNA to connect themselves to Cherokee Nation is inappropriate\nAnd uh that was a a gentle right on what they said because they were a little more direct the statement itself says from the Cherokee Nation\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish\nListen to this whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and wild DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nI senator or you're going to you racists bigots or you're going to stop offending Native Americans now it makes a mockery out of DNA tests\nAnd it's legitimate uses well also this honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage that is ...\nSenator

of state of the Cherokee Nation they're independent nations was also on the television last night on Fox News channel he was on CNN surprise surprise where he didn't help or Elizabeth Warren's cause either\nThe problem with the DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation a member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best can give you some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're related to somebody live long ago that may have lived in North and South America may have been a native\nPeoples of those continents um it's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country\nIt is irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American so this whole thing was just won't want want it's Emily la tele it's

let's go to Elizabeth Warren she's out there saying that the president or a million dollars let's go to number four\nBecause this is what President Trump actually said when he made this ah the news media and and and Elizabeth Warren not smart people not the it really you can't take them seriously\n... saying no President Trump or a million dollars because she fulfilled all of the requirements that President Trump laid out if she gets a DNA test\nAnd it proves that she is in fact part Paul Paul then President Trump owes her a million dollars this is the phony arguing that they just lie about everything they live ... about Brett Kavanaugh there are a lot about Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton lives about everybody they live about everything\nAnd a President Trump actually said these words in July about the DNA tests\nYou know those little kids they saw on television for two dollars\nAnd first of all the little kids and in\n[noise] which he claims that she's of Indian\nBecause her

your hand\n\n[noise]\nNow the test does not show she's an Indian be a debate has not happened she is not the Democrat nominee for the presidency of the United states has not given her the uh the uh

President Trump keeps going my mother a liar that he didn't call a Elizabeth Warren's mother mall pall a liar didn't call anybody a liar\nHe didn't want to call my mom a liar\nHe didn't do that and he's so she just lied there in calling a saying\nI think I'd like to call my mom a liar\nYeah he didn't do that he'd so she just lied there in calling a\nSaying that President Trump was lying about her mother being a liar there's a lot of lying going on here it's a circle festive lives a tangled train wreck of laws stupidity\nBut there it is um he didn't say that your mother's alarm or he did

Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial and a state protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nStock market the sock continues as one day we're up and then the next day it back down [noise] so what exactly is going on in the financial\nWorld and on Wall street and what's driving markets today now that the stock market has officially experience it confirmed stock market corrections were values dropped by ten percent or more for many peak volatility is back in a big way\nOne of the major factors that has led to this correction besides the ... market melt up we saw in January where we saw stock markets up over seven percent Justin one month alone\nIs now all the talk about the end of free money\nWell you may want to know what is exactly free money and why didn't you get any of it well you did actually in a way but maybe not how you exactly wanted to get it the end of free money is referring to the massive quantitative easing stimulus programs at the Federal Reserve\nEstablished shortly after the big financial meltdown in two thousand eight and two thousand nine\nThis economic stimulus was designed to boost the economy by injecting low cost or even no cost capital or money into the banking system and on Wall street\nThis is called in was called quantitative easing also known as Q. E. and we had to eat one you eat two and three and then she we infinity\nNow here we are and the feds have officially ended quantitative easing back in two thousand Seventeen during this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation was still very\nBeing back in two thousand Seventeen\nDuring this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation was still very low and yes did it work maybe but what did this quantitative easing or this free money really give us well it gave us low interest rates and most of us have benefited from that in some sort of way\nPerhaps a low rate on a house or a car or a business loan we become addicted to these low interest rates\nSo has Wall Street low rates also means low saving rates on bank money which causes us to seek higher returns elsewhere like in the stock market\nAnd well that has worked wonderfully over almost eight fold nine years now so here we are at a critical point in our history and our economy with inflation fears now at the forefront of discussion we've already seen interest rates now taking a little higher\nWe're now seeing spikes in the yields on what most consider a risk free investment and that is the ten year treasury note\nWhen inflation starts to become a problem well the Federal Reserve will respond and the only way they know how\nAnd that is by raising interest rates and when that happens when interest rates rise that can start to put the brakes on the economy and then our whole economic cycle starts to change and our time of grow turns into a time of contraction\nNot that that's the idea of the Federal Reserve to cause a recession but it's just the nature of the beast it's economics\nAnd when that happens or there is even the slightest indication of something like that happening Wall Street is way ahead of the game on this and we'll start to see yet another bear market and perhaps one like we've never seen before where we can see drops of at least fifty percent or more\nIn the depths of the stock market bloodbath after the crash in two thousand eight early two thousand nine the Dow Jones was trading adjust sixty five hundred that was the index level\nIf we returned to those levels again\nThat's a Seventy five percent drop from where we are today so again we're at a critical point one where the stock market still just hasn't made up its mind as to what it wants to do so why risk all your portfolio on something that seems to be just pure chance\nOur message here at Mayfield financial is different at our core is the principle of financial safety\nNow do all investment advisors offered this unfortunately no this type of planning or the planning that looks to take care of your essential needs first it's often not addressed\nIn this Wall Street dominated financial world that we're in too many investment advisers and individuals try to seek sky high returns and run the odds it's all probability based it's about calculating risk\nAnd hoping that a worst than worst case scenario won't ever happen during your retirement\nTo me and for all of us here at Mayfield financial that simply doesn't work\nI don't like running probabilities when it comes to retirement\nI Want certainties I Want guarantees I Want a retirement plan that puts safety first and where risk isn't measured by what stocks and bonds you have in your portfolio but as measured by their risk of losing your comfort\nYour house your income\nThese types of risks are there real risks we want to consider when planning for retirement\nSo there are many questions to answer when it comes to knowing what to do with your retirement money in your savings and how to best position yourself for the long term so what is the answer\nWell it depends it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met and want to continue the lifestyle that we're comfortable with throughout retirement\nSo here at Mayfield financial we are a safety first retirement planning from\nWe take a look at your retirement plan and identify how to secure your income needs we can help you identify your essential\nWe take a look at your retirement plan and identify how to secure your income

street and cross your fingers and close your eyes when you watch the evening news that's no way to handle your money\nInstead you want to have a plan that can provide you a solid foundation of income and when combined with your other income sources either pensions or Social Security or maybe a lemonade stand that you run on the weekends\nIt can provide you with the income that you are going to want to have and that you need throughout your retirement\nThe best example of this comes from what happened in two thousand eight and we are now coming up on the ten year anniversary of one of the worst financial crises this country has ever experienced Wall Street and our economy was brought to the absolute brink\nStocks were in the toilet and for those and kept their hard earned money in Wall Street were decimated\nFinancial retirement plan based on probability and based entirely on Wall street where ruined the so called probability models didn't account for this type of market drop\nAnd people who are retired suffered a loss of income some were forced to sell their homes or what was left of their home value or even return to the workforce\nNow a retirement plan that based on safety that built on guarantees what happened to those during two thousand eight nothing\nThose income levels remain the same for our clients and not a single penny was lost that's what a safe money plan is

Karan it's great to be here with you again oh my gosh what happened on Wall street last week\nWill naturally market volatility is on our mind obviously the markets moved around a little bit last week we could say and not in the direction that most of us like\nAnd so there's a lot of questions is what does it mean for our listeners what does it mean to your investments and and if your retirement and the near future\nWhat does that mean for you or not necessarily the drop was incredibly dramatic but it was certainly there but what if we had a drop that was big or what do we need to look at her what our listeners need to pay attention to and I guess one of the things that we look at whenever we see markets like that and if\nThat was big or what do we need to look at it or whatever I listen to me to pay attention to and I guess one of the things that we look at whenever we see markets like that and if people are getting very nervous are concerned about that than they probably need to take a closer look at their portfolios and do an evaluation\nOf really how much risk they're taking inside their portfolios and I think that's a lot of things that sometimes is looked at when people look at their portfolios are not looked at as closely let's not say that it's not looked at but to have a true understanding of what ones risks are in their portfolio\nI think is critical in a lot of people tend to see a larger drops when they don't realize the actual\nAmount of risk that they're taking inside their portfolio I Would sure but a lot of the folks that we work with a particular our phone to ring off the hook as the markets we're going down because we've structured their assets in such a way their investments in their entire retirement picture if such a way that we're able to kind of glide through these areas down terms\nBut if you're having that worry if you're having that concern you know as our listeners you should sit down with someone if it's not a sit down with somebody else\nAnd really get a good picture of what your risk\nIs what you're willing to risk and also get an understanding of how much risk truly is in your portfolio not just the naming conventions of your portfolio which means you know my advisor says I've been a moderate portfolio or conservative\nWhat does that really mean by the numbers and if you're advisor or if you can't do it on your own find somebody who can who can truly show you what kind of risks there are\nBut we all have to understand that the markets are going to make some changes there's going to be some ups and downs and we need to pay attention that and I don't care and has something she might want to end as well\nWell I Do I I think the other big question this week has been that fabulous\nAnnouncement for Social Security about the two point\nEight percent cost of living adjustment that our Social Security beneficiaries are going to be receiving in two thousand Nineteen but then of course also just announced is that the Medicare part B premium will be increasing from a hundred and thirty four dollars worth of an anti thousand Eighteen\nUp to one thirty five fifty for two thousand Nineteen and the part B deductible is increasing\nFrom a hundred and eighty three dollars in two thousand Eighteen to a hundred and eighty five dollars in two thousand Nineteen so I think those are some important numbers I certainly gotten much questions I mean the last month or so about when those numbers would be coming out\nYeah I was there was a quick math in my head and actually the Social Security increase is higher than those costs of Medicare so we got a a maybe a little percentage or percentage and a half\nActual increase or Social Security increases\nLater on in the show what we are going to hear something you don't want to miss out on his one of my colleagues sat down with financial educator in New York Times best selling author David Bach and to also talk about the markets and how it impacts you\nWere actually going to squeeze that interview in on the show today it's something you're not going to want to miss out on and it's coming up a little bit later in our program yeah so the way and why don't you take this away for\nAh right I Will take it away I Am excited about that at every because I Want to hear what he has to say about this recent volatility in the market but I I Want to take you back to the Nineteen eighties you all remember that three D puzzle the ruby life totally\nYeah I mean you can\nLiterally man [laughter]\nYou good at it\nOh no no it wasn't a great up to ... keep John however was a phenomenal rebut chief solve our kids and I like\nPuzzles some thing that I had to solve it yes I worked at that you've\nA dad okay well we all know that you know just as soon as you are about ready to one side one moving you messed up the whole thing and it honestly is kind of like plenty out of retirement strategy an income strategy you've got to align the various pieces of your retirement perks\nThis kind of like plenty out of retirement strategy an income strategy you've got to align the various pieces of your retirement portfolio puzzle for maximum income and it can seem a bit daunting so today\nWe're going to focus on along with market volatility or going to focus on solving a couple of size of your retirement puzzle John and care and I know you spend a lotta time every single day helping others solve this retirement puzzle so I\nKnow you help them with their withdraws from their pensions and therefore one case and the IRA all to their best advantage come retirement right\nWhat you are right they're making all the pieces of the retirement income puzzle fit together can be tricky\nGiven factors like taxes and the fact that so few people nowadays actually have a punch in the fall back on when retirement arrives\nInflation is low currently in health costs are increasing there are a lot of pieces to consider and just like a jigsaw puzzle or the Rubik's Cube that we were just talking about it can feel overwhelming when you begin but today I Want to relieve some of the confusion frustration and of course combination of beginning to solve this puzzle\nMy colleague Megan ... had a chance to sit down with financial educator in New York Times best selling author David Baake for an insightful conversation\nAbout what this volatility means for you in retirement and we have a opportunity to listen in on this what we're going to do was over the next ten to twelve minutes we're going to listen to that interview with David ...\nIf you have any questions about what you hear that you can call John and Karen right now during our show that number to call his five to zero three nine nine six three for one five twenty three Ninety nine sixty three forty one\nOctober tenth saw the worst day for the down since February a big drop in popular tech stocks put an impact\nWill sell off in motion so what does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street and David been featured on Fox CBS\nCNBC the today show and\nOprah David been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades\nHe's nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finish rich and smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of Eighteen wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze David wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nThanks for having me on the show let's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and so the question becomes all is there anything specific that's going on and I'll give you a sample the first thing is that rates are going and you even heard the president talked about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates\nThe fed the actually been raising rates really two thousand\nMost recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can lend it called the Federal Reserve fund ... record happens temper\nAnd when those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes right so you're going to borrow money for a whole if you're going to refinance or if you're going to buy a car and you're going to finance a car\nOr you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where's your borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up and that's from the market right because if you're well maybe people will buy less home they'll refinance so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop is what it costs more to borrow money\nThe markets can spoof that consumers will slow down on there's been so that's the first thing it's really been a story about the fed and rates\nGoing up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years\nAnd those historically the rates the fed put in place after our great recession we're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective\nDavid I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can spell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way we'll pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to reach retirement earlier\nThey are good for retirees especially retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to reach retirement\nEarly is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan and you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if you're doing one retirement than the good news about race going higher is that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries\nAre going to hire the most retirees live off of the\nIncome that their retirement money produces so the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe ten year treasuries could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know what that's pretty good I can live off of the income checks and so I think it is for retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David not well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of the market correction\nSo I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] yeah\nYou're right it's funny because here's nobody knows right what I Know and and we've been talking about this and maybe you know I've done other interviews on I Know we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had and\nAt the same standpoint the last day two months I've been telling people don't get reading right like\nDon't now is not the time to get greedy now's not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties in the markets pullback you can't afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you're retired or your comfort level with seeing your money drop significantly is going to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you're approaching retirement or you're already retired that you talked with a financial adviser that you work with a financial adviser that if you have a financial wise right now that you pick up the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do call your financial advisor go back into their office\nSit down with them have them walk you through what you're invested in a lot of people who are retired that might be fearful of the stock market today\nActually have a very what we call very low exposure to the stock market like all meet people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and half of their money isn't an annuity payment a guaranteed rate and half of their money is in bonds and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so uh but they read the news and they're very fearful so don't be fearful find\nOut find out how much money do you actually have in the market\nHow much risk are you taking and again work with your financial advisor I just a big believer that\nA working with a professional for Jewish area which is what we recommend people work with a register investment advisor when you work for the financial wise or the the most important part is that they do a financial plans for you\nThat they get to understand what your comfort level with risk is\nAnd then they help you build an investment portfolio based on your goals and your comfort level with risk if you have a very low comfort level with it take any risk well then you should have less money in the market but the key right now to notice when markets are pulling back the most important you can do ... is just call your advisor don't panic\nSits still don't do anything every market pullback ultimately has had I Can't promise it will always\nIt's just call your visor don't panic [laughter] still don't do anything every market all that ultimately has had I Can't promise it will always out but I can tell you it's always had a recovery right every single major market pull back\n... is that a recovery so I'm just a big long term believer that you wanted diversified portfolio high quality investment built off of financial plan working with a financial wise you can trust that they're old your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky part\nDavid fantastic insights on this market drop what the silver lining here and all of this\nWell I think the silver lining is how incredible and economy we have right now like let's not leave side of that look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment in America in forty nine years\nUnemployment's three point seven percent right now why is that because we have an incredibly strong economy right now so GDP which two years ago no what do you believe that you could get three well most people certainly GDP right now\nOh first half of the year ... points you said there are projects shows the third quarter\nCould be as high as four percent so the economy in the U.S super strong and things really are very very positive which is why by the way also we'd had stock markets hitting\nAll time not so just notice\nThings Connie are strong this was a very normal time to see a pull back in the market if anything it's probably very healthy that we're seeing a pull back in the market right now and just notice the economy's doing really well the tax cut that that is a huge impact and for the foreseeable future we see an economy that's continuing to grow\nDavid Baake always a pleasure thank you for your insights today begging my pleasure thank you\nWhat we think all of our listeners to listening to what they would buck had to say he certainly had some compelling things to look at\nAnd these are concerned that a lot of us are facing we're ... we're getting close to her in retirement or really are investments as a whole he talked about a lot of different things that are in the interview you know one of the things is is is getting your affairs in order it's nice to listen to the professionals and we're glad to have David Box piece on our show but\nWhat you really got to do is be able to sit down and get a plan put together for yourself\nAnd as we've talked about throughout our show and ... times throws shows is that we're always offered twelve or listeners an opportunity to come in and get your map which is a process we have a name here\nWhich means meaningful last a position\nWhich is a way for you to really get a clear picture and find a partner to help you through the retirement process and making sure that you have the income that you need in retirement to make sure that your state planning to put together to make sure that you have tax clarity in retirement\nOut your retirement are there any gaps that need to be felt\nThey're going to help you along the way like I mentioned they help people retire every single day you and I are going to retire one time so they know all the ins and outs that you need to know\nSo tap into their resources are right there here for you five to zero three nine nine six three for one that's the number to call and also here's their Web site at retirement evolution\nIs Rhett Evo dot com R. E. T. E. V. O. L. dot com so it's just short for their business and then if you want to add\nThe word map to it rats evil map dot com then you can play around with some tools and get started on your retirement journey so red Evo dot com or rat evil map dot com\nToday we're talking about making the right decisions at the right time of course we're talking about your four one K. is your IRAs everything has to do with retirement how can proper asset diversification helps sustain a portfolio for the long run\nThis was certainly where you ballots risk and reward by giving up your assets in different investment products and solutions stocks bonds cash which typically move in different directions depending on the environment based of course on your goals risks tolerance and timeline\nWell they certainly don't guarantee returns stocks can provide solid growth opportunities growth could help you address inflation over time and that can be quite beneficial as inflation can certainly be up in over your retirement your purchasing power\nFor example financial services for fidelity found that something with a price tag of fifty thousand dollars today like a car in twenty five years from now will cost as much as eighty two thousand adjust to\nFifty thousand dollars today like a car in twenty five years from now will cost as much as eighty two thousand adjust eight to ... percent inflation rate which is very low and a four percent inflation rate the price tag would be just over a hundred and thirty three thousand\nAnd for our listeners today you need to understand that how tough your medical costs throughout retirement are increasing at a rate right now over four percent so I think that's a good number to pay attention to\nRight and what's more stocks that may be considered less risky\nThose that are retiree may gravitate toward in retirement depending on their risk and reward and comfort levels often payout admitted so they provide the potential for long term growth with a potential for a bit of income\nIn fact the S P five hundred index dividend yield was about to point two percent towards the end of two thousand sixteen which was not too bad given the low interest rate environment\nNow obviously no investment strategy in the market guarantees a profit or that you will lose money but I weld diversified portfolio can help you move out the volatility of the market and offer you the opportunity for the opportunity for growth but a diverse asset mix is key\nTo help address off the risk of inflation longevity and market ups and downs\nSo portfolio construction is important but the other thing is is that you want to balance growth expectations with loss expectations\nWhen you're working I think a lot of our listeners don't pay too much attention to that because you're putting in money each month on your four one K. C. don't necessarily see the account go down as much because you continue to keep putting money in but in retirement you're no longer putting money in\nSo we're not saying not go for growth but temper your growth expectations and understand that slow and steady wins the race and retirement at least that's the belief that we have we're not saying eliminate growth but slow and steady wins the race\nAnd I think creating and then of course in so many and definitely periodically revisiting whatever the strategy is that you put in place for protecting your retirement nest egg that really presents a unique set of challenges and you were challenges are going to be different than your neighbors\nAnd your neighbors are going to be different than their brother in laws and everybody's retirement is very unique\nSo really understanding exactly how to put that plan together\nHow to insulin in it and then how to make changes how to do those course corrections when you need to they are really important\nAnd you probably don't want to put those challenges in the hands of just anyone you want to work with people that are familiar with is that they're familiar with this process\nSo when you're among the first six callers who called five to zero three nine nine six three for one right now you'll get the customize complimentary map the meaningful asset position and again there is

your family is to plan\nYour retirement which is why they did the show every week and we're not talking about just a little plan in your head but it needs to be written out so they are here to help you see with clarity where you're headed on your pathway to retirement\nToday John and carrying a been giving us great insights on the timing of our MDs and qualify distributions for for one case and IRAs healthcare costs definitely need to be addressed in retirement how do you do that so that the assets in your retirement accounts don't quickly evaporate if a health issue comes up\nWell I think for folks to address their health care costs it kinda depends on where they are in their retirement planning process so if you're going to retire at fifty five you're fortunate you've done a great job you've built your nest egg\nYou've got your investment accounts that if you're retiring early you've got ten years before you become eligible for Medicare\nSo really making sure that you take a clear\nFocus to look on what you have access to as far as health insurance for that ten year period of time it's very important\nNow here in Tucson we had very limited individual plans available the last\nFew years I have a lot of challenging conversations with folks who are saying but I Want to retire and I'm saying well you can but here's what you're looking out for your health insurance costs so if you're an individual retiring at age fifty five and you know that your health insurance is going to run you seven eight nine hundred dollars a month as soon as she retired you've got a factor\nThat into your expenses until you become eligible for Medicare and now of course there's still costs associated with Medicare and once you turn sixty five we want to take a a careful look at how's your health how do you use your health insurance lots of\nFolks may choose to seek alternative health insurance so they may not want to pay a lot for health insurance plan doesn't cover alternative\nMethods that they're using any way so just a lot of pieces that go into what do we do about health insurance and retirement again really depends on when you're retiring\nAnd which are options are at that time now the individual health insurance of course changes yearly Medicare plans changed nearly so these are things you want to make sure that you evaluate but I just spoke with a couple last week who said well we had budgeted\nTheir in their early sixties sixty sixty one and they said well we budget a twelve hundred dollars a month\nFor our health costs over the next five years about twelve hundred dollars a month of going to do it you won't be able to get your house\nA hundred dollars a month for our health costs over the next five years about twelve hundred dollars a month of going to do it you won't be able to get your health insurance paid for it at twelve hundred dollars a month at that age much less\nBe able to factor in your additional health costs your co pay your co insurance you're deductibles all those out of pocket costs that come with health care as well so it really becomes a very important decision in your retirement planning and of course can have a huge impact\nOn you being able to live that life that you've dreamed about all the planning you've done up to retirement can be for not if a catastrophic health event is going to wipe out half of your retirement savings and a single year and then you get to go back to work and try and rebuild it again\nSo I think there's some other things to care for people that fifty five sixty five years of age age who say health savings account or something that maybe they should look into\nThe other thing that people could look into from health care standpoint as far as how we counseling work with people as as long term care coverage no long term care coverage can be done", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "21"}
