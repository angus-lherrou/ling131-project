eight hundred flowers is giving my listeners and exclusive thirty six for thirty six off thirty six autumn roses for thirty six dollars\nDozens and what's really interesting to me is that you're going to a lot of people who are saying yes we need to change things we can't keep\nWell it doesn't and what's really interesting to me is that you're going to a lot of people who are saying yes we need to change things we can't keep teaching for you know the jobs yesterday you know the the the tropes that's thrown out a lot of hype the other end of the hardest jobs of today and exist ten years ago\nAnd that's true but then they go say so we really need to train people for the hardest jobs today that are kinda misses the point for two reasons first of all you know say everyone should be trained to be a data scientist yes there are a lot of data scientist that we need right now but you know the whole economy is not a scientist\nThere's you know a lot more to the world than that but also if things are changing as quickly as they are then say well we're going to build an education course building anything takes time we're going to build an education on the needs of the day that still skating to where the puck is rather than where the puck is going\nAnd the only way we can skate to where the puck is going\nIs recognized that we are not going to know so we can say All right this is the destination instead we have to train people to be\nResourceful and creative adaptable on their own we can say this is the job of the future and teach kids how to do that job we have to say we don't know what the job at the future is going to be we have to train them to be resourceful and adaptable and creative and insightful\nOn their own so they can figure it out\nTalking to Danny any his new book is leverage learning how the disruption of education helps lifelong learners an expert with something to teach\nAnd I like what you you know you say there he is we need to go to where the puck is going to be not where the puck is and I think they're therein lies the the issue because we're we're teaching kids right now to just kinda go where where things are and we're telling\nMy son's eight I Want him to get a ... have an understanding that the world that he's living in today is going to be totally different in ten years as fast as technology goes\nWhen you look at education across the board not just higher education they if you could change one thing if I Can't use it then you look to let you change one thing what's the one thing from top to bottom that you would like to see done do you think would make a huge impact on the future of education\nAre the ones that so I have small children my my daughter's three and a half my son is two and this is very top of mind for me when I think of um elementary and high school education especially but it applies\nThroughout a career I think there are a lot of things that education I was doing wrong today that the one that I think it's insurmountable is the trains people to look to someone else to set their priority\nBut if they're teaching the wrong things you know I can supplement that at home if they are not in hiring people with the right skills you know you can you can get that in other places the information's wrong I find it somewhere else but this idea that you know you're going to go to whatever the educational context is all mentor school high school college whatever\nRight you're going to sit in a class do what you're told and and suddenly someone else is going to tell you how things are going to work someone else is going to tell you what is important someone else is going to tell you what is and isn't worth paying attention to that\nCauses all the most important parts of our of our brain of our faculties that we need to thrive in the modern world it atrophy right 'cause you need to pay the people in the driver's seat if we want to be able to figure things out in the future\nOh absolutely and I don't think that you know again it's it's very frustrating because we had this one size fits all education system but I don't think really works\nAnd I just it it's it's a very tough thing I look at this I have an eight year old\nAnd I see the world he's living in he's in the stem school does all these kinds of things that you know that that that is that it looks great it sounds great but I often wonder one of the things you're talking about in here and you just talked about a bit of that but like the fortitude you know how tough keep going when the going gets tough because I think that's one of the thing\nAnd I often wonder one of the things you're talking about it here and you just talked about a bit of that but like the fortitude you notice how tough keep going when the going gets tough because I think that's one of the things that that is missing\nIn this day and age especially with the younger generation is you put stuff in front of them and it doesn't work it seems like they just collapse under it and that is everything from sports to friendships to even education\nIt's a big challenge every now and it's it's a challenge boring of the very best intentions you notes but the road to help pay with good intentions\nBut in an effort to protect our kids from everything we've taken away their ability to deal with things that are difficult to make hard decisions break the key to Fort Hood shooting a lot of ways it's not about not going through\nAt the first experience of there's always fascinating research ACTs averse childhood experiences like traumatic really horrible things that we don't want to happen to anybody child or adult and there is a huge correlation between the more of these adverse childhood experiences you have the\nLess likely you are to be successful the more likely you are to be incarcerated lifetime earnings are lower all that kind of stuff but it doesn't always play out that and it's not about the experience it's about the lack of support and reinforcement after him through that experience where I had thought about\nYou know this thing that I wanted to happen I certainly didn't and the Sox it's about this thing doesn't happen the way I wanted and the socks and nobody told me that I'm Still going to be okay\nRight so it it's not about shielding people from those challenging experience it's about putting them in ... I'm not putting them in in situations the enabling them to have those experiences and learn from them there's something fascinating research I was looking at the other day about risky clay\nFighting about when you you look at children today um it it's like their whole environment is basically bubble raft you look at as a child playground today and like everything on the ground is like super soft and there's nothing they can call off of work bump into that so it's like the extreme of essentially having your kids\nThe bubble route but the opposite of that is risky play well we used to do and we were kids right you know jumping on rocks and climbing trees and you do those things and occasionally as in the fall down and scrape urine whatever [noise] and the the research shows is fascinating correlation between risky played as a child\nAnd produced a drug consumption of human nature I'm teen pregnancy all kinds of things because when as a child were never given the opportunity to have to make decisions that are heart in the moment and ...\n... you don't have that muscle you're not able to make the important some difficult decisions so it's a combination of empowering\nKids to to be in situations where now they might screw up and the circumstances and outcomes may not be ideal\nYou know with guard rails to keep them safe or as much as possible but you know let them have the opportunity to screw up and be there to tell them not you know your perfect and everything's okay\nBut look you can get through this you have what it takes the lesson here is to try harder you need to do something differently the lesson is not to give up you can handle that and they're here we're here to support that stuff\nReally literally ... you know and and I love that you know to me uh it's funny my son's a and he always says you know mom always wants to bubble wrap me that's all she wants to ... save can she make me ... you're just\nAnd I'm I'm you know I'm a seventies raised did I'm like yeah you know what it's good to eat dirt because you know you won't get sick like that's how my mom or your kind of raises you're going to get hurt don't do that again and ... we've taken that away and I think we take away the ...\nWe'll get sick like that's what my mom you kind of raises you're going to get hurt don't do that again and we've taken that away and I think we take away those obstacles for kids\nIt really hurts them I said the other day any that I look out in in the world that we live in now and kids nowadays it's play dates everything is controlled but then when we look on YouTube and all these things they tried to do crazy stuff\nBecause I feel like they're so sheltered that they will try to drink you know eat a pound of cinnamon or whatever they possibly can cause I feel like that's the only freedom they are getting\n... ... and they're going into those like really crazy extreme challenges without any\nYou know how you know we all we went to college we have time to to you know go out and started drinking does things for the first time and it doesn't take very long can you give us a live right you know I'm OK with one or two beers you know three or four or five is that\nRight we all learn what those limits are for ourselves but we're we're looking at a generation of kids have never had the opportunity to get a feel of what their limits are that's the way are suddenly in a position which essentially everyone gets to a position of freedom\nThey are not equipped to make good decisions\nNo no no it is crazy the books called leverage learning how the disruption of education of lifelong motors an expert was something to teach Danny anti appreciate your coming on today very interesting book and I think something that the uh ... academia and and the average if you're if you're a parent everybody should grab this and take a look at this thanks so much for coming on ...\nThank you for having Elisha\nAppreciate that that you had mentioned shows your Twitter ca J.

while conservatives may not like his personality they look at the box as you checked off and\nThey're like yeah I like that those things are good I like those things I Will tell you that because I don't want you to think that I'm I'm a hate mongering anything else that you're gonna throw out there on Trump but I like the things that he said he was going to do and he's done them and the reality is\nIs she is really starting to press the issue she said about three four weeks ago she was not ruling out looking into it and now two thousand twenty and doing something like this shows me that she's more than just series she's ready to take that next step\nAnd bring her brand of politics to America\nI also that he is running I Do not think you'd be able to do that all he'll destroy the guys got into that as well as you\nKnow and there you go start to build up the your going to turn our country in the Venezuelan start to build that up that process if she's going to turn this into Venezuela here she goes she turning us into Venezuela it's comic she's turning us into Venezuela\nAnd as we all know Venezuela is not good when they talk about socialism and the funny thing when they talk about social is right when they talk about socialism and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders brand of politics they never want to bring up Venezuela that's the thing they never want to bring up they never they don't want to talk about that because it's not pretty it's not\nIt was brand of politics they never want to bring up Venezuela that's the thing they never want to bring up they never they don't want to talk about that because it's not pretty\nIt's pretty it all the exact opposite of pretty right it's the exact opposite of ready they can talk about all they want but the reality is socialism never worked\nIn Scandinavia is not socialist where socialist them ever work no matter what what do you say to the American that like the idea of socialism and support it here\nI Would say that they should wake up and you don't need the government to dictate how your how to live your life or how much money you should make how your family should be a treat it or how much you should pay\nAbout that next time you hear Michael Moore celebrities praising those other than socialism rex economy rex lives [noise]\nAnd this and it kills\nYes it does it's ugly and it's never work and they can talk about all they want and that's why Trump is laughing he wants to take her on he wants to take her on\nHe's begging for Bernie he's begging for her because those independents out there who sit around and said to themselves\nAnd not a huge fan of Trump but you know what I'm not a fan of that socialism\nAnd they're speaking that giving more power to government giving more things to government handing over more of our life the government that's not what I Want I may not like\nWho he is as a person but I can get over that what I don't want is I like you as a person I think you're an okay person but the reality is you're going to destroy my life so I'll step away from that three two three five three eight twenty four twenty three at you had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us\nFor all the talk of we're going to get into recession we're going to have these things this is going to happen I'm like you guys know that's how bad our recession will be I don't know but I Will tell you one thing\nWhat's coming in the future that isn't being talked about needs to be talked about you know twenty thirty forty years ago you come out of college you have very little if any debt whatsoever\nYou could start to get on with your life you could start making money and you could take that earnings that you had because of that college degree and you could put that back into the economy we live in a different world now kids are coming out with hundreds of thousands upon thousands of dollars\nOf massive debt that is turning into hundreds of thousands of potentially millions of dollars in debt over years and instead of putting that money back into the economy like buying homes and things that come with homes what they're going to be doing is essentially trying to survive and that\nIs going to put a huge dent in our future economy\nOn student loan debt I'm I think it's important that people will be able to borrow to make what maybe the most important investment of their lives which is in their education a so overall I think far we need to invest in yourself is this something we should we should foster some into a couple of important Coffey as first\nIt's very important that people understand the nature of the nature of the borrowing and the risk that they're taking him and the and the possible payoffs and that sort of thing so that they make informed decisions\nInformed decisions are huge and there's a reason that they need to make informed decisions because I've got friends who graduated college twenty plus years ago they're still paying off their debts and their debts are nothing compared to their kids debts and there soon to be\nKids get to I mean these debts are massive and when you have the government stepping in saying we're going to guarantee all these loans you can't get rid of these laws all of a sudden you are making a house payment\nRight for you\nThe guarantee all these loans you can't get rid of these loans all of a sudden you are making a house payment\nRight for your education\nWhich is going to strike it's going to put a huge dent in what we're doing as we try to grow our economy your kids coming out with three hundred thousand dollars in debt and they're looking around and they're getting a job and they're making a thousand\nDollar a month payment or eight hundred dollar a month payment on some of these things and they're gonna be paying these things off for years and years and years and money that should go into the economy because that they would become a a productive member of society\nIt's gonna be tough because that's going into education and when you get the government involved the way it is the kind of money that they're guaranteeing these kids they're taking it out willy nilly and on top of that they're taking out other debt to be able to live while they're trying to go through school and it is going to eventually explode\nThe second thing is um I think alone among all kinds of debt or we don't allow student loan debt to be discharged Yvette right I'd be at a loss to\nTo explain why that should be the case so it's something and it does its fiscal policy this is something for you and not something for the fed but we do see is in federal search shows and other research shows you do start to see\nLonger term negative effects on people who can't pay off their student loans that hurts their credit rating it impacts the entire half of their economic life\nAnd that's something to think of it we may have a lost generation or two\nOf people who aren't going to be able to afford to live the way that their parents lived at even a fraction of the way that their parents live until their parents eventually passed away and leave them stuff to get themselves out from underneath this giant enormous burden of debt now granted they took it on themselves\nBut do you think about it\nIf an Eighteen year old comes due today and says give me a hundred and fifty thousand dollar loan you're going to be like\nShut up never going to happen\nIf an Eighteen year old comes today and say I need a hundred fifty thousand alone because I Want to go to school in a basket\nWeaving liberal arts degree from some college that's going to I'm going to come out with a degree after four or five years on top of that extra debt that I was you know taking credit cards to pay for these kinds of things of life that I wanted to lead just to survive\nYou're going to be like oh that's fine but what it does long term and when you think micro right now it doesn't affect him at think macro\nSo that's the that's the public policy argument for us to do something about student loan debt and the and the way we structure a higher education financing my question for you is do you see this as a macroeconomic risk\nIt will over time it's not something you can pick up in the day that right now but as this goes on and a student loan continues to grow and becomes larger and larger than it absolutely could hold back roads\nYeah and I think it's going to and I think for all of the talk of the new housing bubble that's coming in a lot of these other things over a trillion dollars in debt the kids and and young adults and even older adults boomers have a ton of it\nThat it's still sitting out there that is not going to be able to be discharged no should it be because why would you let somebody do that but the fact that you're willing to go out and say you know what I\nNeed this degree so bad\nThat I'm willing to spend three hundred thousand dollars and even if it's a hundred thousand dollar loan think about how long it's going to take you to pay that off heat is massive\nAnd what it's going to do for us in the future I don't think we're talking enough about it but it's coming it is three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had mentioned shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you a Mac\nHey let me tell you that you work hard for

outside support ah which you can't blame her she didn't take anything she gets to try to make a difference in her campaign\nUh but the Democrats feel like is it if they can turn Georgia to fully a\nYou know Philly blue then that will be a wall against Trump in twenty twenty what's the key to turning out voters and getting them to see\nThe great a danger of a Democrat takeover of Georgia\nI think they're waking up now is one of the things is concerned about is our base wasn't as motivated Democrats or but with the cabin on the confirmation with states ... statements like these people are finally realizing the real Stacey Abrams you know when somebody is going to having fundraisers in San Francisco\nThirty days out from election you know doing fundraisers with Cory Booker made she said this crazy statement about the undocumented folks being part of the blue way if she was with Elizabeth Warren of all the all bugs in the state of Georgia campaign for governor and\nPeople are realizing that that is not our values that is you know we're we're literally in a battle for the soul of our state and apply for our future and\nNot only about me and twenty a pain it's about our state it's about our country and we're going to die hard or I Will say that we saw a great turnout on our from our base yesterday in the first uh\nThe first uh ballots that were cast in early voting so I'm encouraging all conservatives you know and they even middle of the road Georgia's don't agree with on citizens voting in our elections they don't agree with given free college tuition and us citizens I don't agree with given\nHope scholarships which is our educational scholarship to those that are here illegally and folks to stand up or it's that bad I mean we're literally as you said biting the rest of the country sixty five percent of her money has come from out of state in this election\nI have to ask you about this caravan situation a because once again the Democrats are trying to play the\nEmotional manipulation game on this issue where the victims of illegal immigrant crime in the United states get almost no coverage in the mainstream media but the you know the tails and the lows of individuals who are making a long and dangerous track from Central America to our southern border\nAre you know their catalog and their chronicled like you know something out of a Charles corral a Sunday CBS Sunday Morning you know special\n[laughter] well and and that's what that's what people are so frustrated not only in our state but on our country they're ready for governor is going to put them first head of the special interests them in a former\nDirector for ice in force went under the Obama administration called on Stacey Abrams to get out of the race after this outlandish comment that she made and you know over the weekend she was doing the Sunday talk shows up in DC or New York or wherever she was\nYou know I was down in southwest Georgia on Saturday back again this morning where we literally have are farmers that are family suffering from hurricane and [noise] you know that's what this race is about the money it's about ... Jordan's versus about that in our country first a head of those that are here illegally\nAnd no no no one has or sympathy for people and their their\nFlights in their countries but you know we have to protect our own we have to have secure borders we cannot go to other countries and get free government healthcare we cannot go to other countries and get you know free education I got three teenage daughter so you know it it's going to cost billions to do all these\nRadical things that Stacey Abrams wants to do and she's going to raise taxes on artwork Georgians to pay for it and people are tired of that and they're waking up and they're turning out and we're going to put that red wall\nBut we need conservatives across the country to join the fight like others are doing to help or you know drive the socialist radical liberal agenda go to jail for governor dot com and helpless if they can't or with their prayers and also their pocket books were in the fight of our life and it's not only about\nTwenty Eighteen is about twenty twenty as oil\nCamp for governor dot com camp for governor dot com go to that website help out\nIn first on the brain which is where what we need it to be we need the situation handled in a humane and smart way but your your focus is to care for the people of Georgia people of of this country and we cannot be good to anyone\nIf we'd dilute what we have with a porous border and absurd immigration loopholes that essentially result in catch and release which is what the president is so frustrated about uh Brian I have to play for you something that Stacey Abrams\nIs a bidding on pretty hard which is the claim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration in the state uh which of course can play both ways but ah we're going to a place and get your reaction much less than\nFifty three thousand people who are being forced to go through a necessary hurdles to prove their bona fide east but the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine counties thousands of volunteering paid poll workers who are going to be asked to substantially verify that these ideas are sufficient and the challenges there is this this is the subject of standards\nIt would be much easier if he actually did his job\nAnd process people in a proper fashion and we did not have the ... system\n[noise] uh your reaction to that uh the the law that requires matching matching from a licenses driver's licenses to voter rolls\nThey claim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising or suppressing the ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell no this was a ... law but I Am following state law that we have in Georgia for clarification process because we believe in we should do not support this that we should bear of a\nNew individuals are before we register to vote that's why we have a stick or a citizenship check this flight we have when you get your driver's license in our state\n... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand for re election as governor Nathan Deal they did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now\nWe had record turnout Donald Trump was elected in Georgia most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that voters suppression\nRight before this outrageous claim came we announced that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before in the state of Georgia\nBecause we have things like online voter registration up push through the general assembly and implemented a secretary of state ... years ago we have eight thousand more people on our roles now than we hit had when I took office she voted against on line voter registration she does not support our common sense\nPhoto ID law she voted against our citizenship to\nThe counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because the information from her local groups is not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license and they can vote so that is not a high hurdle for people to do but they can't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper pipe or register to vote and if they used our own line system they never had any of this problem\nTo start with so she's blaming me for a problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law and that's why I think Georgia voters are a lot smarter than she gives them credit for they're going to see the smoke screen this all they're doing this to drop their base out\nBut it's working in reverse 'cause the Republican base\nAnd hard work and Georgia's are going to reject a solo on November the ...\nAh well the the argument is that well if you have a letter missing in your name that fits like Laura ... versus Laura Ingraham than your your vote will be set aside is that accurate\nThat is not that is absolutely not accurate\nOkay so how is a matching take place like as they say that to be a one is a substantial match\nOr something to the from the ... your license your driver's license to your the voter rolls her\n[noise] well Hello Mr ...

policy hard time\nUh breaking through with that message in a big way it's not been the defining issue of the mid term elections and so there is this sense and you see it with hardliners as a sort of regular bitter American politics now that they feel like if we're more outrageous we do something that's that's more offensive or controversial maybe that will create a run right\nOr because he really is in touch with the people on immigration right it's not a big issue let me give you some facts here before we get to our guests are the Gallup\nPoll the latest a big poll on the top issue for us voters\nWas back in July\nOr twenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and is the highest percentage naming at issue in Gallup history\nAnd asking the most important or when they asked the most important problem question\nUh again mentioned immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup as an asking the question on generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\n... goes on and on about this uh a Reuters episodes poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration and their biggest concern topping economic performance and health care immigration and the writers ... was the top issue\nI did a he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia fifth congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a the latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released\nCongress men I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nWell every time we passed the bill or something massive funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out from underneath the president who wants to keep its promises of securing the border your lead and bumper\nWhere the gentleman that I use that term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words and I'd like for something to do explain to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because\nEssentially what they've done it said if you don't want to open borders than you are mean\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand that very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and why is it that Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as it relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nJust goes wild and let me tell you about something that happened Congress man this is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had\nThe opportunity terrain and these ... ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear a categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect\nOn certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no\nAnd domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a ... a democratic ah in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives for Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they've decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do there\nWhoa Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think that moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who rung you um and and so you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's listening right that's a joke I'm but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house and maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nI got to the upside you know that the Republicans might act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans are who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse but when I said\nIs right UC UC leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now\nI fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in as speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters and in\nTwenty Eighteen I mean God Bless all around I like um a lot but I you know there's going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnd Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that that didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change the stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught\nAnd ultimately released because we do not have the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWorld are prosecuted for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge on any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the Clinton emanates from El Salvador oh that is why they're saying we're feared alien abduction but that doesn't mean that it's actually happening\nYeah well again I think that's you and you seemed you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people or you know like we we got cities with with the homeless a villages tent villages we got a veteran veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point ... we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that\nYou take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with a with rage about the situation\nA congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV than will take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate or against affirmative action don't go to\n\nBill O'Riley here my new book

a\nDiscrimination scheme I in fact Harvard zone admissions data shows that\nAre an internal team who did they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury their board that's on trial right now and uh one important point I Want to make your audience today is that\nHarvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell how am I so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be swimming and money uh but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism type of racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination I and the Supreme Court's Fisher decision um you know affirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism\nUm and it it she has a huge impact on its missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America\nOr is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities fold the students most would would cite diversity is a founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be a Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right ah but you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to do this to the point I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out\nUCLA the school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and I learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without ...\nMissions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education just let people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition hum to your point of view would say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nOdd that we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete a based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well this genie park who's

fairness\nIncrease opportunities increase there are the\nBetter for everyone which is good for Asian Americans as well\nUh your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard gloss like her\nWho is a harsh shoot at Harvard or who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America who got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those vehicles spoke at the Asian American coalition\nFor educations Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in ... there is a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down\nUh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action uh so because we have this powerful allies who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think that India and we may prevail\n... this is how they're going to go on for some time on the federal district court level than a court of appeals and ah if they determine a circuit split on this to the Supreme Court um VJ this is fascinating\nYou're on TV you gotta come on TV with us soon or VJ and I'm not his book almost black the true story of how I got
