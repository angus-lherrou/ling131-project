going on with hurricane Michael strongest on records of humble the Florida Panhandle\nAnd it is a be a monster and this is where you learn from something what they've learned from Andrew they've taken into the Murray isn't the Florence's and all the other ones that have hit and it is served them well\nAnd right now a it is it for some it it is serving them very well and it is still ugly and it's going to be weeks and months of digging out for a lot of these people and some people they're gonna have to rebuild completely\nAnd others it is going to be a more than just a little bit of an inconvenience it's gonna be a bit of a nightmare for a couple of months but uh\nUh I think in the end you know the fact that we're not hearing about massive loss of life\nJust shows you how well prepared and how amazing is when you look around the country at the globe and there are incidents where there's an earthquake or something ah and and how we the west\nModern times and in certain places around the globe and uh we handle things in ways that just other countries don't I think it it is it is really amazing speaking of handling things again we're moving towards the midterms\nHealth care and the cost of healthcare it's been ignored and it's driving me crazy that all of these things and today Trump did\nThat that I like I absolutely again I you know when he drives me crazy at times but I'm an action person and when you put the you start to do things that you show action and he's keeping some of his promise to some of them\nYou know what he drives me crazy at times but I'm an action person when you put the ... you start to do things that you show action and he's keeping some of his promise to some of them like some of my head but he's doing what I I think he's trying to do some stuff that's real and I think he's taking on these drug companies in the way that they've not seen before\nTwo new laws will remove a gag order preventing pharmacist from telling you how to pay lower prices on prescription drugs that silence forced by some health insurance companies which sometimes inflated the prices and pocket the difference is the cost of doing business President Trump says no more\nThis gives people knowledge as to prices have different locations drug\nInsurers say those gag order price contracts were rare farmers who say\nThey aren't [noise] yeah yeah of course they're going to say it's rare but\nI like this and this is something that won't be talked about he's not going to get the credit for but the rising cost of health care because we had in two thousand Nineteen people are trying to figure out how they roll enroll for this that and the other and they're looking at prices in sticker shock is coming again and that that this Congress has done very little to sort any of this stuff out\nAnd it needs to be sorted out and drug issues when you talk to a lot of people\nDrug prices because it is an ongoing thing a lot of ways is the stuff that thinks people it is yes massive heart attack cancer and things like that but it's the other stuff on on the on the massive side of things that is the day to day in month a month for the masses\nThat is a real struggle for people and if you if we can get to this point we're starting to again competition is great if we start finding ways capitalistic ways to approach this thing I think we can totally do this I think we can come at it in a way that hasn't been done before\nAnd it's not going to make everybody happy but right now we have isn't working and it\nIs going to be very interesting I never begrudge the drug companies for making money because my my thing is you put the risk out there\nAnd the cost of doing business the cost of getting a drug through here and realized there's a lot of country a lot of of our drugs around the globe are used they're not throwing up their money like we are cheaper elsewhere why is that well it's a game here\nThe price of prescription drugs way out of whack way through I I've been talking about it for a long time long before I ever decided to run for president\nYeah yeah and and I think this is a a a good step but it's a first step but there's many other steps that need to be approached and looked at and I think we've got to start thinking outside the box I Do the Democrats won a single payer for for everybody and you know is how do we pay for that\nThat's the big thing how do we pay for that who else 'cause you're not going to get rid of the insurance companies\nSo how does that work who gets paid what how much does it cost everybody wears the value added tax gonna come to that that's going to be a national tax all of these kinds of things that are going to be thrown onto us there's ways that we can go about doing but at the Republicans don't start coming up with ideas of eventually\nThey're going to lose\nAnd their their hand is going to be forced and we're going to be like this isn't what we want it well you better start coming up with ideas\nYou better do\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned show is your Twitter [noise]\nThey did a video like four years

Sellars is politician now remember we have to be civil says Hillary Clinton\nWhat Kanye West of done with Donald Trump is what other people have done who gravitated in his in his orbit which has just shower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but the my issue was kind of us is quite simple um it's that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool\nAnd Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about our our issues that are that are central issues and many African American communities are very important issues but the fact is we're not the main Kanye West to the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the deaths too\nSo so he's ... he's an idiot right he's an idiot but wait he he again it's all about civility\n... what is what happens when it was as what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who's been with him and say\nWow no ...\nYou have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who's been with me and say pitchers\nWhile no Kanye West is what happens when she goes against that mob rule and that mentality of will they need to be civil so you come out and say that this is what happens when a when black people don't read right\nThis is what happens with black and ... this is what how this is the thing that meet the makes that makes me laugh\nAnd they're the ones out there saying oh we need to be ... ... they're not civil to us they're not nice to stay there is no civility you can't reason when they when they look at you and like I can look at somebody say I may not agree with your politics but I don't think you're evil\nRight I think Charles crime or said you know one side may not agree with the politics and that's where it goes the other side they just think you're evil\nAnd that's the problem we have they don't like him because he's not going along step to toe and goose stepping to all the BS that they're pushing out there they don't like him they look at him as an he's an Uncle Tom ridge consulting with the enemy that's how they look at him\nThat's why it's interesting for people on the right because it's not the norm\nRight the norm is to go to the American Music Awards or to the Oscars or to the Grammys and to just be little half of the country and the president and get cheers for to go on cold there and all these kinds of things he's not like that\nRight he likes Canada so and for whatever reason he he he stands by people that you think and he does it in the day and age when it's not cool\nAnd sit there and say he's an idiot\nHe's crazy I mean it's a little bit crazy I mean he's with tradition for God's sakes this little bit of that\nRight 'cause every guy that ends up getting with the court asking seems at some point in time to lose it if they don't run out of there fast enough but that is the thought process so they scream about being civil when when the reality is is all the while they're saying to be civil they're anything but civil\nAnd this is the problem with us in America today so this is why we can't have normal conversation\n'cause the people who have the microphones don't want to have normal conversations they want to be just as much a bully\nAs they claim they're fighting against\nThree two three five three eight twenty four twenty three ...

when it's on one of the content of this advertising on the right candidate for the Arizona desert or\nWhen you\n\nAre on\n[noise]\nYou're today's headlines saying you just start gene Tucson boarding do wonky UGA\n\nAt one for sure I'm I'm assuming from cheerios Lucy Mercer job three to\nSix or are you going to be\nOn the on the show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course now it's Donald Trump doesn't care about the victims\nThat which is which is nonsense I mean it's very clear that the\nPresident and his entire team had been working very closely with the governors of Florida Alabama and Georgia and I think it an appropriate time the president will go down to visit but as you know a head he tried to go down last night it would have been a nightmare because\nThat would avert all ... all of the various workers away from what they should be doing to trying to take care of the president's state so he'll get their president but I also want to see just whatever Donald Trump does\nHe's gonna be attacked\nThese people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know he's done something terrible what is it and that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the friends the ah has gotten to a point knew that when I was talking to folks say yesterday who were in Washington in the Nineteen sixty eight riots after\nMartin Luther king and Robert Kennedy uh both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nYeah I think I think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through Watergate you had a\nMemory at a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed a new is a very bitter very divisive time uh but I think after that uh we\nMore normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said it wasn't inaccurate shot some people but she's basically right or when we're point\nOr somebody like a justice cabin all\nIt's because we want to return to a constitutionally based\nCourt system that uses the American system as this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result if your a left wing a Democrat we we we're at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately to change America and now\nThe American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously good or blow for the\nUh people who who thought up into election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton was going to when they go at the two justices you've got\nAnd hell or even ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you or Larry ... who of course famously bombed in his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this production for them in terms\nOf the air has ever been and abnormal presidency where he had it\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is they can be sued ami it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nAh what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe right but it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just one hey you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic ah and we won the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOf how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona's now heads or how come that uh Kramer the Republican candidate in\nNorth Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points or in his in ah\nTennessee is people to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system branch and starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up acting remotely I'm just getting a sense of\nYou know something out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races\nAnd some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum versus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for some any of watch the growth of Florida and how well it's been a run by Rick Scott\nAnd and to the idea of turning that state over is critical is that state in the country electoral politics to a guy who was basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen then yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nI mean Gillum is uh\nThe latest great hope because he came out of nowhere as a radical Democrat or he won an upset primary victory or eat\nThe key temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember as a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one\nOf the ten highest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win and landslides and the reason is exactly why we're building a majority in the country\nThey get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas\nAnd I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign\nThat drives home again and again and again the difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that or not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work and I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results in resistance\nAnd certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of a resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nA I think that's I\nThink people like that they had not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds on what I get that but I think the this frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides and I\nSo I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this ... thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup ah so that's my sense of it in holders comments Maxine Waters\nI don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\nWell and I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible your jobs being created your lowest\nBlack on unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so Everytime you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out um people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George Soros and others actually pay for them or which doesn't you know does that justify him\nBut the whole system that the left has tried to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nI Know you're doing a lot of uh a\nVent before the midterm elections and there's one on October Fifteen or where you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and you'll be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what is it\nSo how do people end up ah attending this do they do and and and let

political with their own agenda\nThey were so taken in by the allure by the patter by the look of the Obamas they miss the deeper policies that were undermining the very communities and the safety at the end the prison reform and all the things that they really wanted to they didn't get done and write that it'll get done\nThis is what my my my wake up call to everybody would be let's talk policy if we're talking politics and separate the Rasul dazzle from it because that distracts us All right there are a lot going on that Trump's doing good for the black community and and they might not be good but let you evaluate him on that\nWant to distract from the success so they can whip people up and do a perpetual state of her age and then they think\n...

kind of\nPeel back another layer the onion about how liberal ... the media don't give a rip about minorities you said you said they want a mano climatic voting bloc they do because it's a means to an end that and is absolute power\nI think it's it's always been about power and the power is to change the American social construct\nThey want to destroy the foundations of this country so they can rebuild it and the way that they think it should have been built in the first place they hate the founding of this country they think the country was founded on corrupt principles and a corrupt way that it was that from the American Indians and the Mexicans and it's now time to restore the order\n\n\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Ginny cell sunspot correct her

through\nThe roof 'em and very happy with that although I'm working harder than I wanted to work\nOut in the know spins zone a podcast on Bill O'Reilly ... dot com and of course ah you know bills of books are among the best selling books of all time in literature and history a bill\nI Want to talk about what you see because you know one of the smartest political analysts out there with all your experience reporting over decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse\nThan um you expected and are we approaching perhaps a Nineteen sixty eight style a type of frenzy in the streets\nWere bought or beyond that now I think it's the worst that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career yeah basically a nexus of uh the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement ever seen in this country ever in the history of the country so you have\nGuys like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money we're basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depending on what they're told to do [noise]\nUm you have now a bevy of organizations so he saw it in a cabinet hearings that send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things\nYou know to confront senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner do these aren't accidents are right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nAccident mhm okay so you have this and\nThe past journalism reporters would have investigated it because this huge money behind it but they don't now instead they promote it\nThey're in business with the radical left in business with them\nCNN and MSNBC make money lots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling\nOf this ah the star and the way he's addressed it has been healthful has it been illuminating\n\nI don't think he knows what's going on the way I just laid it out\nTo you and your listeners\nAre just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness ... whenever you have organizations that are in the shadows that people never\nHeard of I'll give you one color of change Mm All right and you've got\nTwenty of them\nAnd they take their orders from big money to radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted senator\nFlake and the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous all this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's not what's happening and you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods\nAnd there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested wasn't engaged and the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than than a\nWhat we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause a George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editor to the New York times but not much [noise]\nSo this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was leaked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nFBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they started that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all the women are lying by the way they were all lying\nTo I had a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now new two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm All right and and I saw\nThings leveled against me that were insane\nAnd ah you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to make a decision right the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got capital they almost got him and this is kind of country why\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nExcept that because it's been in Plano for quite some time so who do you depend on to get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system\nAnd I'll put forth a that President Trump should really see a bigger picture he picks everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights like presumption of innocence you process which you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say no matter\nThe presumption of innocence if somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty\nBecause in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have and have that\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing\nAnd I think ... I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nTell I Am I Am petrified of this I ... I completely agree with you and\nI was slammed the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my true this\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the to the curb denounced um put up on a Christ crucified lose a promotion\nThis has got to stop that 'cause I got to have anybody well and it had happened it happened to me at ... obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation in in one Syracuse is something where do you do to get your information that way\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this cabinet mess my new column posted on Bill O'Reilly dot com as it is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how are your truth has replaced the truth\nOkay so and I and I take it off the University of North Carolina which now wants to honor Christine for 'em and and I I've I never comment on a doctor for one way or the other because I don't know what happened\nI'm I'm I'm interested in the people behind her ... you know I first got flag to this when she her letter was league and the media at least she hired the most radical left attorneys in the country and I said to myself if you're a victim", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "11"}
