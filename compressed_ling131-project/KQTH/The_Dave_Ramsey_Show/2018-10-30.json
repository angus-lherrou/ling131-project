long a lot of folks failed to recognize you served a purpose like I said we use called them killer whales\nBeings the fight over her captivity has been going on that long but a lot of folks failed to recognize you served a purpose like I said we use called them killer whales and back then the public didn't have a positive view or cause that we do today\nLolita helped popularize her own species and

played top she's articulate and she's smart\nAnd she got the reward of sitting in the White House and having the president wish her well as she leaves her post I can understand why should want to do it she's got teenage kids at home and she spent six years as a state governor which means she's been tied up with government while her kids have been getting older\nI understand her desire to go home now the United states need somebody equally tough to take her job and start to represent the United states there and be tough with some of the bullies because believe me that United Nations

of politics and shaping the world around us in ways that I don't think people understand\nAnd the ...\nYou know the Google's the Twitter the the Facebook or going to become a huge player bigger players than they already are\nIn shaping the way we're going and I was talking to a producer Anthony earlier so you think about it I I was watching uh I think it's got out and Dilbert I got this job and he said you know the Trump in many ways maybe our last Schumann president and the sense that will have a human president but that presidents ideas may be shaped by analytics\nAnd how the social media world feels about certain things\nSo if they believe it to be good then they'll get on the path of this is the right thing to do if they believe it to be wrong than they are going to take their shoes along the way from social media and that's scary but I think that's becoming more and more true absolutely analytics just let's just say look let's just break things down\nSports which is right it's it's it's it is if there's anything that as a meritocracy in this world it is sports\nOver the last Twenty years analytics it's gotten into sports where the Dodgers albeit lost the world series their team they kept their for best hitters on the bench for\nSeveral of these playoff games and throughout the year because of analytics told them to they got to the world series\nThe red Sox when they started this great run in two thousand seven and and you know reverse the personal nine yards all analytics baseball football's becoming analytics basketball's becoming analytics everything is becoming analytics why shouldn't and politics has been heading there\nBut imagine building candidates specifically based on analytics\nAnd I think we're going to get more and more of that\nUh and I think the human side of politics is gonna is gonna be taken out and that's something that that people are going to I'm I'm telling you guys we're gonna have to start understanding of the way this is going and how big these companies are and when they're echo chambers\nOf really only one belief an ideology that to me can be very scary speaking of a midterms\nSupreme Court nomination process was something that impacted my decision making things where you have big news so there's a lot of people that are\nThey don't over the things that has to be covered wages do increase along with the cost of living never seen red\nTide not like you don't want unpack far from here talking to brown and black voters\nAre supporting the President Trump's message and his agenda that's largely why came out today if you could send a message or whatever [noise] um [noise] things need to change cut all the BS out of everything ... get it together we\nAre one that than and time to put our politics tied up to the plate hole up your pants and let's get to work and get them all\nYeah that all sounds great but you know the reality is is\nThere's money and have there's money and discord a politics the beauty of politics they never want to give up what they have which is power\nWhich is the absolute power\n\nWhy would you but when you got something now\nIn many ways I mean normally big business goes to court power what\nBut when you got something now that in many ways I mean normally big business goes to court power where do they go\nThey go to Washington DC they bring their money with them and they say hey we want to court power you guys are the Dukes and the Dutch uses the royals of our time and for us to court favorite with you we must then give you stuff\nWe must we must give you a tribute and that's what they do get some of that power given to them as well but now you're going to have something that is more powerful than even them which is the way to control information\nWhich will help them so rather than going to them they can say hey we're you know we're able to control the flow of information and that control in itself is more powerful than what you guys do 'cause we can disseminate information the way that we see fit\nWe have thousands upon thousands hundreds of thousands of engineers that are doing these things\nSo much so that they don't even understand the analytics they're putting together this is a big thing\nThis is so while we as human beings maybe going we want this one that we look at social media and the way that things go anywhere you see what it takes and social media it doesn't take millions it takes a few to to to create such a skirt\nAs to force changes in companies in all kinds of things that's scary I said it last week man I continue that I've talked\nTo several politicians who've said that they fear not their entire constituent base but a few who have power and influence inside of social media that can be held for them\nAnd many of those people that may be helping them have very little to do if anything with their constituents and the basis where they are but that fear factor is real and I think this is going to be a bigger play and then when you've got things like\nShadow banning and you've got things like you know the ... you post something on the Internet that seems to be completely you know it's a noxious ... but they deem it to be bad\nAnd they pull you off of there and freedoms and speech oh it's going to be crazy three two three five three twenty four twenty three that you had mentioned shows your Twitter you can tweet us ... king of crazy Hillary Clinton\nHe want to run again no [laughter] no upon why well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nSo she wants to be president but she doesn't want to run she just wants to be [noise] if there's any way you could just to point me president that'd be super\nWhen we have a Democrat in the oval\nOffice in January I'm twenty Twenty one there's going to be so much work to be done I mean we have confuse everybody in the world including ourselves we confuse our friends and our enemies like\nThey have no idea what the United States stands for what we are likely to do what we think is important and so the work with the work that I feel very well prepared for having\nBending aside for eight years having been a diplomat or in the state department and it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting a you going to be doing any of that let's say they're failing oh I have\nNo idea ... I'm not going to even think about going to get through this on November ... election\nYeah yeah she is a well she's perfect for the the whole thought process of of of analytic she's kind of a robot somebody said jet so you just think they're going to be actors I think there'll be what they're going to be is there no longer going to have their own fault\nAs far as they have their ideas the other views there still be human\nBut their views will be more based on what's taking place on social media and how the information is being shaped at how people feel about it than the actual views they have they may believe in\nAnd what's taking place on social media and how the information is being shaped at how people feel about it\nThan the actual views they have they may believe in something and they find out that social media is telling the analytics don't jibe with what you believe in care so as we all know both sides of the aisle will pivot as they see necessary because it's more important to hang on to power than it is anything else so the analytics will drive their viewpoints\nMore than their actual viewpoints themselves some of their viewpoints they match up\nAnd be popular\nIn the social sphere but some of them may not three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned show is your Twitter you can tweet us love hearing from you ...\n[noise]\nWith your Mayo Clinic radio helped minute unchecked open up a pretty easy getting rid of the real ones can be difficult\nIt's all voluntary contraction up a diaphragm followed by closure of the vocal chords that leads to that characteristic sound\nGastroenterologist Dr Mark Larson says most hiccup triggers are associated with temporary bloating stomach\nThat might be overeating or rapidly eating\nHe says gulping down big drinks especially carbonated ones can cause hiccups even being suddenly excited or scared can cause that repetitive involuntary contraction of a diaphragm\nMost people who experience pickup according to so for all we have a very short period of time usually less than men are rarely pickups can last for days or even months that may be a clue that there's underlying medical condition\nAs for halting to hiccups Dr Larson suggest simple remedies such as holding your breath gurgling or simply sipping on cold water for more information talk with your health care provider orbited Mayo Clinic dot org\nHas fallen asleep become a nightmare for you do you dream of getting a full night's rest boy am I going to have those days are long behind me\nBased on my pillow I'm sleeping like a baby these days and so can you my pillow adjust to the shape you want and need tossed those flat worn out pillows and letting my pillow change the way you sleep wherever they're the one and only solution to your sleepless nights my pillows are made right here in the usa with a hundred percent machine washable and tribal caught and\nAnd I'm like those other pillows my pillow comes with a ten year warranty you're not going to find a deal like this anywhere else by one my pillow get the second one ... that's right when you order one my pillow\nYou'll get the second one free get to my pillows for the price of one call eight hundred Ninety three forty nine Seventy five\nOr go to my pillow dot com used promo code Benson that's my fellow dot com promo ...

movie tickets access\nIs\nGoing to be an ever present part of politics\nAnd shaping the world around us in ways that I don't think people understand\nAnd the ...\nYou know the Google's the Twitter the the Facebook are going to become a huge player bigger players than they already are\nIn shaping the way we're going and I was talking to a producer Anthony earlier so you think about it I I was watching a Scott Adams Dilbert got just Dilbert and he said you know that Trump in many ways maybe our last June when president and the sense that will have a human president but that presidents ideas may be shaped by analytics\nAnd how the social media\nWorld feels about certain things so if they believe it to be good then they'll get on the path of this is the right thing to do if they believe it to be wrong than they are going to take their shoes along the way from social media and that's scary but I think that's becoming more and more true\nAbsolutely analytics just let's just say for the look let's just break things down\nSports which is right it's it's it's it is if there's anything that is a meritocracy in this world is sports\nOver the last Twenty years analytics have gotten into sports where the Dodgers albeit lost the world series their team they kept their for best hitters on the bench for several of these playoff games and throughout the\nThe world series their team\nThey kept their for best hitters on the bench\nFor several of these playoff games and throughout the year because of analytics told him to they got to the world series\nThe red Sox when they started this great run in two thousand seven and and you know reverse the personal nine yards all analytics baseball football's becoming analytics basketball's becoming analytics everything is becoming analytics why shouldn't and politics has been heading there but imagine building candidates specifically based on analytics\nAnd I think we're going to get more and more of that\nUh and I think the human side of politics is gonna is gonna be taken out and that's something that that people are going to I'm I'm telling you guys we're gonna have to start understanding the way this was going and how big these companies are and when they're echo chambers\nOf really only one belief an ideology that to me can be very scary speaking of of midterms\nSupreme Court nomination process was something that impacted my decision making things where you have big news is there's a lot of people that are\nThey don't over the things that has to be covered wages do increase along with the cost of living never seen that\nRed tide not like you don't win and tech person less here talking to brown and black voters\nAre supporting the President Trump's message and his agenda that's largely why I came out today if you could send a message or whatever [noise] um [noise] things need to change got all the BS out of everything dream as far as I get it together\nWe are one that than and time to put our politics tied up to the plate pull up your pants and let's get to work and get the song\nYeah that all sounds great but you know the reality is is\nThere's money and have their money and discord a politics is the beauty of politics they never want to give up what they have which is power\nWhich is the absolute power why would you\nBut when you got something now that in many ways I mean normally big business goes to court power where do they go\nThey go to Washington DC they bring their money with them and they say hey we want to court power you guys are the Dukes and the Dutch uses the royals of our time and for us to court favor with you we must then give you stuff\nWe must we must give you tribute and that's what they do get some of that power given to them as well but now you're going to have something that is more powerful than even them which is the way to control information\nWhich will help them so rather than going to them they can say hey we're you know we're able to control the flow of information and that control in itself is more powerful than what you guys do 'cause we can disseminate information the way that we see fit we have thousands upon thousands hundreds of thousands of engineers that are doing these things\nSo much so that they don't even understand the analytics they're putting together this is a big thing this is\nSo while we as human beings maybe going we want this we want that we look at social media and the way that things go anywhere you see what it takes in social media it doesn't take millions it takes a few to do to create\nSuch a skirt as to force changes in companies in all kinds of things that's scary I said it last week man I continue that I've talked\nSeveral politicians who've said that they fear not their entire constituent base but a few who have power and influence inside of social media that can be held for them and many of those people that may be helping them\nA base but a few who have power and influence inside of social media that can be held for them\nAnd many of those people that may be helping them have very little to do if anything would their constituents and the basis where they are but that fear factor is real and I think this is going to be a bigger play and then when you've got things like\nShadow banning and you've got things like you know the ... you post something on the Internet that seems to be completely you know it's a noxious ... but they deem it to be bad\nAnd they pull you off of there and freedoms and speech oh it's going to be crazy three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned shows your Twitter you can tweet at us thinking of crazy Hillary Clinton\nYou want to run again no [noise] no because why well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nSo she wants to be president but she doesn't want to run she just wants to be [noise] if there's any way you could just to point me president that'd be super\nWhen we have a Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one there's going to be so much work to be done I mean we have confused everybody in the\nWorld including ourselves we confuse our friends and our enemies like they have no idea what the United States stands for what we are likely to do what we think is important and so the work with the work that I feel very well prepared for having\nNone of that for eight years having been a diplomat or in the state department and it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting a you going to be doing that let's say they're failing all I have no idea ... I'm not going to even think about going to get through this on November ... election\nYeah yeah she is a well she's perfect for the the whole thought process of of of analytic she's kind of a robot somebody said chat so you just think they're going to be actors I I think there'll be what they're going to be is there no longer going to have their own fault\nAs far as they have their ideas have their views are still be human\nBut their views will be more based on what's taking place on social media and how the information's being shaped at how people feel about it\nThan the actual views they have they may believe in something and they find out that social media is telling the analytics don't jibe with what you believe in here so as we all know both sides of the aisle will pivot as they see necessary because it's more important to hang on to power than it is another thing else so the analytics will drive their viewpoints\nMore than their actual viewpoints themselves some of their viewpoints may match up\nAnd be popular\nIn the social sphere but some of them may not three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and show is your Twitter you can tweet us love hearing from your hey can't wait to get honestly my Batman I this week and I traveled a lot this weekend\nAnd my my back knows because a lot of driving a lot of sleeping on bad mattresses tonight will be on my Casper my back thanks you Casper Casper is incredible it's a no brainer you should absolutely one hundred percent switch here's what they're doing a hundred percent\nA hundred days rich free in your own home\nYou don't like if you like chat I tried it I didn't like it I Want to send it back Casper says go ahead do\nRisk free that's what ... you try and your own home you're not getting that anywhere else not getting that anywhere else\nHere's a great thing they delivered to you comes into tiny box you like there's no way there's a mattress in are you open it up the mattress pops up but it's amazing it's heavy you put it on your bed you sleep like you'd never slept before you sleep cooler and if you like me you wake up your back and your body doesn't hurt that's what's incredible thirty five thousand five stars reviews on all their products Casper\nGoogle Amazon you get where I'm going with this flight risk free right now in your own or to Casper dot com use my promo co jets 'cause they'd be fifty bucks on that\nGoogle Amazon you get where I'm going with this flight risk free right now in your own Casper\nDot com use my promo jets 'cause they'd be fifty bucks on the purchase selected mattresses Casper dot com coach at ... dot com Kojak turns of conditions applied at your best to chose your Twitter C.

about it very hot and it is wrapped up and they connotations of a sudden this aggressiveness of dominance of one race on one country over another\nIs that the way you view the word nationalist when you hear Trump talking nationalism do you think Trump is as the BBC's Katty Kay thing there and MSNBC Trump is using the quote dog whistle [noise]\nOkay oh you racist out their vote for me is that what he's saying [noise]\nTerrific book written um and it was just it just came out recently by your um has any called the virtue of nationalism and his point\nIs that he's a conservative Israeli writer and a political therapy Faris\nAnd his point is that nationalism as properly understood this post World war two or twenty first century nationalism is merely stating that country's deserve to have a their focus on themselves in order to keep their own\nIdentity and culture intact so Japan is Japan nationalist will gas because Japan has tight immigration but they also believe and the Japanese culture that there's something unique and beautiful about it\nAnd they're not constantly passing judgment on others but for Japan they want to preserve their history their culture their language all those things that they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and this is applies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nAnd includes the free speech freedom to worship right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the less has to grab onto these terms if Obama said the word nationalist and explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with it but it's Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the laugh they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen all the second migrant migrant caravan has entered Mexico according to Fox is just broke paleo so Trump can't talk about that either can't talk about the assaults on Mexican police I guess either okay\nOh let's go to James in Florida on line three James welcome\n... hey Laura\nLet me tell you that was the best interview I've ever seen the president thank you nice job last night at all the points it must have been very exciting for you to be in front of a bank us today but I I have to tell you that this is a joke\nThis is another thing from the left they knew this was coming these people only here for economic reasons everybody knows it\nAnd the fact that he wants to stop this anchor baby goes right along with it and I wish she'd signed that executive order today\nWell again we're going to get into the birthright citizenship issue another issue that the leftist completely botched and some Republicans have totally botched as well we've been talking about this issue for almost Twenty years ah All right we're going to all your calls a congressman Dave Brat is also going to join us he's in the fight of his political life I remember\nCame onto the scene when he unseated Eric Cantor a this was back in\nNow he's in the fight of his political life I remember brat came onto the scene when he unseated Eric Cantor now this was back in a twenty fourteen and now he's up against the far left a woman who uh thinks she's going to be able to take that seat because of the redistricting that's happened\nA but we're going to I'm going to fight to the finish on this one as well congressman Dave Brat will be with us and your phone calls eight five five forty Laura who are the new sensors now\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule that though I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a message or brain ... which of the brain and stroke\nA black that's what they do the last week of the Tampa Bay so we got to get everybody to get out and vote to keep the economy moving forward on immigration my opponent is that you know\nSo we got to get everybody to get out and vote to keep the economy are moving forward on immigration my\nOpponent has said you know she's ... uh open borders but we're sanctuary cities even worse and she won't come out and said I directly but she says let the local law enforcement deal with it you know the caravan\nOr the catch and release the let local law enforcement to see how that comes from federal law enforcement and doesn't know the basic provisions of the constitution for federal law enforcement\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law is outdated\nOr we're just going to make it up as we go and that that is a very dangerous new direction or that are no Americans want to move in that direction and so what we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the Bernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar socialist healthcare pays ... ending Medicare is you know it\nDoubled tax rates personal and corporate\nThat put you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction it it it's just like you said it forward versus backward\nWell here's what I see happening on the left and I would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and force then here for a mass\nShooter [laughter] I mean it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left is absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table\nThat Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you are way ahead of the curve on this\nWas the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the left so once\nThey want they want is kind of take those issues away and I neutralized tromp on the campaign trail and probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] yeah and that won't work immigration you know it's Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told not to mention it right by all the ... there's an article in the hill yesterday the Democrats you know just are just sarcastically\nCaving on these issues and just saying you know well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why starting out there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues in immigration is I think the issue especially in my district\nSo yeah you're right that the kids were loading up what Twenty one trillion in debt\nAnd then catch and release you know these are all children of God coming across the border right like the cat which are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted at all or any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill right so you run those basic issues by that by the taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off is that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nAnd we don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation\nOr the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you know do grow the economy\nI taught college for Twenty years last the Obama period a high end college graduates couldn't go out by the decent job and now it it's just day and night that the time is just boom and the kids are getting multiple job offers one statistic what's really interesting it's just the job of ability [laughter] people are leaving their jobs\nBecause they are that confident and go get a better job it's been a long time since that's happened and so are the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know ... and ... it's just great news and so we ... we got to share that with everybody but there is a group that\nYou know it it it it's just great news and so we what we got to share that with everybody but there is a group that is just dug in on the resistance right we're offering result they want to resist like you said right they want to have enlisted best vacations they want to page the president impeach cabin all my opponent won't come down on any of\nThat of course not so what does she hiding I mean you know the question I asked him his final final days why why is she hiding well\nWhy is that why is your challenger\nMitt spanberger hiding on these key issues in the the voters or Virginia deserve to know the truth\nAbout what she really believes about the changing nature of of the state the the economic burdens being laid at the feet of the taxpayers of Virginia but she's answering and be glib cliches\nAnd ... to make us every everyone's going to feel good but that's not how the real world works she needs to answer these questions and why she hiding I Would keep saying that we're issue why she hiding\nRight right one of the things she hired and came out months ago and of course the mainstream press a let her high ... worked at a a Saudi a school she calls it an embassy school the only problem with that there is the U.S government shut it down under Chuck Schumer and congressman Israel because it\nAnti Semitic anti American anti woman\nThere was a far right while hobby fundamentalists Saudi training school that produced terrorists\nAnd after the fact she says she's still proud that you work there but like you said if you're proud of the fact that you worked at this school that is they hate school then\nWhy didn't you put that on your resume she's hiding everything she tidy or policy platform she's hiding her position on healthcare immigration taxes she won't talk about in public because you know they're losers with the people of the seventh district in Virginia\nI Want to play a ... I Want to play somebody for you this is from Joe Lockhart Clinton's old press secretary again words in subjects that they want to take off the table before this uh mid term vote let's listen\nHe's still talking about global is um which is a dog whistle for a for a semi he's still going after George Soros another dog was over anti Semite\nDonald Trump doesn't change um he might have moments where he reads the paper in front of him but he will change I mean if if if the largest slaughter of American Jews in American history\nWon't change his attitude and his rhetoric nothing will well I got it yeah it\nIt it sounds different from Joe Lockhart but it's someone who was on CNN with Allison ... ah but I don't think that was ... I mean that's the sense that you can't say the word\nGlobal list what why why not I mean that the lessons use the word global is plenty of times but again they are the ... one day if they want to take the college speech code mentality in voice it upon society at large in that way they fix all the debates\nYeah the the left is very good and this goes back decades right they are training manuals they try to take your strength away from you and take away your strongest points right my strongest point is Iran as an outsider I voted that way right my small business score is a hundred percent\nAnd uh I have the support of all the the small business folks across my district that sat or I'd sit around all the counties\nAnd so they're taught to talking points for me is I don't get around and not being paid off by big pharma et cetera\nBut because of an Obamacare vote and so you're you're right that talking point is right they're very smart on how to shift the language they do not want to have a policy debate if your policy debate we'd when it's Ninety ten they have to shifted off to the politics of personal destruction they have a hard time with it\nThey have to ship it off to the politics of personal destruction they have a hard time with me 'cause I went to seminary that no I Love everybody\nAnd so they have a hard time shifting around that way on me and so now they're just running crazy false commercials you know the biggest thing I Can't believe with the national media it it it's it's just horrible the house voted for pre existing conditions right to help people with preexisting conditions\nIt passed the house and that's the number one issue the leftist running on saying we're against it after that was the biggest bill of the year last year which cat got thrown on dream fake news\nUnreal now well Dave Brat a is a is a classic independent thinking Virginian and the type of person who the voters of the seventh district badly need representing them in Washington someone who will not be cowed\nBy the threats from the left and who knows how how injurious it is\nTo the American people to have outside influences try to shut down free speech\nAnd threaten people

K. doesn't allow it to Spain doesn't allow it France doesn't allow it Canada doesn't allow it it other than the United states the only really advanced economy that allows this bingo\nAutomatic citizenship and Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I think it just as a matter of common sense setting aside constitutional\nA language which it does not require a what the left claims that it requires\nA it's it's open to debate it's a fascinating subject are joining us\nNow Mark Krikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura I'm Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this for us Mark I'm the president brings this up\nHigh yesterday and the media that their ... response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle once again\nWell I mean that's to expect and quite frankly but uh the president is I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume is is that he is interpreting\nIt caused within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists\nOr fallen students for illegal aliens that phrase or it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means\nSo it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue\nFor the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue\nIt's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists\nUm our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something to have a constitutional amendment or something but it but the only way to get this process even started\nIt's for the president to do this issue an executive order and what it'll mean is that the state department won't issue passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue\nThe passports for instance to kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue ACLU will find one of them they'll sue and then they'll be a lawsuit that this is\nUm you know whatever you think about this issue or whatever you think the policy should be this is the smart way to ski up the issue so we can move it along in the process of\nYou know public debate because all we're doing now is saying well I think that this senator and Eighteen sixty eight men X. and somebody says no all this other senator and Eighteenth sixty eight meant why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the present\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels a Florida birth motels the Chinese the Russians and Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business just in Russia alone\nOr and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid who has a passport and your golden yeah your gold and\nGet as as a kid has a passport he can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea and turkey who do this\nAs a way of helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have as all it's a retirement plan for some people because you know you're having a kid at thirty well\nBy the time your kid is an adult and has a job and is working if uh you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you're finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this none of which is in the interest of the United states\nNow it's it's fast saying we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a break we're going to highlight one of the key congressional races or that is a winnable seat in New Jersey stay there\n\nOut today on DVD and Blu ray from number one New York times best selling author didn't ask as soon as it comes his latest film death of a nation\n... district of a New Jersey it's an open seat\nOr the current um incumbent Republican Rodney Franklin sin is retiring and this is critical the races very tight uh he's been subject to a violent threat his family has uh just the mere fact that he's running for office in New Jersey\nI and we're delighted to talk to him J uh this is a tight race and your opponent making Cheryl ... is hoping to keep the corruption machine don't I guess in New Jersey just keep that keep the liberal liberal party rule going\nYeah that's their plan certainly I mean anytime you support Bob and ended up for reelection boy that says a lot about where you want to take the country and and what you think of congressional ethics so\nTell us what happened ah yeah I Know you and your family or have been targeted because simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\n[noise] yeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn signs stuck in an envelope and then\nUh enclosed with a a a letter suggesting that um my seven children would be an lucky if I were to win and ah it was you know disturbing a law enforcement fantastic uh they're on the case that are making the kids feel really really safe and secure\nAnd my wife and I look at each other's or what do we do about it we're going to make sure the kids are safe and then a with a push back it was just not going to be intimidated by some ... or drop things in the mail and then a heights so we're going to keep pushing forward and the only way to deal with it just push back and stayed up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nThe district you know what you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump won it by one percent of the media and the left the resistance are geared\nUh the eleventh is a tough district Trump won it by one percent or the media and the left the resistance are\nGeared up their jacked up to try to run the tables in congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy the fundamentals of this economy are incredibly strong\nAh and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district the wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up so early and you'd always jacked up the taxpayers to be getting screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand it and the state has gotten more and more on affordable with\nEvery democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here Jack it up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or measures let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes are the people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax is just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction were drawn and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nHike taxes around here and then the blame somebody else in Washington it's not going to work we're going to Washington to to grow this economy and that support the president's agenda which is working for the country\nAnd you and your wife I think are both uh lawyers or your your I Know you're a lawyer you just you're going to graduate and back in two

been asked to make bigger sacrifices and is to keep our country strong and free and so if that's what we have to do this year to help our country and that's what we're going to do\nA when you look at the national debate and a and the Democrats have funneled millions and millions of dollars into voter outreach registration getting people to the polls\nHave you gotten the assistance that you need a from Republicans and they are and see and others to do the same for the recall\nSince that you need a from Republicans and they are and see and others to do the same for the Republican side\nThey are

loving the Jersey it's a great place but it has been badly served\nBy corrupt leaders corrupt leadership on in mostly in the Democratic side of the equation and the fact that ... mind to Menendez I mean come on and everything in between you got to have some level headed people in the U.S Congress\n[noise] yeah that's the plant and we want we want to go down there and serve and help help of what
