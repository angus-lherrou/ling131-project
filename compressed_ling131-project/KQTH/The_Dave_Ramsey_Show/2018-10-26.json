way prescription drugs or don't want to get into when I talk to people about why is it ... which means if you're in cheaper elsewhere one of the things that that never gets talked about uh\nAnd when I talk to people about why is it just so expensive here and cheaper elsewhere one of the things that that never gets talked about a\nIn a real way is how the rest of the world loves our drugs and likes the fact that essentially they don't have to come up with\nWere taking aim at the global free loading that forces American consumers to subsidize lower prices in foreign countries through higher prices in our country\nYeah there's a reason for a lot of the things that that the countries are able to do is the pharmaceutical companies are over here with the best technology best engineers all of those things and and the best research they go about doing their stuff and when there's a break\nThrough the Europeans and many others get to enjoy all of that why we pay higher cost and that we're like that's crazy but that's\nThe reality of it and it's ... one of the reasons that a lot of places are able to do things in a much cheaper way is because the system and a lot of ways is rigged against\nUs by the very same people who say we want to\nFix it but we did against you\nThe world rapes the benefits of American Genius and innovation well American citizens and especially our great seniors who are hit the hardest pick up the tab but no longer\nThese are the things for the with the shouting and and rightly so the whole bomb thing is something we should pay attention to you\nBut these are the things right here they really do matter for us the high cost\nOf health care is sitting at the top of what is going on in people's mind as we approach this vital mid term south the most ... blushing of all time I think every election the next one is always ...\nBut the reality of what I hear people talking about is not the cost is not about dealing with these kinds of things\nAnd I liked the fact that he takes no he'll never get any kind of real credit for it he would they yesterday the opioid saying he went after the opioids and and and he he came hard at that they signed a brand new prevention and treatment bill but it was a bipartisan bill was absolutely massively bipartisan like\n\nBecause they realize is the problem here but it was overshadowed because of the bombs because a few other things in the fighting amongst each other and because it's not sexy it's not this right here this is something that I think needs to be taken all I Do and I think there's a lot of different ways to do it remember it was I've been talking about all day and I'll continue to say\nMost people on both sides of the aisle they want to go to the same place their path to get there they differ on\nAnd that's the thing that we need to figure out is like how do we get into that path where we're kind of in some of the same lane moving in that direction it's not going to be perfect\n\nBut it's better than just both sitting there idling three two three five three eight twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter tweet at us speaking of the other side of the aisle for a lot of you out there this guy is Gregory what's his name is going to join his next [noise]\nHe uh he's an author yeah big time orphan acts and a comic books like Batman dark night things like that but he's trying to fix the Democrats and he's interesting he's engaging he's got some good ideas and\nSees a lot of the world the way that a lot of other people do but just because there's a de by his name people don't pay attention on the other side well guess what kids a he's a good do and we're going to talk\nPeople do but just because there's a de by his name people don't pay attention on the other side well guess what kids a he's a good do and we're going to talk about stuff here's a guy on the left is willing to come on and I loved that he straight edge adventure Joe\n[noise]\n\nSuch ... Benson show [noise]\n\nAre you fifth year older\nOkay well I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand so don't worry\nBut I Do want to ask you have you sign up for a Mac yet if your answer is no why it's a free membership for one year you don't even have to give them credit card information and just for signing up here's some of the stuff you're going to recede just some forty percent off movie tickets access the supplemental dental plans up the sixty percent off\nAnd they're not feeling like they're represented in either the level of civility or the kind of discourse it's happening or even the views or even frankly if somebody else has an opposing view than you you don't get to look into their hearts and make a moral judgment about the type of human they are you just you should just disagree\nOh absolutely and and and you know as Dr Greg Norman's here is the screenwriter ah\nThe author for the ... and several comic book she would probably familiar with but he's out there helping the Democrats in ... and you're out there helping Democrats who are in in in races in places like Texas where you talked about a guy\nThat is you know guy was what is he an Army Ranger the guy who whose who he's built up a business\nHe is he was everything that you would look when you look at a Democrat you go like that to me is when I look at when I look a Democrat that the Democratic party I used to recognize just like on the right there are some people out there that I recognize that are that used to be the Republican Party the extremes have the bully pulpit\nAnd the problem is as we've now gotten to the point where\nWe no longer look at the other side as somebody I disagree with a on political things we now just look you across the board is you're evil and your the enemy\nAbsolutely and the gentleman who you bring up is it is a great example we'll talk about this names Joseph Kopser he's running into access\nA you know Twenty years in the army he was a ranger he then uh went to the Kennedy School at Harvard got a degree in international relations ... was a professor at West point I mean really impressive guy\nAnd one of the things that he did after that is he went and created a\nA clean energy company which was a huge success he now employs hundreds and hundreds of people in Texas but a really successful entrepreneur he understand small business and for instance when he talks about health care he doesn't talk about it in a way that shaming people who don't have the same view of him who who you know it's gone from the perspective of\nHere's this sick child and how dare you not care about them because I think people who are conservative it's not that they lack empathy for people they're just trying to figure out a system that that makes sense for them and feel sustainable economically\nAnd what's so great with cops are as viewers he's like look I had after Twenty years in the army\nI had a baseline health insurance for myself and that gave me the freedom to go take a leap and to build this business which now created hundreds and hundreds of jobs and it's helping to drive the economy\nAnd it's a different perspective on it of trying to look at the robustness of the whole community and ways that we can have conversations about things like health care and look to different types of advantages\nOh absolutely you know it's like it's like when I talked to my friends who are like they're the climate climate change climate change I said you know you guys will approach is wrong you come at Republicans and you called them deniers or anybody who who doesn't agree with you because the reality is while scientists out there then you can find a posing science and the fact that some of the numbers have been\nYou know you know just dump a little bit people get frustrated and think it's a bunch of bologna if you come at it from a\nHey you know what whether you believe in this science that science reality is going to take better care of the planet plus there is some money to be made here so there's a capitalism is a part of it why not become part of a of a solution here we don't do that anymore we can't have a conversation the same thing goes with health care\nI Want to find a way to get I Would love to see everybody get healthcare can we can we use a combination of both what are the tradeoffs is Thomas Thomas ... say it's about trade off what trade offs can we have\nBecause at this point I look at the Republicans and Democrats they'd rather have a hundred percent of nothing than fifty percent of something\nLook you're preaching to the choir on this I mean especially with the environment I think the other thing that happens just to talk psychologically for a moment\nPeople have a an understandably defensive reaction when they are told that they that they are bad not bad\nHave a an understandably defensive reaction when they are told that they that they are bad not that it's their views but when you switch it over to that\nAnd there's an underlying sort of negativity and environmental messaging and here I'm not being party specific I'm just saying when we talk about the environment we tend to come from the sort of\nWe're so we'd an ideal that that man is bad and nature is all good and some people are like wait a minute if a beaver can build a dam like why can't we build apartment complexes like what does this thing that everything that man does is it bad and evil\nAnd and there's this under current to it that people understandably so you know some people have a defensive reaction to and I think there's a really positive way\nFor us to look at this and go look we put a man on the moon right we we obliterated polio from the face of the planet we got rid of the ozone hole and not a single business not a single business went out of business\nBecause we got rid of certain types of aerosols like this is something we know how to do we know how to be respectful of of the environment we knew how to not\nYou know regularly businesses to the point that they're choked off and die and we also know how to solve problems around the planet so let's actually talk about that\nInstead of just hurling recriminations at each other and telling people that man is bad and anyone who opposes this is is in denial there there's ways to have steps towards solutions and look I Will say with the with the intellectual dark Web overlap with Jordan a time he was my thesis adviser as an undergrad and we go back forever\nBut you know one of the things that we that around a little bit I mean I had a really helpful conversation with Ben Shapiro who I Would say is is is as opposed to me on most issues\nAh you know and and basically I was looking at a certain proposal and just called them up and was like hey what do you hate about this like tell me all the the issue that you have with us we had a super civil reasonable conversation I came out of it not having massively changed my mind on it but understanding the weaknesses\nAnd I made it tweaked to a policy proposal in keeping with some of the concerns that he raised so it's it's not like it's something where it caused me to go oh you know I I completely believe now like let's let's get rid of you know the smaller the government the batter the best form a government is when you can drown in a bath tub I mean it wasn't like it was some huge reversal\nBut we helpful is there was a libertarian\nSort of concern that was that I was aware of but that he really reinforced vehemently that helped me come back and make a couple of small adjustments to the things that I was proposing the respect that and I think we tend to undervalue\nIncremental change you know we tend to undervalue talking come up with solutions and one of the things I always say is there is a lot of really smart conservatives out there I'd love to have us all pretending not pretending I Would love to have us all actually working on solutions to make use of all these brains to say hey\nHere's what I think is really important for a baseline of health care in this country and for them to say here's all the problems with that and for us to say how do we solve that how do we get here\nYou know how do we get here without causing damage to small businesses and to really sit down and be able to utilize brains in a brainstorming away from all sides of the table that's really what the intellectual dark webs about\nAbsolutely talking to a greater which is of course the author of the orphan accident and many comic books are you guys might recognize that never was talking about him\nSaving the Democrats and just having corals real\nConversations and again it's the trade off I was joking with my friend last night I said if the Republicans and Democrats each won the lottery the other night because the other side would be getting some of it neither of them would want it and it did some game and the fact is it has to be trade off we can find a way both capitalistic ally\n... it to help health care and to get\nAnd it and it's this zero sum game and the fact is it has to be trade off\nWe can find a way both capitalistic ally in it to help healthcare ... due to to do things and maybe if there is some government intervention governments brought in some way shape or form\nThat we can figure out a way to protect children adults people who are vulnerable we can do that the problem is I ... both sides want it their way or no way and that\nTo me is ridiculous I'd rather have seven Seventy percent of something Greg than a hundred percent of nothing why is it ... that we've gotten to this point here is is it only big money and the donors that are out there\nOr is there other things that people are afraid of because this this six percent on either side the bully pulpit screaming you know social justice warrior lunatics\nHad been able to do in many ways hijack part of the party and a lot of I think politicians are afraid of\nYeah I think that that that's not inaccurate I mean I Would say that one of the other problems that we have that we don't always look at as ... as as clearly as this is I think social media plays a big part of it and I think whatever side of the equation that you're on\nHum what we've gotten is is a virtual arena where people spend more time socializing than in the real world and they can unlike anyone who disagrees with them and they're creating a bubble of people who largely um\nAgree with what they think hum and and basically what it becomes a sort of the virtues signaling Olympics right like the more vehemently you can be opposed to something that is racist the more vehemently you can only left asked\nThe more clicks you get the more benefit that you get the more followers that you get and it's reinforced constantly in a direction that propelling us opposite sides so one thing that's really important to me is I follow a ton of people across the spectrum there was a big issue in Hollywood here because somebody said that we should follow bench appear to see what he thinks\nAnd a bunch of people from the left kind of blew up over and it's like how would you not like how do you not want to tell the people who you disagree with\nA and know what they're up to and you know a lot of my friends really span the gamut I've a lot of friends who are conservative a lot of friends who were Wall Street Republicans I've some friends who are kind of you know\n... a Trump voters a lot of libertarians and when you do that what you start to get which is which is to advantage both strategically I think and morally\nAs you start getting ear for all the things that really turn people off like what are the buzz words that make people shut off and retreat into their their in group favoritism let's call us\nAnd we want to know how to avoid that and not just to make effective messaging and not just to win but we want to also understand that so we can figure how to talk to each

like him or not these are things that are because of of the potential of that reality is this is huge but it wasn't talked about because it's not\nSexy right drug addiction isn't sexy\nTo talk about but there I say this many of you listening have a family member or maybe you had issues with drugs or alcohol the amount of people that are dying because of opioids in this country is massive\nBecause there was no fighting there was no Pickering there was nothing to see here and we need to figure these kinds of things out these things that we need to talk about these are things where you would we focus on all of the other stuff that I'm not saying that the bombs and\nTalk about these things where you would we focus on all of the other stuff that I'm not saying that the bombs and at this thing is an important talks with absolutely talk about but I\nI I'm Talking about what about all the other things that are out there that the\nAverage person who is not somebody who's obsessed with politics who's not up somebody who sits around and watch his MSNBC of Fox and reach New York times and the national\n... hill all day what about everybody else was going about their life the way things are important\nAre shared war of fighting drug crime there's never been more important than now\nThat Jeff Sessions not ... that's just ... McGraw all the food but he's right about that we need to figure this out\nAnd I think it was great that they came together I think it was good that they did in some of the stuff in this bill is very interesting and one of the big things that you know it it's tradeoffs remember it's not going to get everybody\nBut some of the things that they're talking about is a way that something that I've been screaming about when it comes to opioid addiction\nIs how do we treat it from jumped meaning we need to find new ways to manage pain from the beginning\nBut because we live in a world of instantaneous in this we just want it hey you know at my my I had my teeth pulled and you know my my whatever it is back here was pulled my wisdom to the it's just easier to go here's thirty days of these\nIt also talks about you know some of the ways you're going to try to limit doctor shopping things of that nature and I think that's great but it was completely overlooked because\nWhat happened yesterday with the bombs or the potential bombs going out to people and I'll be honest with you take away even that it wouldn't have been talked about much because there's just nothing sexy about it's real but not sexy\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three actually had been some shows your Twitter tweet at us Megan Kelly gone the caravan on the way and the most misspelled words we got it all kids it's Jeb messages\n[noise]\nChad show [noise]\n\nNow would have been slipping on my Casper mattress I pick it over every mattress of ever had it helps me get the best night's sleep period what'd you try to Casper you're going to love yours to Casper is a high quality mattress at an affordable price I sleep cool and comfortable every night\nNew technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being spoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real there's\nAlways been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time but it used to require a prostitute and honey trapping effect business partner in a bribery scheme and the more\nThat well we still have those right but that just like somebody's going oh gee on those kinds of things like that super\nOh gee but the things they can do now are incredible and and and it is it is nuts and by the way it can be somebody sitting somewhere in a cave with a satellite link up\nAnd the opportunity connect to the Web and have all the tools in the world they need at their disposal to make something look real that's the thing\nNow we can use technology to surround somewhat and give them a fake experience fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real it don't make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad\nAt it the real reason we need to take that Russia type investigations so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team often I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and those U.S officials and the public at\nLarge yeah yeah but also here in America\nBecause for every one of those people that are trying to do something you've got ten people here in America that are doing the same thing\nFor their side I mean look\nThat are doing the same thing for their side\nI mean look at all the PACs all the dark money that's out there looking all the ads that you see day in and day out you're inundated with stuff and all this dark money paid for by that blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and that's for all intents and purposes that's just the ... it'll legalize version of trolling people\nWe have so many internal divisions\nAbout geography about race about gender about guns there's many many issues where Americans are so divided that we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL kneeling controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the first Seventy two hours after that flamed the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides\nThat and then I like that kind of football\nShould just be funny\nIt's crazy it really is and it's frustrating and that's always telling me like oh people I don't know how many I get probably Fifteen to twenty people who I Am me something they saw today right so here's some thing look at this what do you think of this\nAnd I'll say look at the source\nIf you're really serious about it if you really want information it's not ... the beauty of of all of these things these strictures and the technology is the other side of it is you can find out how real some of these things are\nI mean we talked yesterday about the whole George Soros thing I got sent so many of these this is George Soros at a Nazi uniforms like no it's not it's not even close to what\nPeople want to buy into it because a lot of times people don't care they just want affirmation to their belief\nSo it makes it easy to spread these things when nobody really cares if the stories true as long as it backs up their belief system and that scarier to me and a lot of ways\nWe're going to have a world where you're going to\nHave things like the Kavanaugh hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be having a party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right\nNow it's gonna be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today\nAnd and for all of that stuff though like I say\nIf you're serious about finding the truth that about something you can do that\nBut in the world that we live in for all of these technology advancements that are great that people use to do bad things or to try to divide us a good portion of people trying to divide us our own selves\nAnd the other side of it is we let them because we don't want to think anything other than the things that we want to think we want our affirmation not our information\nSo we will just go to that and say it has to be true I Want it to be true so if I go to look for it and I find out it's not true that is going against my own belief system I wouldn't want to go against my own belief system so part of it is our fault\nAgain enough responsibility to go around not personal responsibility\nNot blame to go round and enough hate to go around all of those things are unlimited in scope\nBut ... we have an abundance of we're growing them everywhere personal responsibility affirmation him for all of this stuff we can all go grab which which one do you want to put in your little shopping basket well take some personal\nResponsibility affirmation information all of this stuff we can all go grab which which one do you want to put in your little shopping basket well take some personal responsibility\nYou don't take some of that one percent yeah I'll take some blame too yeah but I also want some affirmation\nMm I'll take a little bit of information but not too much information I mean if something's really insane like George Soros is the vampire I won't buy it but George does being a Nazi maybe I'll take a little bit more information affirmation they're rather that kind of information because I Want to believe it\nThere's actually a national security exposures for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\nYeah and you know what I Want to say this year you know what else is the big issue\nGoogle huge issue\nGoogle's massive do you know that there's what two hundred fifty thousand engineers working at Google they dwarf China and Russia put together and the amount of engineering that's going on\nSome of the things that they want to do some of the things that they want to try some of the things that they're able to do with speech and the way that they go about doing it\nIs scary to it is very interesting\nBut yeah these are security issues that we need to be aware of but part of that I also look to the people and I say\nPart of this is your own personal responsibility just because somebody tells you something or shows you or me or you read it somewhere doesn't mean it's true if you are honest about trying to find into yourself\nAnd saying I I I'm honest about my belief system I Want to find out if this is true or not you'll do the footwork to find out it's\nTrue but\nOur personal responsibility for many of us out there it ends once we see something that that ... that we go oh well I I Believe that to be true so I'll take it at face value\nAnd part of that's on us\nAnd you wonder why the people worry about the nanny state well ... for a lot of people out there who've me wrong that you're not an idiot\n\nMany of you you guys get it you're willing to go the extra step there's a lot of people out there that aren't three two three five three eight twenty four twenty three at your best in show is your\nTwitter you can

Russian expert he was actually a tax possibly by a a potent cronies present I I ... anti puente stances\nHe he specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't it interesting I had\nIf you're that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to and designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think if we and so in some ways we shouldn't rollout of I mean I think it's a very ... very strange moments and and we have no idea where it comes from\n[noise] we have no idea where it comes from that's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign context was everything what that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy theory rising again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up at the episode started happening a couple of days ago\nLast week last week the United states announces\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I N F treaty signed by a a signed by um I'm President Reagan and negotiations are pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles\nIn Europe then the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat at the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used\nTo kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the\nGround in Syria the Russians are not happy about this and so\nTo me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale and it wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we know this\nSo it it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir Putin wants\n\nI think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail in any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilots\nWhen you are or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd ... former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five\nForty war that has a number of taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on Twitter I'm Andrew longer I Am sitting in for war in ...\n\n\nIt's your last week to get the Gen yourself sunspot correct or for free for sunspots aged bought that even read inflamed patches Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sunspot director she says it's her go to product every day she had sun spots and eight spots can definitely see a difference in her skin since using it\nTell mom in you know it's it's it's a situation in which we know that we're putting wants to do is foment as much to visit miss and chaos as possible in in American political circles this is what he wants to to do\nI mean given the fact that I Want to talk to you about your thoughts about America pulling out of the INS treaty 'cause you've written about this given the fact that we pulled out of the IMF treaty last week\nUm uh and and given the fact that there are Russian soldiers that are being killed on the ground in Syria isn't there even the barest possibility that this could be an FSB operation a given that the timing of all this or is the time and just to type for it to be that kind of an operation\nWell it is possible I mean what they just sprayed nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nFor you know the vice president's et cetera are of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the ... former Soviet Union and I I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it\nUm but potent has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that\nBut what you know that he's going to target these countries I can talk so what is it what does that mean and and how and what you what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by ... on the IMF treaty pullout\nWell that's exactly what you would think he would say well what else is going to do except threatening you know the U.S in countries where we may deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles\nJust like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with that person can choose against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so what do you mean by targeting is is really just putting the court and it's sort of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting a time out of that period of\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing darker coordinates\nOh for sure he he\nWhat could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before it and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can keep up with us economically especially under the Trump economy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThey tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations it's you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot a he's a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it will go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the ... show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explaining what's a little bit about what ... dot com is 'cause that's that's fascinating to me\nI Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy the language I learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street\nRussia studied it at the air force academy that language I learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI have built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also when the language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I've I'm always looking for people to talk to\nThe hottest show dog she was on a show so much but my my question a lot of sleep people what they don't understand is it is it this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about ... the trappings of the Russian Empire and and\nYou're exactly right until the end of things like me\nWell thank you but you got ... [laughter] I think it was possible showing a plane that a little bit explained to explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah they'll exist today as a monument and so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union\nWas one of the most productive successful countries they said do you\nReally have to world with their economy on their agriculture and adjust now a hundred years later I got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union pitch to them it destroyed them\nEconomically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet um you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this this changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion I mean the bombers or their their entire administration on down with the ones that clear to Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at a uranium ... you know those sales you look at a what's going on with the Trump dossier et cetera I mean there was an intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to be\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good work they're doing and I listen to how I get in touch with you want I Want to talk Russian when you\nUh well I don't you can always\nGo to our them dot com T.
