plan doesn't sound good\nIt it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college tutor a lecture\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to go into college tutor Lex two years old yeah\nWell ... maybe stuff for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and retirement five is kids college what you want or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to\nPay on your mortgage is yeah which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our Confederate that we should just save up a a but for three maybe four month emergency fund them then yep\nAnd then and then let them stop taking out student loans\nAnd clear him out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounded like a rental are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies okay\nOr immoral fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for\nWhat is the only one of the only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still alive and take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make the math work All right ah yeah still I'm just going to blink alone on those minimums\nAnd take care of college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other one's\nA little about first they were getting back in the oil and K. or not\nSo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund\nRight yeah emergency fund is maybe step three and then babysit forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there's money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages\n... is that so there's still a prioritization even though ... says that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skip it was very very I guess technically you're given five are skipping five of\nYeah yeah yeah and you and your skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you're around the ways in which you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good

Mayfield financial inundate protections\nTo worry free financial solution [noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nHave you ever been in a situation where you felt uneasy [noise]\nWhen you've placed yourself or been put in a situation that's high risk perhaps just before you jump out of an airplane\nOr dive into shark infested waters all things I can assure you I never do sorry just not my cup of tea and I realized that some of their loved the adrenalin rush that can come from things like that but for most of us we don't like that feeling we don't like to feel vulnerable or feel an easy about something\nThat how about financial risks where you might financially feel vulnerable again there's those that like these risks and the gambles maybe they bet on sporting events or at the casino and then there's those that leave everything up to Wall Street where some of the biggest financial risks can be\nAnd the scariest part is that a lot of the time if you have an investment portfolio you don't even know what's in it\nSo for retirement planning you want to have the right amount in your portfolio that has protected and safe\nAnd then the right amount that you can risk it's about balance\nWall Street would have you believe that they are the only place where you can find this balance\nThey threw out words like modern portfolio theory an asset diversification as ways to try to convince you that your portfolio is in fact balance the truth is that's not what having a safety first approach is all about\nTrue balance comes from having a part of your portfolio that isn't in any sort of Wall Street fund at all\nHere's the facts Wall Street is great at the risk game sure you can get big gains see huge returns when things are good but at what cost you've got to be willing to ride the ups and downs along the way\nThis is acceptable when you're still working and you're a ways off from retirement you're still buying and reinvest thing along the way it goes over time history does show us that it will come back it might take time but eventually it'll come back\nBut what if you're close to retirement perhaps are already retired well the stock market and Wall Street is not where you want to rely one hundred percent of your money on\nWall Street just isn't in the safety business they never have and never will be that's not what they do\nDid you know that so far in two thousand Eighteen and yes we are still on the tail end of a ten year bull market run the three biggest point drops in the history of the Dow Jones industrial average have all happened in two thousand and Eighteen\nVolatility is back in a big way so as you get older you probably start to look at risk getting a little bit different way than you did when you were younger risk is now no longer just a bunch of numbers\nOr what kind of volatility you can bear but it's also a risk of your livelihood or your future livelihood your lifestyle\nThe money you've saved in your four one K. or your IRA or in other savings accounts it's what you've been working on saving for your entire life you don't want that to go away or\nThey are in other savings accounts it's what you've been working on saving for your entire life\nYou don't want that to go away or have your four O. one K. turn into what they call sometimes a two oh one K. which happened right after two thousand one when the stock market crash and in two thousand eight after the stock market crashed\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial we don't advised to our clients to rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nAnd that's where our safe money programs here at Mayfield financial really shine we want a place a portion of your portfolio into safety and remove the downside risk completely for that part of your portfolio\nThe part that you need to protect and keep safe the part that you need to be there when you want it\nAnd then you can still have that part of your portfolio that you can afford to risk and for every person there is a different amount to having safety or in our safe money program and then the amount that you have at risk on Wall street\nWell for one a safe money portfolio cannot lose money to any stock market volatility that's right it can't lose money to the stock market\nSafe money also offers guaranteed growth options it has beneficiary transfer availability it can be held in an IRA or a ... or even just regular saving money\nAnd if you're over fifty nine and a half and plan on still working most four O. one K. is allow you to roll over your retirement money into a safe money IRA the key of having safe money is that financial security that it can bring to your retirement plan\nNow we don't normally like to compare safe money to stock market money or risk money because they're two separate things they're designed for two separate purposes and we're not trying to pit one against the other so to save money so offer growth absolutely yes it does\nWell safe money is no get rich quick schemes it does offer security and stability and growth which is exactly what you're looking for as you retire\nIf you're looking for more information on this safe money in what I'm Talking about today and you want to know more we make it easy for you we

Arizona\nNow yes don't get me wrong the stock market still is one of the most powerful tools available when it comes to growing your money there's absolutely no doubting that\nHowever that requires inability for you to ride out the ups and downs that come with it because Wall Street is one of the absolute worst places to keep your money when you need to protect it which is usually about five years before and anytime after you retire\nYou see Wall Street isn't in the safety business\nThey never were and they never will be when Wall Street rises and when it goes up that's what's called a bull market it's a stair step up at inches higher and higher and higher this current bull market is now officially the longest in us history\nIt's easy to get caught up in the excitement the games the trillion dollar market caps\nHowever just a bull markets climbed the stairs bear markets are when markets fall\nCaps however just a bull markets climbed the stairs bear markets are when markets fall well they jumped out the window\nHistory has shown that time and time again it's easy to see this from past markets the crash in eighty seven the dot com bubble bursting in the two thousand one and two thousand to the financial meltdown of two thousand eight\nThese crashes happen quickly it's that bear market jumping out the window\nAnd when that bear market does come again and it will come someday believe you me are you prepared to see all these recent gains possibly disappear this is why here at Mayfield financial safe money become so crucial to your financial security\nThe fact is and I've said this before on this radio program that if you're in your fifties and sixties right now you will most likely go through three to four more bear markets in your lifetime so don't let that threaten your financial security\nI had a client in my office just the other day\nAnd his retirement was just around the corner literally it was just weeks away\nAnd in his four oh one K. he had saved and contributed and kept adding to it and getting his employer match and everything that can come with a four one K. if you're lucky enough to have one\nAnd in the past this client of mine had seen their fair share of ups and downs but now they were ready to move that part of their portfolio to safety\nNot to take them out of the game but to provide that financial security they needed\nBecause in the plan that we came up with here at Mayfield financial was that even if this market kept going up that's okay with my client they're safe money portfolio still going to grow gonna keep going up\nBut the main goal in the main purpose was to protect that part of his portfolio and their money\nSo it would not lose anything if this market were to take a tumble\nThat is the key to having peace of mind to having a worry free financial plan that is key to that financial security that we all strive for here at Mayfield financial\nSo if all of your retirement is in Wall Street or a brokerage account [noise] are you properly plan and set up to have the absolute best plan going forward\nIf not and this safe money concept sounds interesting to you or you'd like to know more we'd love to help

can harness the power of the stock market with out the risk that the market can brain on an annual basis one markets rise these safe money plans also increase in value\nBut if markets fall you don't give up what you already gained in previous years but if the market does fall you don't get any gains in that year either so the worst that you could do is a zero last but he's erode gain\nSo let's say the stock market goes up another ten percent from here well that's great we welcome it here and they failed financial in a safe money plan designed for growth over that year you'd see about five percent gain\nOnce you earn it you keep it it's the famous saying here\nAnd retain that let's say in twenty twenty the stock market finally decides to take a turn for the other direction and markets

portfolio won't lose a dime and you didn't have to give back that gain you had in previous years so the worst you could do even if the market did take a tumble is a zero loss and zero gain\nThan let's say after that big dropping at big bear market the market starts to recover and the market shoots up thirty percent as we bounce off that bear market and have a nice recovery while you get about a Fifteen Percent gain in that year that's the power of zero losses you don't have to go up and down with the market\nYou can go up when the market goes up and you stay flat when the market goes

let 'em have it or maybe you just want to know if you will even be able to buy a loaf of bread most of us are right in that middle range we want to be able to continue our lifestyle to be comfortable and have the freedom and six\nMost of us are right in that middle range we want to be able to continue our lifestyle to be comfortable and have the freedom and security and knowing that are essential needs are met and we still have some left over for the niceties of life this is after all is what retirement is all about in his four\nNow do all investment advisors offered this unfortunately no this type of planning or the planning that looks to take care of your essential needs first it's often not addressed\nIn this Wall Street dominated financial world that we're in too many investment advisers and individuals try to seek sky high returns and run the odds it's all probability based it's about calculating risk\nAnd hoping that a worst than worst case scenario won't ever happen during your retirement\nTo me and for all of us here at Mayfield financial that simply doesn't work\nI don't like running probabilities when it comes to retirement\nI Want certainties I Want guarantees I Want a retirement plan that puts safety first and where risk isn't measured by what stocks and bonds you have in your portfolio but as measured by the risk of losing your comforts\nYour house your income\nThese types of risks are there real risks we want to consider when planning for retirement\nSo there are many questions to answer when it comes to knowing what to do with your retirement money in your savings and how to best position yourself for the long term so what is the answer\nWell it depends it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met and want to continue the lifestyle that we're comfortable with throughout retirement\nSo here at Mayfield financial we are a safety first retirement planning from we take a look at your retirement plan and identify how to secure your income needs we can help you identify your essential expenses and\nWe take a good look at your spending not to force you to change your lifestyle but to see how
