you should be afraid for your daughter's that's it you should be absolutely afraid of course he's taking the heat for saying this\nThe other problem is that for the people who are real victims of these things when it is so obviously political in cases like this it really diminishes the real claims\nI think is very true but you just read the room every once in a while you got to just read the room that I think I think that's a lost art\nI think that is very much a lost art thing where you could look around and you gotta like okay I can read the room here what are their or something like comics will understand that\nComics will get that they'll read a room and go you know and I can do a little bit of this year I Know a little bit further here you know bans I think we'll we'll get the same thing to get a feeling from the crowd and and I think sometimes for politicians they're always trying to read the room and they're always trying to be on their best\nSometimes it just doesn't work out that way and then the ... thing you gotta watch you're going to take a hammer for it\nSince they're always trying to read the room and they're always trying to be on their best sometimes it just doesn't work out that way and then the me too thing you've got to watch your going to take a hammer for a look and I worry too I've said it over and over again I'm raising an eight year old son who is my world but quite frankly I Do worry\nAbout him in this day and age of all you know it just takes one accusation or takes one of this or you did a little bit of do this and you know and it in a day and age where you had kids at school right like I get a cold a couple of years ago\nBecause two little girls were chasing him and they tried to kiss him when he was like in first grade and they're like what do you want us to do about this like he wasn't in trouble like I'm like what are you talking about getting a room I don't know\nI mean that's stupid they're being kids but that's the weirdness right you put your finger at a kid when you're when you're if you're a kid oh what was your finger loaded how dare you and then you've got to go to sensitivity training and all this stuff like that I mean that's just the insanity of and all\nThat is just the absolute insanity of of this I sit back and I sit here and go wow\nBut you do have to read the ... you have to learn how to read the room three two three five three twenty four twenty three at your best and shows your Twitter you could tweet at us still a lot of your are are are are texting and tweeting about ... and you know people say you're in the middle you're independent what do you think about it look I think that both of them\nGave powerful powerful statements ah I Do believe something happened to or do I believe it was him now I think it should let it play itself out I got zero problem with that I Know a lot of people that we should just voted Mitt already doesn't work that way how many times I just plain to people\nThe way it works right the way it works is you need these votes flake Collins because if you don't have that we can vote you don't get to take their votes wages vote for the sake of it they may vote no and then he's dead and the water and then what\nWell how do we make them vote well they want this and you're going to get this and I don't know if there's going to be any anything that comes out at the end of this I don't think there is I I think in the end that that that\nWhat we have now is kind of what we have which is you're going to have to figure out for yourself\nAnd will they get a little bit more time I don't know but also remember that this isn't one of those things where the FBI is going to come out and say oh you're guilty\nThis is not a criminal investigation same way that the proceeding without a criminal proceeding and that means that they can subpoena witnesses they can't force people to answer their questions they're not necessarily going to draw conclusions\nYeah then ... out there who were just absolutely love was alive he uh he's right so it's not like you're going to we're not going to get anything super Rachel Mitchell who was the woman that was asking questions she put out her little thing and it basically said\nLook there's no prosecutor in the world that would carry for a case like this you're going on flimsy\nEvidence at best he said she said she said he said you you\nYou you couldn't draw any kind of real conclusion that this person was guilty of whatever that she was alleging that took place that day and that ... that he was the one that perpetrated it so nobody would move forward in a situation like this but that doesn't matter and again it's not about\nCabinet or it could have been any but you could look Mickey

adventure and show [noise]\n\nWhen it comes to job hiring their job sites that send you tons of wrong resumes to sort through that's not smart you know what else is not smart using your relatives to fill in at work while you're looking for staff\nWhen it comes to life you know it's not smart making the lottery the centerpiece of your retirement plan\nThey are prepared for it in a way and then you have other folks who are often times great decent hardworking people but they find that they're being incorporated into a marginalized minority they're living in segregated communities\nThey feel locked out of the middle class and you might decide as an individual hey I'm the one who moved okay fair enough not a big deal you know I decided to do it myself but then for that person is child\nIt's a very different story when you were raised in that environment where you're assimilating into this kind of underclass group\nThat becomes a really tough and that's what we're ignoring right now we're ignoring the fact that we're not just talking about one single thing called immigration we're talking about different experiences depending on skills language ability and much else\nTalking to ... a melting pot or civil wars new book consent of immigrant makes the case against open borders\nSo we look at like I look at immigration I think we've got to start thinking outside the box I Would love to see us do something kind of European based in the sense of\nIf you're a part of NAFTA or whatever this new thing is maybe there's a ... a lot freer and easy to move in and out of countries where you can come here and we know you're here essentially for lack of better term as a boutique all you want to make the money and leave\nRather than this fake thing that we're trying to do now which I just don't think is working around I just think we're failing miserably at it and neither side really wants to do anything about the immigration and a real way\nI respectfully disagree with you there I see where you're coming from and I do think that there are some ways\nI'm you know to address the system and more sensible ways my concern is having this kind of guest worker migration and freeing up creates other problems down the road because let's say you're here as a temporary guest worker for three years five years what happens is you form routes you form relationships you start a family\nRight and then you say okay now we're going to enforce the rules at this point down the line I don't think that's really going to work in a society that value civil liberties Singapore has a guest worker system that works decently well but Singapore is willing to deport\nGuest workers who become pregnant\nAnd that's something that I really don't think Americans have the stomach for and that's why I think allowing that kind of temporary immigration you have to be really careful about it you have to be willing to really enforce it on the back end so I see\nYour point and I do think that you know for example you could make it easier for retirees states live in Mexico you can make it easier for professionals are\nEarning a certain income to make that kind of movement but I think that moving too far in that direction could have downsides\nSee what you're saying it's like everything else there with Governor right is it the idea may be good and you might make this amazing you know you come up this incredible idea but the reality is is when we go to put it in ... we never followed through with the way that things are and then it becomes more about feelings and facts and that's where we run into real issues\nI Would go even further than you Chad there are a lot of times when people make an argument for a certain policy without ever intending to follow through\nIn a way it's almost like a fake policy or going to say this is going to be a temporary policy but we're not doing any of the things we need to do in order to actually make a temporary I see that a lot in policy debates and I frankly think it's pretty dishonest and misleading\nRobots government isn't this politics right oh you do something wrong to to get elected and really nobody cares outside of that 'cause nobody ever hold your you accountable for your actions so let's\nOh you do something wrong to get to get elected and really nobody cares outside of that 'cause nobody ever hold your you accountable for your actions so let's talk about the ... you're talking about the immigrants we we need in America\nWhich and and there is there is a need for for people not just gas workers you know people are going to pick our fruits and vegetables and whatnot\nBut there's a lot of other skills coding and things like that we're we're falling behind and we need those people here how do we go about doing that in a way that is you know you know I I was a guest worker thing out there but how do we bring people here on merit you know like a meritocracy if you\nWill it really is true that you have people who are educated in the United states or who have a job offers who could absolutely support themselves and they often find it very very hard to get a green card\nPartly because there are so few green cards available to people on unemployment basis we give out green cards the vast majority of them to people\nBased on whether or not they're related to someone or whether or not you're the adult sibling\nA someone who was already residing in the country and much else and my own view is that that doesn't make a ton of sense you know maybe you can say okay that that could be a point in your favor but that shouldn't be the only thing we consider we should also take into account\nWhether or not you have the language skills whether or not you have a job offer that pays you well enough\nTo ensure that you're not going to rely on the safety net I think that would make a lot more sense and by the way it would actually be more predictable and rational people who find her system totally crazy and maddening would really appreciate that too it would be better for Americans it would be better for people who are trying to see hey\nWhat are my guide post what's being expected\nOf me if I Want to live in the United states\nWhat is what was your was your life like I mean you grow up you report New York so what is your life like you you're obviously son of immigrants so they they they come here what was their assimilation like what was yours simulation like it in in into the culture of America\n[laughter] well in my case I was very lucky partly because I was part of a really small group part of a really small community so when I went to school the vast majority of my friends they came from different backgrounds they came from all over the place and we spoke English to one another and we just grew up in American culture\nAt almost by necessity but then when you have folks who are growing up in isolated segregated\nEnclave community as it can be a really different story you find yourself almost trapped in this community and you find yourself alienated and separated from Americans from other backgrounds you know that's an extreme case but it really does happen and some corners of the country and my fear is that that might\nBe even more the case in the future if we don't adopt more controlled and managed system\nWhen I look at everything ah my big fear is inevitably you know ... over you this that and the other people scream stuff because that's all they know how to do is that America we we have a culture in America and for whatever reason the people on the left in particular\nAre afraid of our culture because they only look at the ... of our culture and not the good and I always say that you go around the globe people love American people that come here and I grew up in a time in an era where kids in my school when I was a junior high and escape Cambodia and the ...\nAnd they embrace the culture they loved America they believed in the American dream if more than most Americans\nAnd yet we can't talk about that in this day and age because the minute you bring something up like that it's a ... if you're trying to kill other people's soldier the American flag makes people uncomfortable it's insane how do we get around that\nIt's really tough because basically right now when people at advanced those messages are this idea that the melting pot of some terrible thing you get rewarded for it you know these are ideas that you know members of the elite had them\nUh this idea that the melting pot of some terrible thing you get rewarded for it you know these are ideas that you know members of the elite had embraced and that's something that I personally find pretty scary because if you don't have a melting pot story if you don't have a unifying story about all that Americans\nDo have in common that's where you get this incredible divisiveness and what your pet one group against another so I agree with you I think that's a\nBig concern and I think that that's why I Want an immigration system that is more sensible rational and balanced because that is what allows immigrants to really become a full part of American culture\nIf if you were to have one thing you could do and immigration just once they get they come to you and they said around you have one thing that we're gonna we're going to allow you to put this in here what would that one thing be\nI think we should adopt a points system in which we select immigrants based on their actual qualities what it is they're bringing to the table rather than purely basing it on family\nTies I think that would be a huge huge improvement over the status quo and I think people would feel a lot better\nAbout immigration if they knew that folks are are taking into account uh the contribution people are making and whether the immigration system is actually in the national interest and in the interest of all American workers\nLast question coming on today a and this will will will just quickly go off topic what do you make of the craziness when it comes to the whole Kavanaugh and everything going on right now\nWell I'll just say that Brett Kavanaugh is a guy who has always been in liberal institutions he's had friendships with liberals he was literally hired as a lecturer at Harvard law school by Elena Kagan was appointed the Supreme Court by President Obama he someone who is always played by the rules are always tried to make friendships and it's really striking to see\nHow much opposition there was to him long before any of these abuse allegations came to light we're just in we're through the looking glass were in this frightening leap partisan environment and uh and I just don't know where we go from here\nNo me either me either melting pot or civil war son of immigrants makes the case against open borders a round salaam hope to have you on again appreciate your coming on today great book for anybody out there who really wants to understand things thank you so much and I look forward to talking\nTo you again thanks for having me ... thank you\nThat you had mentioned shows your Twitter ca J. D. P. E. N. S. so and his book is very interesting and the assimilation part I I I don't know how many times I have to tell people this to me that's the most important part when you become a somebody who comes here the reason they're coming here is because America is America\nNot because you get to be you just in a different place and I think the people who embrace stuff like that and understand the greatness of what we have to offer there's a reason they want to come here they see something different than most of us I think a lot of us we've lost the site we can't see that the\nOur predicted it it's just like our predicted there was a storm [laughter]\nAffair that would be a storm and then there was Superstorm Sandy blocker profit a prophet of do Mr [laughter]\nRan cars in London there was an attack using a car with armed\nNo more cars and then\nAs you complain way street cred\nPlant Kelly ...

Kavanaugh I think it's actually listening not a bad thing I think it's a good thing\nNow with that being said I'd like it to go quickly\nQuickly well we'll see if it's going to go quickly or not very interesting\nUh this whole investigation and ... you know it's funny as you're hearing all of this even got the right in the left fighting or already over fighting over the investigation how we should go when will it end where what can they do what can't they do Dick Blumenthal\nWhite House seems to be micromanaging and scrapes happening and investigation that must uncover the facts and evidence necessary to determine whether I have it all is qualified to sit on the highest court in why no that's not what they do\nThey're investigating a situation you guys are supposed to find out to be qualified to do the job he could be a wonderful human being with nothing hanging over him and not qualified to sit on the highest court and the land that's your job\nOr they straight jak inning micromanaging it potentially but they're looking at a situation especially the president where he's going okay look at the ... where we started and where we are\nTwo different things it was all about collusion the Russians and all of this stuff nobody and that's the thing that he's still angry about when it comes to this entire investigation when it comes to him\nIs the fact that\nThere isn't any restrict there wasn't any parameters put on there was an Elaine was told to stay in so it gave Mahler free room room to run so what he's trying to say is look we need to put it in a situation where look you can investigate\nA B and C and that's it right that is it a B and C\nDon't want you out they're investigating what what I Do as a you know\nThat's it right that is it a B and C\nWe don't want you out they're investigating what they do is ah you know even though there wasn't rape here maybe had too much to drink here or maybe he you know he got into it in a fist fight with a friend and I mean ... that's the insanity of where they're worried about going and I completely understand that\nAnd I think that you know there should be parameters on all these investigations because if they're just going to investigate it investigates they they can be there forever and a day and\nWhat they could eventually catch him on or whatever they're trying to do it could have nothing to do with anything and that's what the left is hoping for\nSo yes in the end it's about giving him parameters it's about putting in a situation and even flake right even Jeff Flake who everybody hates right now and I'm going to tell you about Jeff like there's a lot of you out there you can't stand Jeff Flake I got a lot of of you know how horrible is he's a rhino I'm telling you this now\nThere is more than meets the eyes that people will find out later on down the line about why he did what he did\nAnd yet all the smartest political folks I have it I was going to be approved and the Democrats know it they're just doing this for show as though with all of the crazy left these who had been nominated as democratic candidates that some of the Democratic party comes out ahead gifts they can behave in the craziest way during these here and\nI don't think it's going to work for them but hey\nLet them do as much as they want I think it works best for us\nSo Lars Larson show seven to ten on one for one taking the eight two sons news and talk [noise]\nFocus on the White House as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues to deny decades old allegations of sexual improprieties President Trump went to West Virginia over the weekend delivering the same message to a friendly audience ABC cerebellum area with the story\nPresident Trump's slamming Democrats taking a defensive judge Kavanaugh on the road to a rally in West Virginia\nThe entire nation has witness these shameless conduct of the Democratic party they returned image injuries and obstruct and destroyed and you see that over the last four days\nDemocrats on the attack as well now questioning judge Kavanaugh temperament after Thursday testimony where he shows flashes of anger FBI\nAgents interviewed Kevin accuser Deborah Ramirez a source telling ABC News accuser number two provided a list of witnesses to her alleged encounter with Kevin ... who denies all allegations Richard camp to ABC News\nFor what it's worth on the shelf rant and remember that tweet from Tesla founder Ilan months' back in August claiming he had secured funding to take the company private at four hundred and twenty dollars per share well above then was must may be in trouble for posting that\nFast forward to now the securities and Exchange Commission filing a complaint they must have claimed was fault the FCC Stephanie ... says that adds up to misleading investors for electric car company\nHad not secure funding for the proposed transaction to the contrary we allege that he had not even discuss key deal terms including price with any potential source of funding\nIn addition to civil penalties and repaying any ill gotten gained the FCC wants mosque to step down\nAt a bar for hitting not for serving as an officer or director of the public company in the future\nMosques firing back responding to the complaint thing integrity is the most important value in his life and denied any wrongdoing for what it's worth I'm Michelle ...\n\n\nThis isn't about why why you All right [noise]\nOne year later after all those shots were fired and still why Stevens\nAddict carried out the attack is a mystery Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo has a theory to panic was angry about losing money to gambling and had mental issues\nWithout a manifesto or even or note to answer questions the totality of the information that has been gathered leaves us to only make an educated guess as to the motives of Stephen parents\nAll local police of closer investigation the FBI's behavioral analysis unity still working on a psychological report on panic due out later this\nYear you think about it were a year is actually one year today the anniversary of that horrific day and we as human beings\nWe want to know for ourselves right\nToday the anniversary of that horrific day and we as human beings\nWe want to do for ourselves right like could could we be the monster could we be that guy seemed to have everything\nYou had money he he seemed to have everything what happened what was the trigger and this was the weirdest of all the weird we see a lot of these things where you know he was bullied or or you know he lost his job and he was angry at the world or whatever you know\nThis was none of that this was none of that so not putting a any kind of of of you know just your thumb right on it and think just to sit here and found I found it it it's freaks people out it does because inherently\nWe want to solve a problem and that problem is is is what was this how did this happen you know ... how did this happen how how how did we get here what what happened to this guy that made because he had all these things\nAnd you know it has been a year and it is it is crazy it is absolutely crazy even Trump spoke about it today\nAll of America is grieving for the lives lost and for the families they left behind so to all of those families and to the people of Las Vegas we love you we are with you\nYeah as we should be as we should today I think Vegas is going to go dark\nA today which will be very interesting to see how that plays itself out they're going to go completely dark and and you know we've seen since the Parkland and we've seen a few other ones since then and a horrible acts but nothing comes anywhere close to that\nAnd still the question remains why\nAnd this is one of those ones where it's going to be a mystery because there was as I said no manifesto nothing nothing that can definitively point we're just guessing at this point in time and human beings we hate that\nWe hate guessing because this has to do with somebody who seemed to have it all and that makes us uncomfortable three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had been to the show is your Twitter show this weekend a day with the old certainly alive\n[laughter] I'm at a loss for words here I\nWent and dressing up like a bottle of ... water last night on SNL he was performing\nHis first of three songs with rapper little mom who\nWas also dress up as a water bottle guy on the weekends were apparently a reference a line of song talking about sparkling Stillwater audiences seemed pretty confused Twitter was ruthless one person's weeding out at this point I wouldn't be surprised economy dressed up and tell us helping\nYeah yeah it was interesting right but then the thing that got everybody's in a\nYou know if you will ... is the fact that he talks about Trump\nAnd in the day and age especially in a place like New York city or San Francisco or Los Angeles or Seattle there are places you can talk about Trump and then there are places you're not allowed to talk about Trump without fearing the rats\nWhat we did in the west that apparently he stayed on\nDuring a commercial break David ... causing some in the audience [noise] this is only\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa\n[laughter] you know a lot of talk about that how dare you how dare you\nYou know a lot of talk about that how dare you how dare you have an open mind up there you say anything else\nYou do something like that and it was a it was you know the usual satellite stuff\nThey definitely want after Kavanaugh Matt Damon play cabin up\n[noise] good how are you ready to be again oh hell yeah I'm going to start an eleven [laughter] I can do about the real\n[laughter] first of all I show does reach the almost no one [noise] my family not my friend's not even ... or ... we are on my last night was screaming into an empty bag of Doritos [laughter]\nIt was okay I guess it was All right you know uh it is a ... and it continued and\nI can I can laugh at stuff like this I Know a lot of people out there get angry about it I I just first of all rarely find any of it in eastern ... does funny anymore but this was an awful I mean you're not because of a sham\nCon job orchestrated by the Clinton or oh Pat Pat Griffin [laughter] running for not draw [laughter] usually an optimist [laughter]\n... kind of guy [laughter] laugh a little bit\nKids cry three two three five three ... three ... and Joe is your litter you can tweet at us lot of stuff to\nDo so will she er well gee that is a big question midterms are coming up this could be this was a big referendum on Trump this the first time that really Trump is on the ballot\nAnd it's going to be interesting to see how that plays itself out not only ... you know just in in ... I think you're going forward even twenty twenty she said she made me think about it we'll talk about that as well three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter you can tweet at us\nLove you and make sure you check out Chad Benson show T. V. on the old YouTube is jet messages [noise]\n\nSuch adventure and show [noise]\n\nAre you fifth year older okay well I'm not going to ask\nYou to raise your hand so don't worry but I Do want to ask\nYou have you sign up for a Mac yet if your answer is no why it's a free membership for one year you don't even have to give them credit card information and just for signing up here some of the stuff you're gonna recede just some forty percent off movie tickets access the supplemental dental plans up the sixty percent off\nEven though his approval rating and those are always skewed because you may not like the person and a lot of that stuff is is is how we feel about the person themselves how do I feel about you I may not like you but I look around us him on the economy is doing okay and you know I don't I don't like him\nI don't like I I don't approve of him\nNow the job he's doing we may step back and that's a different story\nBut there are specific problems the strong for Republicans first some for the Republican incumbents are leaving while only Eighteen Democrats have announced their retirement and it's just easier to flip an open seat second twenty five House Republicans aren't districts carried by Hillary Clinton two years ago\nMainly in suburban districts literally from coast to coast only Thirteen democratic seats are in Trump friendly district and it is here in suburban America where the president's approval ratings are particularly low\nThere are some places he needs to worry about and and in the big chance you look\nI think I think the Dems have a real good chance of taking back the house the Senate still is going to be a nightmare for them it's going to be a real issue for them and you know this Kavanaugh that's one thing it'd be more talking about like this whole cabinet thing does that play into a lot of this\nIt's in the red states where the Kavanaugh nomination may play out particularly are influential ally remember only senators not congressman not house members vote on confirmation feeling was that these red state Democrats might be pushed to vote for confirming having all the recent allegations\nOf may make that differently also in these states centrist Democrats are going to be pushed by their Republican opponents on immigration and on whether they embrace the policies of the more progressive left wing of the national Democratic Party and\nRepublican opponents on immigration and on whether they embrace the policies of the more progressive left wing of the national Democratic Party\nAnd that right there's a big big deal because they're looking at this because you know I I saw over the weekend uh what's his name uh Bannon\nWho was on with the bill Maher oh by the way it was very it was very it was very interesting to watch because you know Bill Maher said first and foremost this is why the Republicans win 'cause they'll come on my show\nI don't have a problem getting people the left will go anywhere but he talked about the the the progressive populism that is coming and I think that's a big thing that people are looking at is is they're going to be a progressive wave of populism\nThat that I feel is is is actually starting to to happen you've got the populace and the Trump is brought and then you look over and you've been and they're they're lining up and this lady is the one I think who a lot of people think is going to take charge a come two thousand twenty\nTimes [laughter]\nFor women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that in a woman at\nThe top [laughter]\nAfter November's there I Will take a hard look\nAt running for president [laughter] [noise]\nThat's interesting and I think the reason she says after November sixth because if for the sake of argument\nRight\nThey don't get the house back and they don't get the Senate\nThan the thought processes I may not have a chance at all 'cause I've got to start running now I\nHave to start running now and if they if the ... if they think they've got everything in the bag they think they've got everything one they think\nHey this is it this is what people want they want our progressive politics they want this and all of a sudden it rolls around and you know if people are like yeah you know the independence cause that independents are going to decide to write the bases are the bases but the independents are going to decide this and they say you know\nWe don't think so then\nShe'll say I'm not going to run she wants to know that that that that movement is happening\nShe wants to feel the same thing I think that Trump felt that that movement is starting to come but here it is and we've got the progressive populist we've got the cost of your court as we've got the the people that are going left of the left of the left\nWe've got their behind us and that this is what America wants now we want a wholesale change we want a a you know health care for all we want guaranteed jobs when all of this stuff\nAnd then they can sell it to the entire country\nIf she feels she can do what you will but she's not going to do it if they get their asses handed to him\nIn November\nAnd that it's the prize or she's not going to do it because she knows if that doesn't happen then there's no chance\nZero ... not three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned Joe is your Twitter you can tweet us love hearing from you uh [noise] people are texting in about Kavanaugh somebody checked in and said she had a I never had\nA drink and I lived in a ... Christian life and and I didn't have a drink until I was Twenty one it's not hard to find no I think for a lot of people that I mean a majority of kids right\nHave had a few beverages what I was saying and that having a few beverages as a child in my child I mean you know Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen just should not disqualify you from this\nAnd that having a few beverages as a child and my child I mean you know Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen to should not disqualify you\nFrom this which is what they've started to make this now is that he's some sort of alcoholic and that's and that somehow we still must be that that that that this is the issue with that it's not just that he potentially did all these things Dr Palese forward and all of these other people that he is also\nA an addict and an end or an alcoholic which I find to be ridiculous\nAnd but but that's the way these things that go that's why when they talk about what's happening when it comes to the ... the scope of which this investigation could go on they want to narrow it keep it like hey you're here to investigate this All right\nYou're not here to investigative him and his friends you know party one night after a football game and they were just hanging out and they drank a keg right ... you're not here to investigate you here to investigate\nData he or didn't he do the things that he's been accused of by these women\nNot did he have too much to drink as an underage drinking and we're going to hold him somehow accountable as if\nOh but look at the things you wrote in the it's funny the other thing is to like somebody wrote earlier that look at things you wrote in the book we act as if young young men having said stupid things and been bragging doses when there are kids\nThat somehow we have the whole all everybody to the standard those ridiculous\nCome on now I live in a world of reality if that's the way we're going to be that we're going to hold these people up as we need somebody who was pious than his untouchable from ever having any kind of issues and you know come on like your ... some possible right it it's virtually impossible to find anybody\nThat does that pie is that is that and and and and if you\nDo find them kids only wanting part of any of the stuff that you're offered it's ridiculous it really is I I I just I sit here and scratching my head yes we want you to be a robot all the way through and that's the other thing like I look to Ted Cruz\nRight I looked at Ted Cruz and I felt like everything had did from the time he was a child to where he was when he was running for president was so manufactured that it felt uncomfortable\nBut they want you to be that way and then when you are that way it feels disingenuous and then it it's just it's a ... it's a never win situation three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... Joe's your Twitter a Mac\nIncredible somebody wrote me over the weekend said hey I just signed up it really was free I said it is free if you're over the age of fifty it's free a year membership free they didn't want your credit card they were shocked by that\nThey're like I was looking at them you're right I mean a lot of what I Believe they believe\nCommonsense immigration reform things of that nature Medicare reform things those natures that matter and on top of that the benefits were amazed and they're like you know you get all this stuff I said yeah been rigid about forty percent of the world lego land Six Flags Disneyland Disney World for himself movie tickets accept\nThe supplemental dental plans of the sixty percent off retail restaurant travel discounts check check check check and that's just to name a few there are so many things that you get and then some so what are you waiting for signed up today that he wants a credit card absolutely free one year membership and go to a Mac that us forward slash chat\nNo tricks know credit card required nothing there's no bait and switch it's free you just sign up boom A.

categorically in unequivocal\n[noise] kind of flash back in\nThe music [noise] on the B. fifty twos minutes later but this is just such an eighties\nDown to it doesn't it maybe it's music but this is\nWas carefree and I must say I I guess I went to a really boring high school we didn't have any other or we didn't have any of this no red so look right now go home now you know ... ...\n... that were written\nThe high school now I didn't run to the crowd\nMy that was my deal [noise] but that was\nReally sweating it who gave an interview with Kate Snow [noise] at NBC and Raymond ... was with us here in the learning from show with a lot of great guess are coming up\nUm but [noise]\nThere was a discrepancy because remember early reports were that Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge worse were drug ing and getting girls a drunk by spiking the punch bowl I didn't I didn't even know people still had\nPunch punch containers ... we just had a garbage cans with a hefty bag liners ... they were they were literally garbage cans with with hefty bag Weiner's when they had something called green machines which I had just a few too many of them every now and I'm a ...\nSo she she she was made this big story early on that it was Brett Kavanaugh was running around getting girl drunk so we can get the right training going right and then when she was questioned by Kate Snow there was a solo coping\nIndustries shifting the story is no longer she saw him engaged in this but but he was present at places where some kind of soul tapping the story is moving NBC was all over the place last night\nI'm just some background at just ... and ... as to her litigious nature okay now he was with her from Ninety four to two thousand one okay and and I asked him about this restraining order that he filed against her and why he didn't\nActually follow through on it and this is what where it went\nClaim Richard that ms sweat neck threatened you after you broke up with her ... what types of threats or you alleging\nRight after I broke up her she basically called me many times I saw a one point she basically said you will never ever see your own born ... child alive\nBonds or I Want to you know I'm just going to go over there where they can you guys she said she was going to kill you yes on ... ended up with\nOh scared him a little bit he's a noun an American citizen or he was originally I think from Ecuador when she when when they were together and whatever have now as an American citizen but it wasn't just that there was more or less\nListen like there's more from him\nTwice [laughter] she will get the right in my face I sue sue us so we asked me to hear\nRichard hold on she asked you to ... she was like hit me\nYet and yes and that was a that I don't know that wasn't before any miner or issues that we had ... was getting to my face on the first time I experienced that it was like oh my God this is just you know this is incredible so we'll get away my place to see what was the hit me\nHit the original hit me and this was something like remember what happened to my ex boyfriend\nWell I guess there was a report that her ex boyfriend had been jailed for hitting her or she claimed he hit her I I mean it's hard it seems like a big messed up situation I mean I'm not [noise]\nIt's hard again and the aftermath of a big blow up it's hard to tell what the truth is here\nWell the the the telling details of intimidation\nThe um ... violence threats of violence\nAll of that fills in a picture and that's all you can do in these investigations you don't you're not going to ever know the full story here but you're getting like a mosaic bits and pieces of a personality and that speaks to as you raised last night credibility credibility\nIn in the case of last night it was Mrs Ford tonight\nMs ... credibility well now what we know well now that Susan Collins thinks we should apparently look into that and Murkowski and flight they all want to

after from the beginning you have to start with the ... with the\nThe position was NAFTA in this current state good or bad well we have large deficits\nEvery everyone would agree it was it was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats when this thing went into effect and people would suggest don't upgraded as crazy and then in addition to changes in the economy we had very large deficits\nAnd we were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parts and companies [noise] ah to Mexico on to other places so the people who say we shouldn't have have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just that you know engaging in self deception I might\nI might know that both the secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nProblem is they would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned done so [noise] what the president did which I which I think was terrific is we have\nWe have by far the biggest trade bloc in in history at one point two trillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are that are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who had to pay my bills and do I care about\nAnd better in a whole variety of ways it's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to America and stays in America they there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make sure we review this on a periodic basis\nWe call it a review provision their labor rights which should never been like this ever in an agreement before there's\nAccess on agriculture there is there's a hole and then you move into the next step of things like digital trade middle actual property protection in financial services all these these ah twenty first century economy kinds of things there were no adequate

you think China Ken subsidize so there's there's a whole variety of things in various pockets of the extremely important agreement\nBetter than than anything in the states as Evan negotiate it before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys left to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working

with countries around the world so it's really really an important day\nWe're talking about Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators in getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement I bought one of the things that were wondering is how this works in a still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing where there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\n[noise] well I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly that there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that uh\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats a little ... in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that are thinking doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think uh the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticisms you have which is sort of an odd one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should've talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should\nUh take over and of course the exact opposite is true\nWe we we designed this to be bipartisan for working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being\nPurely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be passed with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she added that I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm John Harwood um CNBC said specifically regarding autos let's listen\nThere are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work\nIt means our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they won't be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new\nDawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your call I guess\nMy I mean if I had to make one word it would be nonsense [noise] uh you wonder about people who make statements like that there there are so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all the ... the major auto companies\nGeneral Motors Ford SCA was used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all said it's going to move more jobs back to America but that's not a bad thing yeah that's a good day they've all set\nBall endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take him to sit down and boosting their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just reading something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they don't know what they're talking about this was going to be really very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to the biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content\nOf cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest stuff\nWe're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent how was that a bad thing under under the ... the person who is going to lose out on this is China and places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in American duty free it's completely lunacy\nThe people don't live with her talking about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America\nNow it could be Canada also but in America for the most part that's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those cars should be made in America by American labor\nNow I think what President Trump prominence on his on the campaign trail he promised he delivered Bible Lighthizer us TR what's next I mean are you guys going to get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland or some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they've and Swiss they're anxious to do a deal with the guys I Know that first hand\n[noise] yeah and that we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise]\nWe have a lot of things that we're doing a small deal dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about we're talking I won't go through but there's a bunch of other countries do it and then of course the big the big elephant in the room just China\nAnd one of the funny things I'll tell you there's one last time on the\nWall Street journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things to sort of say oh look at this was bad for the S. and P. what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced history has thrill one which was like in March since the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like\nOne of one of these things where you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire to prove the opposite it and then the other ones that you should look at it I I ask any of your your list or to look at the thing if they happen to have the hopefully\nI'm looking I'm actually looking at it now and January twenty second march eighth but July and August when he's yeah\nYeah I just look at the ports put at the bottom just show where the where the that the China actions are the markets like straight up from their right I mean this whole area is right
