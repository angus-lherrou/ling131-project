and I think you know this is\nThe more that you get into the political world you know you're working with the America First action you're you're you're out there and and you're seeing things and you're talking to politicians I'm sure talking politicians on both sides despite what people like the the thing is\nThat neither side has you have to have the stomach to take something some of these these real issues on political yet that the political fortitude the stomach to take these things on and a lot of them they're just they're afraid because they think their jobs are on the line which may be true but the whole point is you're supposed to be they're serving the people not just your job in the party\nIn what I think needs to happen is and that's after November because we have to win in November the GOP has to maintain control both chambers of Congress\nAnd then we can um you know hold their feet to the fire after that because they've had two years the GOP Congress\nThey squandered two years to finally fix this thing they had the numbers they didn't need democratic support although they probably did because you've got some we meet a GOP members on on immigration but it's going to take leadership and I think the leadership\nCould start in the White House but I think the four pillars that the president proposed a new state of the union address was a great start the Congress didn't act on it but he has some leverage to there's certain things that the Congress once we have some spending bills coming up I think one comes up\nAfter 'em or the November election and the president a previously has threatened to veto that and shut the government down because there's no wall funding in there and that's the highlight of his um his uh fixing immigration\nSo you know he could towards some arms some back door negotiations in a lot of this can go on a in the you know in in the back rooms of the ... Congress\nThe negotiating doesn't have to be done out in front but this president has done a great job of messaging and he knows how to tweak these these are individuals in Congress including the GOP\nOr to get something done because he's not doing the president's not doing this for political purposes is doing this because he made a promise to the American people and he was going to secure the southern border and that he was going to\nUm keep these are illegal immigrants from flooding into the country\nThere were a drain on our public resources like the medical system for instance the um uh the school system for instance you have to educate these kids coming into the language barrier so you have to set up new bilingual programs that stuff costs money that that the American people have to pay for I found them interesting in the New York times column and\nThat's the New York times pointed out they're fleeing Honduras because of crime\nA gangs or poverty and no jobs and for a minute I thought they were talking about the city of Chicago or maybe Baltimore and I'm thinking if people in Baltimore American citizens and in American Ghetto who living gang infested neighborhoods climate for high crime like Chicago Baltimore another series a city's\nI'm very few jobs although that's being improved by this president in high poverty where do they migrate to so I suggested in a tweet tongue in cheek to form a caravan and migrate out of the city of Chicago in and out of the city of Baltimore these Democrats strongholds and go find some other areas some other city\nOr whether prospects are going to be better safer neighborhoods better schools so on and so forth\nYeah I mean look I mean get adequate brainy green and some of the areas that\nGoing to be better safer neighborhoods better schools so on and so forth\nYeah I mean look I mean do you get out of ... green and some of the areas out there that are in Chicago that are that that are that are dangerous and and if you really trying to escape the violence or talking to a a\nShare of ah David Clarke America First action senior vice are over there are so you know we've got the the midterms with\nAbout Eighteen days away and the thought is you know the enthusiasm really picked up because of Kavanaugh but like anything it's there's gotta be somewhat of a perfect storm happening\nAnd the facts are that the perfect storm maybe happening with this caravan the likelihood of the house I mean that's that's the big thing 'cause I think a lotta ... I think even up to a month ago\nThe Republicans were essentially in a position where they said you know what I I don't think we're going to hold the house we might pick up a ... a a Senate seat or do they have too many defend over there and especially in in in red states\nBut the house look dead are now their stock that they may save the house what would that do for the president if they were able to save the house and what would that say to do all those Democrats a lot of people out there who who feel it's a foregone conclusion that this this tsunami is coming out this blue wave\nSure there's been renewed sense of urgency\nOn the ah with the the the ... face Republican voters I've censored I travel the country continually and ah I talked to Republican voters there's been renewed sense of urgency\nBecause the cabin on because I think people are seeing what could happen if if the Democrats get control of things one of the things that ... the\nThe RMC about there was NO PLAN to to uh increase the number of seats there were just willing to see this over and say well when my will probably going to lose a few we're probably going to lose um uh some in the house\nAnd there was NO PLAN to increase the number of the the numbers here you have to go on off it's you can't defend in elections\nYou have to have a plan to increase turnout to increase your margin set you old already and I've never seen one from the are and see like you mentioned this talk about well we might hanging onto this we might go there's no hanging on so\nUm you know that's why the president's out there doing everything that he can but look you got to have good candidates and and then the president can't waste of time going to try to prop up some bad candidate\nWas running a bad champagne and thinking you know where the candidate thinks well I'll just called jump in and everything will be okay that's a whole elections working look I'm a veteran of elections I had to run a four times for elected sheriff and in Milwaukee County to county ... million people I had to get people to vote for me\nI was the largest vote getter Democrat or Republican\nUh in my uh in my county and there's a reason for that okay I Know how to get people out you got to have a good message you have to energize people and that's what I'm doing right now on behalf of um uh the president through America First action\nRallying the base so I tell people forget about the polls forget about all these blow hards on TV these talking heads he's put mass dictators\nForget about what you hear about generic ballots forget about blue waves and read some nominees water ... when it comes down to right now\nHis turnout turnout turnout whatever so I can get\nTheir base energized enough to actually participate whether it be early voting on election day\nThat's who's gonna win it's that simple this is not rocket science like pollsters tried to make it talking about a registered voters or likely older no it's the people who are actually going to show up were fill out a ballot and send it in if the early vote and if our side does that and here's what I tell people\nThat I I Can't just count on you I Know you're going to vote you gotta find two or three people\nWho have a lackadaisical attitude about mid terms and they may not vote and you have to inspire and edits\nThe old you're going to find two or three people\nWho have a lackadaisical attitude about midterms and they may not vote and you went up to inspire an energized them take them to the polls with two or three you can probably do that within your family you got a nephew or niece that just turned Eighteen\nOr Nineteen twenty and it hasn't voted yet because the the the demographic uh tends not to\nGet them out there because if we do that if we do like we didn't twenty sixteen we can maintain we meaning the conservatives you know geo period I think the two different things but we can maintain control of this house because that's what the president's going to need to continue his vision\nOf making America great again if the dams ... uh when the house\nI'll tell you right now the the the Trump vision is going to be that in the water get about wall funding forget about fixing immigration\nAt least that's going to be a palatable to\nTo us on the right uh you know you can and they're going to threaten the tax cuts to go to you all you're gonna hear about the next two years impeachment investigation\nThat's what's at stake your gun rights are at stake I mean you know wait till I said there's a lot at stake here and remind people Trump's on

they've never had money and there are those are the things that are talked about so what happens is they get this influx of of of wealth overnight and all the things they've ever dreamed of they go by\nRight ... the problem is is it's a finite amount of money\nAnd they\nDon't know how to replenish that so because of that\nThat's where they get themselves into trouble rich people have the knowledge of how to get rich and so they can replenish and or take what they are making\nAnd continue to make it a lot of times people who get in trouble with the lottery he didn't know what to do to get all this money and they go out and they spend it and they don't realize the things that come with that you buy a house it's massive that's five ten thousand dollars a month with taxes and how to operate it with all of the the stuff that goes into maintaining a house like that\nAnd if you're not bringing more money in\nIt eventually starts slowly but surely evaporate and you get money out to a

though that's not done that he would vote to impeach and so according to the competition that means that the president has committed the crime of treason primer bribery or a high crime in misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there was enough there to proceed with the trial\nYeah and that's all it's about it's about in the end is slowing down in teaching him knowing full well that you're not going to get him thrown out of office\nAnd if there is no there there were doing to the country's you this is the other thing and this is something we've talked about before you go to potentially put yourself in a situation where you look like such a obstruction is and the whole thing is you don't care about the country you care about destroying Trump and taking out Trump that you put in\nA situation where you you focus so much on it that it hurts the country maybe slows down the growth of the country people start panicking we know how ... confidence and things can be can be wavering at times and waiting and when we started to see things go and you're going to give Trump another opportunity to say look man when I had the house and the Senate\nWhat did I Do unemployment economy ... all of these things were going on they come along boom\nThey put a stop and everything talks about rolling back taxes that's all they want to do talk about doing this that and the other and then what happens everything slows down everything when I was in charge was rolling they come in here\n[noise] boom look what happens and you may give people the right to you know what he's right everything was ruined it was going good it was because we live in a world where\nAnd you may give people the right to you know what he'd write everything was ... it was going good it was because we live in a world where\nIn politics we need the other side to suck now so we feel like we can have a victory he wants to impeach he did not even waiting for the evidence yeah let's impeach\nBut two hundred and forty two years into this experiment\nWhich is the exception not the rule in world history nothing that guarantees us the two hundred and forty third or a two hundred and forty fourth it's up to all of us to stand up for that democracy\nThe best way to do that and so express it on the twenty second of October the first day of early voting and then the than election day on the ... of November but yet or to answer a question I I Do think there's enough there\nFor impeachment and if af are I Would I Would vote on\nThat sounds great go ahead do it I don't know what's gonna happen I couldn't tell you what's going to happen or if they win back\nI Know that there's going to be tons of investigations that are going to try to get his taxes they're going to do a lot of different things and what you're going to find is\nAnd and the way that our politics to set up is you know we're supposed to fight right we're supposed to look for is you know\nI I talked about what Thomas old before the great thing that he said there's there's no solutions there's only tradeoffs that's proven solution is you know two plus two is four that your solution is a solution to that problem but the trade offs or it's the give and take\nWe talk about right you're not going to get a hundred percent I'm not going to get a hundred percent\nBut the squeaky wheels demand a hundred percent or nothing they don't care about the other eighty percent that wants some sort of trade off to move something forward\n\nIt's sad it's sad that we're in this situation he was asked because he he went into the lion Ted thing the other night in their debate he was asked about calling a as I call theater theater cruise alliance head\nAnd you called Sen Cruz lions head\nWhy did you say that fear I went through a whole debate at SMU with Senator Cruz where he made up\nOne story after another and so I decided that he has been the rest of the debate responding to\nEvery single dishonest things that he said or I could uh make sure that everyone understood exactly what he's doing is not something that I feel totally comfortable with and perhaps in in the heat of the moment um I took a step too far and read it I don't know that that's that's the way that I Want to be talking in in this campaign\nYeah I I you know I found him to be very very interesting ah he wants to do a lot of things that cost a lot of money and he's already talked about raising taxes the one thing where he differs I think from some of the other Democrats is they want to take everything back to where it was like look\nWe don't need to raise the\nTaxes back to thirty five percent or these ... we can go from Twenty one percent or twenty three twenty four twenty five pay for some of these things I'm willing to listen to some of this 'cause I think some of this stuff and I think there's a better way that we could have gone about doing taxes which frustrated the hell out of me\nA with a lot of stuff that the way that they they jammed through taxes and and the brakes and they're you know [noise]\nIt is frustrating but he had some interesting things but he also talked about the expense of it and you know there's a lot of stuff he wants to do whether it's early childhood education\nTo paying for a two year degree and junior college or or some of these things you know and I'm for investing in education and I think there's a way we can invest in education I got no problem with that because I think that there were turned on her money is fantastic\nIn saying that when you want to spend\nThe return on our money is fantastic\nIn saying that when you walk to spend so much money there's only so much\nMoney to go round every time that you talked to a Democrat if they want to add a new program at some point in time you're like look if you if you raise tax rates at one percent here one percent one percent because you've got a new problem next thing you know you look up and that's when taxes rather control\nIt becomes the spending side of three two three five three twenty four twenty three actually had been to show is your Twitter you can tweet us okay so that's the trap and Van Jones are all over Pat Robertson\nAnd I listen to this about ten times this is Pat Robertson says so you know he is you know or was it to see the end 'cause you broadcast networks all you know is it ... evangelical talking about\nThe the murder of a democracy Yogi and the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United states\nGives them a hundred billion dollars worth of arms sales which is you know that's one of those things but more than that we've got to have some Arab allies we've had so many people were killed I mean we had the uh eight people were killed in Lebanon the people who have been taken hostage ... over the years I\nKnow is bad but I mean we've had all kinds of stuff but you know blow up an international last oh one portion I mean I'm Sorry\nOkay so he said you got a hundred billion dollars it is what it is but the alliance [laughter] this is how they take it on CNN\nFounded on the media was saying is that money is more important president from has made the same kind of statements\nGrotesquely calculating the cost of human life in this case it's a hundred and ten billion dollars that is a grotesque calculation to make a I Will point out this administration is not the first to make it it's the first really to make it openly\nAnd honestly and as sort of make a plea as time passed\nSo let's see here what he said again let's go over that so yes it's about money\nWrite them a hundred billion though who was alarm sales which is you know that's one of those things but more than that we've got to have some Arab allies\nBut more than that but more than that Ben Jones\nAs a person that they myself on and we and we share the that's not our minister should be talking about this um that literally the reverse of the golf balls and the teachings of Jesus Christ to put literally material a conflict with considerations over the dignity of a human soul is against Christianity\nSo disingenuous it's not even close to that he said allies\nOver and over again he said it is what it is the money is what it is and I'm no fan of Pat Robertson at all but if you stop being disingenuous he didn't say it's the most important thing he's the most important thing is what having allies\nOr as a joke or Christians have particular um whatever disagreements I might have with them and policy all on principle I used to be able to line up with him on principle you know personal morality matters these things matter when you will fall for it but at least on at the level of principle we could agree now is

I mean the president is apparently the only person willing to really hold is what it is we don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico ignore the rule of law and order\nThis is what it is we don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico ... ignore the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right what what are you but I mean they're all they're they're not criminals well ... well [laughter] they have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that de facto makes them criminals and that's why a gotta stop treating this as a PR disaster this is you know for a political standpoint\nThis is this is ... from heaven for people like yourself myself others who are concerned about the sovereignty of this country now we've got now instead of a trickle or ... you know sneaky over under the cover of darkness or climbing fences or whatever now got an open massive out in the daylight and Beijing if this doesn't\nScare the bejesus out of middle America that nothing will\nRun again we want we want people\nTo come to our country who respected enough to ... do not violate\nLaw the first chance again or game the system that is\nIn you know is the game the system as it as it exists anyway well this is talk now is if you want to claim asylum you come here\nYou you go to a port of entry and you say I claim asylum then we'll have to process them into the country then we do know beds for them so we release some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI but I but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because asylum to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression\nIs that these people are not politically oppressed this there's no such thing\nAs economic asylum only political asylum and so if you come here for the goodies for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just coming here to to you know uh to you know to you know pond yourself up on society without giving anything back with these people\nAre were water than their own country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again uh the president\nSeems to have the pulse of the people again better than any other American politician on us yeah I mean I'm Talking I was I was a shopping with the kids over the weekend\n[noise] and you know I'm In my my\nMom soccer clothes and have my son has on so nobody knows why nobody knows where I Am and my ... with my with my camouflage baseball cap on [laughter] and uh I'm listening to people's conversations about those people were outraged I Am outraged about this\nYeah the same right where I live to is is that we're we're grocery stores weekend or\nListen to people everybody was talking about this ... outraged about this nobody is nobody is it there but this except for the elites but the funny thing is that the elites never let these illegals into the neighborhoods anyway\nOh bingo well they want they they don't want their classrooms filled with people who speak multiple languages don't speak English or ...\nYou know they don't want their backyards yes there are private private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from ... has everything to do with the fact that this becomes a burden\nOn the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration puree like in ... it's it's just absurd let's let's I Wonder\nIf that's the other thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concerned about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go to the process\nI Know they don't want to do that they said well I don't have time it's too dangerous in my home country but that's not you know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to most of the world\nYes precisely\nYou know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to most of the world\nYes exactly precisely then go back and change your government\nNo no one wants to go back and change of government they want to just you know get on to get into the\nMovable mob I liked that movable mob a mobile mob it's a mobile mom [laughter]\nMobile mob is even better or none of this is what they

mob\nA crank out to play something from your dear friend John ...\nWho has moved so far laugh now that he's on a regular panelist on MSNBC this is what he said about the\nDemocrats' chances of a massive blue waves wave now slipping away because of cabin on probably this immigration and these great numbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way up um listen\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's but he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics you know the constitution was written for moments like this bit assume that we're sinful and driven by ambition an appetite and greed\nIs why they made it so hard for us to get anything done [laughter]\nThey basically bad that we would get things wrong more often than we get them right and we have proven them correct uh with with astonishing regularity\nReaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump ... the constitution sounds like Trump is supporting the constitution that liberals were were ... were were opposing the constitution so I don't understand I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful and how old are the because of of all this other stuff that's happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embrace were simple because we elected Trump\nBy the way just a racket I think the ah the blue wave is going to turn out to be a a a leaky faucet\nBut [laughter]\nI I just there's nothing I sense out their law there's no you remember Ninety four you could feel I mean I felt that there was an upheaval

I expect to be getting a job in construction very soon well of course why an strict unscrupulous builders hire people come into the United states who claim they have a skill\nAnd who are then brought into a pool of other illegal immigrants who also do these jobs\nBut you think you're getting like this great these great you know artisans or coming in and doing like the craftsman building oh please\nGive me a break um we're not calling in a caravan any longer\nUp up up up up a a\nLet's go to ... Mike line to Mike real quick I got ten seconds\nOr you know um when you just talked about African American conservative but when you just talk about African Americans are ... or ... illegal immigrants these jobs are African Americans used to do\nOr cricket oval by legal immigrants and we look President Trump for their\nWell good ... spread the word Mike spread the word in your community we have a lot more to get you coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us\n\n\n\nThe ... but a real life story from community to management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nYou know are there is a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything and there is a great way to come to this country and there is a long way and they are going about is a long way if they want to seek political asylum there is a process for doing that and we know\nThat it is important that we defend our southern border and when you talk to all of our border patrol agent they talk about the necessity\nOf doing that and I think it's in theory is that we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico can make certain that they're border is secure and that they're protecting their sovereignty book cause\nThis is not something that you know people injuring by force is not something that we should\nView as being unacceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo opponents who's very steep to this um you know take no prisoners very ... way of looking at the world people were very good at it and I just tell people that's which was I'm an actor guy\nYou've got other choice [noise] um if you want to move things forward makes compromise is try to get some solutions for immigration healthcare and all these big issues of events with one of them would be real pleased represent people trying to say one more time\nOh here's the had eight years of Obama what did they did they must have our healthcare system and we did catch and release so what is he talking about\nOh well you know just this this\nHealthcare system and we did catch and release yeah so what is he talking about\nWell you know this is this is going to be language that you hear from liberals when they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continue to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace same belief freedom hope an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's\nSovereign case and protecting our borders securing that southern border\nWasn't my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave Valley State issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one thousand\nIllegal aliens he they tend to see a haven for\nIllegal aliens in our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but this is the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them those certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think so ... would be somebody there at the border welcoming dental giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so\nI'd say like stand firm on this anti what to make certain that they care of and now they cannot just come walking into our country and receiving benefits Tennessee and want to see us to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human draft traffickers and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from\nRural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down in South West Virginia or illegal immigrants there are again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash\nA and this undermines us a worker of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond set up with us and how it has to stop\nA congresswoman Blackburn what ... what will you are in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about this there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall [noise]\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get the Senate to take that up and it that is a good place to start and to remind people is that is and executive them a program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so for putting\nAnd uh passed into law\nSo dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so putting a that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing the southern border you know ... you realize walls work anybody doubts that don't talk to Israel walls work\nAnd what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day an Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by an illegal alien who had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is rearing his grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and this is not ...\nIt's it's not right and for the families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we do you verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West Tennessee I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar update a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nRough totally and\nYeah and then he and his sons go in and do it\nRight but he said you know even in these big jobs for he and his sons to keep their ... business in in gear to keep it growing again\nAnd so these are real issues and well I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the borders secured\nEvery towns a border town every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police has endorsed to me and my race on tough on crime tough on trafficking truck on\nTough on the drug issue the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue if they see it as an issue that affects them in their community and to law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community shame\nOn again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on a ... show we've hit\nThe issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by a record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in this mid term cycle or that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them\nIncluding on trade and all and the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal\nPoll a congresswoman Blackburn\nAnd and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focus tax cuts pick on China get more manufacturing and home and it's working\nWell it is working and I'm not a fan of tariffs I like free and fair trade and in West Tennessee where I Am right now we're our farmers our sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what he was going\nEight and ... and west Tennessee where I Am right now or our farmers showers sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China China a trade war on us for decades\nCongressman how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so\nWhat they will say is if we're in a war\nWe got to be sure we win this war and it brought us what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price that that is tough on China they than stealing our intellectual property take them reverse engineering is they have been taking American Jobs and our owners will say\nOh we get it but we've got to have some great leaflets they sure when this trade war and that we open up markets today are encouraged to project us in the way they are encouraged to use as structuring their agreement on the table with talks now", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "22"}
