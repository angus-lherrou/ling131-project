he went to Africa he's a hunter and\nTrophy hunting is usually legal but it's always highly controversial [laughter] guys\nAnd this morning that target is Idaho fish and game commissioner Blake Fisher\nHe's facing calls to resign after sharing trophy photos of a recent hunting trip to Africa and an email that he shared with more than one hundred and his friends and colleagues Fisher shares photos of himself and his wife posing with at least fourteen animals they say they killed ... last month\nYeah they were booms and ... or if you go on line and you look stuff up and you look at the data there are a nuisance and a lot of places\nIt's still tough but it's that\nFuzzy thing right is that we're in fuzzy thing because if he would've caught a tiger shark and he would have posed with it people have been like if he would've killed an alligator they show on TV would gator hunters\nRight for teeth jethro with his hat sideways and they're outside\nKilling gators and nobody seems to care but this is one of those things where people get\nHere he is Posey with a giraffe this picture with a leopard saying shut a leopard super cool super lucky but it is this photo of him smiling holding up the bodies of a family of ... including a baby right there in the front that's raising them most dire writing I shot a whole family of bad loans\nYeah and now he's resigned today a and a lot of people who are out there\nWho are who who are are game honors you know even I thought James Woods who's a conservative came out last night said this stuff is ridiculous or look for some of these things and this includes like when you go out and you see a lot of these people who hunt draft and things of that nature but a lot of times they allow you to do it because\nThis draft serves no longer a purpose and you're not going to put it in a zoo and it's big enough and strong enough that it's not letting the young males continue on the lines and continue to reproduce so in doing so you're sending the herd and it looks awful horrible but this was\nYou know you've gotta you've gotta be socially you just have to be aware you have to have some idea and hunters are not thrilled by this because it makes them all up at\n... from pro hunting group Idaho for a while like says fishers actions send the wrong state knows\nHe should've been fired immediately the governor should have ... she was doing a lot of damage\nFor hunting and he said he came out and said look I haven't done anything immoral I haven't done anything wrong I didn't break the law\nAnd we had this knee jerk reaction all the time to go after people and things is it a good look no had what his life be different if he didn't send those pictures elsewhere absolutely his life would have been different if you to kill the hundred gators or a hundred shorts nobody would have\nBut when it comes to fuzzy things you don't watch\nThe pictures parking comparisons iffy so the lion was a popular attraction for visitors that is if we can feel he was killed by an American hunter and twenty fifth team\nOh God the otherness now like\nSome ... like remember what we call scissors or they look who's the piece of the line and you do get a no idea that was right the dentist got all those death threats and all that stuff you know people need to do with al ... idea a but this guy again has as as as resigned I guess today\nA but [noise] you have\nTo understand the social implications of stuff like this and know who you're showing things to\nAsk for Fisher who he tells in Idaho newspaper he was surprised at the reaction to his tramp apologizing for sending the photos but not for hunting again I didn't do anything illegal I didn't do anything unethical I didn't do anything and moral yeah\nThat may be true but now you got no job and you are you today kind of said I I you know should have done some stuff took his wife wanted to show her stuff and hunters do these and and a lot of people were like well it's it's it's wrong that hunters pay money to go out and to take down these big game it's wrong to do stuff like this well what\nAre you able to do with these animals that's the question because is it is it better if you take the animal and you do what I'm curious\nBecause you're not going to put it in a zoo because live this life in the wild and that would be cruel you are you gonna separated and keep it by itself somewhere because you want to feel good about something or you're going to take somebody's fifty grand and some of these instances are a hundred grand allow them to hunted because if you keep more they are and a lot of ways they're not going to reproduce the way they should\n\nYou would Australia kangaroos are a pain in the ass yeah that's for sure might they're huge

we have seven million job postings in the United states Rick Texas line three Rick [noise] but yeah my\nSon is a multi racial ladies apply to thing and\nIt's hard to hear Iraqi ear you must be on a speaker some little hard to hear you but your son can't find work as a college graduate high school graduate what does he\nYeah he's a naval officer is up in D.C as an adult and stop somebody wanting to get out the back back but they are looking for jobs that are paying more than like a hundred and fifty thousand like I don't think they're going to make twenty seven years old was only able experience which is a good background but he has no work experience at a real company\nMhm oh what kind of work does he want to do\nA bottle it got us dirty but he tried to get something here in San Antonio but um that happened yet so\nThat is out on your door yeah well as a defense contractor or as a a ... ... any any number of our companies that do work for the federal government have military implications on national security implications gosh there's certainly a lot of those\nI mean Trump pumped in another seven hundred billion dollars into the U.S military there's\nA limit by the way there's a lot of ways still in those contracts I have a friend who works for one of the big defense contractors he said I could write a book just send the money we waste and this company it is a scandal oh you should hurt him\nThis is unbelievable this was over the weekend incredible Rick your son should always said should shoot high but cast a wide net okay he's got to cast a really wide net\nAnd and you know give give the sense to anyone with him he's interviewing he'll ... he'll out work everybody there yeah I perform you know you're going to outperform\nTexas is a great place to work um I appreciate the call All right we'll continue to take your calls on this uh coming up we're going to talk about who is funding this migrant caravan which has now supposedly four thousand people strong\nHondurans who make per capita what is it to a two thousand three hundred dollars\nIncome but they were they get the money spent seven thousand dollars a migrant to cross the border eight five five forty lore art Arthur will join us a lot more coming up\n\n\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule that though I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a massive brain ... which of the brain and stroke\nAnd outs called ice and he joins us now art I'm I'm sure you're not surprised\nWhat was formerly called the ins and now it's called ice and he joins us now art I'm I'm sure you're not surprised that after we did away with the family separation policy which you know was unpleasant and the media obviously played a big role in\nGetting people are very outraged about that ah that this was going to continue and get worse and indeed we had a thirty eight percent jump in family units crossing the border in the month of August from the month before a so this is no surprise I assume deal\n[noise] no absolutely not a lawyer and actually an sort of surprised it took this long for a cure of and like this to assemble the fact is that you know we see these courts no constantly a hit up wearing the president's efforts to\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals' that's your purpose and come to the United states is live and work in the United states and you get relief\nYou've got to let you want it and it's a it's an incentive for those individuals to her to the United states we need to cut up as Meg that's the president's attempted to do it but Congress hasn't stepped up the task and [noise] you know frankly the fault is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to to stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be\nEnforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families so that their cases could be hurt\nQuickly so that the good cases can be separated that circa ... cases will eat that night and those folks can be returned to the United states they could also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum a lot of well they should be applying for asylum let's hope that they're not in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where are the company daily in a minors has to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a\nSettlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're afraid it doesn't matter if ... how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's a it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republicans back on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages you want to play babies how many times that we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that in order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but\nHere's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders on the Obamas\nIt comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders under the Obama administration when they had similar ah programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre run an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl in a pink shirt\nStanding next to her mother crying as border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any contraband that child traveled through the night without food how in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous drone United States is beyond me\nUh when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nWho's paying for this I think there is no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it costs to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect administration to be looking into that a lot of these people bell or you know doing this because they believe that the the the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for a very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor at this is another incentive again went back to verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory e verify that's the key is the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to catch that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so those are the good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are you know ever going to leave the country is not the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking about you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under ... they've received their due process or it's not\nLike they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no ... no way to verify that there are leading end eyes just lack the resources to go out and find ones and twos these are people\nPlus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders of removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the raft sheet that they're under a file order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries but everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work\nWhen any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter who travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and never mention anything about ... ...\nSo all he said well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the cook coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be\nThe same and I fear for I think for my family they're going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a homeland\nSecurity bill I think it was attached to that bill\nYeah it but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five to ... percent of all people who claim credible fear than to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that at the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual is removed from the United states\nDa chess needs to give that authority back to ... or ah the Justice Department needs to give that authority back ta da chest so that they can make a determination\nWhether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical part\nWell and also a as is he or someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing\nBut think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse well it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate\nA local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or a review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation of place that actually prevents the United states government investigate it whether or not that claim took place in the whole country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum pursuing we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nAre you looking for a new gun

just came off pat\nUm is still very winnable or the Republicans was killing that they do what they need to do which is and they've been very slow out of a cabinet on hearing so I think of galvanized to even before that you could see that there were voters who are quite concerned\nWith the show what I call chaos when you when you talk to voters about the potential\nNew York talking I was one of the big three I Believe um that worries immigration you have\nYou know a large majority so huge majorities of people who oppose sanctuary cities who um [noise] uh are in favor of 'em I mean who oppose I'm\nA I'm a what's happening at the border who who are worried or you have a belief that the I'm a huge huge majorities Oregon's abolishing ice which has become kind of a overnight it democratic\nParty um doctrine I'm and I'm In and who believe I'm ... and above twenty twenty Martin and people who believe that you know Democrats are\nMore likely basically to favor of the rights of the illegal aliens\nThan they are the rights of citizens it's a theme that Trump is put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um and and um it change moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the capital stop these numbers probably already been more important which is the when the argument that the Democrats if they take the house or\nProbably already been more important which is the\nWhen the argument that the Democrats if they take the house are already many of them pledge and we now have their chairman hum of there\nTo be chairman if they win this year in committee I'm sharing that are saying well we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet we're going to impeach Trump we always investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy\nAnd I'm a sense that um this is going to be chaotic chaotic and that it is going to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular presence whatever they say we know that their agenda\nSome had had a couple of days later said just to recap so you know some issues that would drive Republican turnout in maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr ... yes but we'll move was the number of Democrats and many independents civil move in the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me ah you know the Dems as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment mob\nI'm a party um uh\nAnd you know the repeal the promise to repeal every piece of a or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least much more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting out of the middle\nOne democratic socialism but Hubbard all with the idea of chaos you know whether to bang on windows they are going to disrupt the country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nSome of the law and order and I'm not as let's say hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order comedy the respect\nUm respect yes those are really good terms and then the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative that seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have healthcare and you're not going to take that away from ... to light 'em but um except for the fact of what the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nThey've socially the Democratic socialism of that bothers people and then the ... does\nOkay this is yeah hold on this is what Nate Silver of course the whole you know he's the he's the ... the statistical a journal and he practiced statistical journalism\nUm and he you know he didn't get the production right in twenty sixteen uh but this time he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a productive assumption standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it just because someone thinks\nSomething is a high probability might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable\nSo when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house\nA high probability it might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable fact so when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no it isn't enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging 'em I leave it there must be very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have a the selection disturb many many things that are under law in this election most of all by the way is what like the Trump and sixteen a fear of returning the country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress that has been made and the that that anti\nWashington anti elitism still exist very great with the issue has been for the Republicans can nationalize the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop it and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you to be inside of the shows rather than crammed into all the local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but they need to nationalize because then Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who are in the party that the the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade tweets either but when you put the big issues in front of

still have the year the woman you have a lot of these interesting women running for office a lot of them former veterans\nAnd some of them doing really well so they are the woman you're the one it could also be the year the man\nAh because well our thing with a man and masculinity being attacked in the cabin on at all\nCould also be the year of the man\nOf because well are seeing with men and masculinity being attacked in the cabin on it at all\nYeah so I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap but it goes both ways and the men uh and and again I come back to it's not just running up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remember to carry\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share of Democrats who are not happy with the way things these
