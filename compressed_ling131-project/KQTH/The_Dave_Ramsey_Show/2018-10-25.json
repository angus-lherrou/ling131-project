[laughter]\nIt's really ... you get in trouble if you are a white person who was on the Alawite or a black person and puts out a white guy that was okay as long as you would recommend it via character\nOkay so oh you can't do that okay it's horrible in this day and age I understand I understand where she's going but remember much like we talk about all the time what you say matters very little how was received by the masses matters more and she talks about Diana Ross and I think this is very very interesting\nConversation there the controversy on the plate in the New York would land as she is Diana Ross and she made her scandalous darker than it really is and people said that that was raised this and\nShe wants to look like they are out her one day I don't know how like that ... ratings on how to interact and I don't want to\nFirst of all how is ... ... yes right like if you are\nIf you're dressing up as Diana Ross because you loved Diana Ross for whatever is right you loved Diana Ross and you're going to\nGo because you're paying I'm used to be like him you know imitation was the greatest form of of what a lottery and it's not any more it's not I understand what you're saying what she's saying is if you're going one night because you love Michael Jackson\nRight\nSo the funny thing is let's say you dress up like Michael Jackson minus the chimpanzee and the drunk kid in the bed but let's say you dress up like Michael Jackson but you don't do the blackface is it a kind of implied that you're well I mean and it's Michael Jackson so that light or unusual but isn't it kind of implied right that your\n\nUncle Jack's and so that light unusual but isn't it kind of implied\nRight that your\nI mean you see what I'm going with this is like with people say the N word we want everybody saying we know what that word you're just not say what\nYou get it right so to me she\nComes out and has to do what everybody has to do now which is this giant makeover they have to take out the swords and they have to pull them everywhere and then you fall down on the sword depending on how many times that you want the audience by the way there's controversy with this will get that and say it's so she comes out today\nI'm Megan Kelly and I want to again with two words I'm Sorry\nYou may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and\nThat conversation turned or whether it has ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making there's darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume end okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nSo she starts out with that and I look if you want to go as Diana Ross and you're doing it out of respect I I Know I've never had it like I I'm just sitting here and in the fact that we've been talking about this but there there's a bigger thing at play here it's the fact that so many people are allowed to\nCome so many and and it's not a lot it's it's a few people are allowed to control the conversation where we go because everybody's worried about I better be on the right side of this so people are gonna be mad\nAt me I'm a member of God I I was a\nKid watching this thing and there was this guy who I don't know if you remember the show producer Phil there used to be this lip sinking show on it was on after like solid gold or American Bandstand or one of these things and this guy dressed up half is Diana Ross and I think the other half as a they did mindless love was that the one uh Richie\nAnyhow and a half and a half and it was amazing today could you do that you can't ...\nI'm Wondering when are people gonna steps that you know you can't be a drag queen because you're in your your your culturally appropriating females which is happening by the way but she wasn't finished here\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by race it in this country\nIt is not okay for that to be part of an economy in Halloween or otherwise I have never been a few thing kind of person but I Do understand the value in being sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity this past year has been so painful\nFor many people of color the country fails so divided and I have\nNo wish to add to that pain\nOkay All right I mean look I I understand that but you were talking about somebody dressing up like Diana Ross paying homage saying it's OK you weren't talk and when you talk about and a racist or did you think that raises are listening to you're going oh my God guys you know before we go burn this cross\nI really need to get my fix of Megan Kelly cause no they're not they're not paying any potential there are idiots out that there will always be it\nBut\nI'm going to throw them out there but it's just really you don't have the same age we grew up watching many of the same shows did you ever once in your life with your friends play cowboys and Indians\nAll the time cultural appropriation\nTo the Halloween store looking all the stuff it's fun is it meant if it's meant it here in this is the way I've always looked at stuff\nGo to the Halloween store looking all the stuff it's fun is it meant if it's if it here and this is the way I've always looked at stuff people who want it to me at a certain way particularly if they want to be awful\nWhere they began message they're going to do that anyways they are\nI think the fact that NBC and everybody is destroying her shows you though that more people are worried about the kill if you will in this media world than they are the message\n\nThat dancing came several years ago he was dating Whoopi Goldberg at the time right like\nCrazy he showed up I think it's something and he was in blackface and people were offended and he's with Whoopi Goldberg and it was her idea well times have changed we've gotten much more woke now we've got much more sensitive\nWas it meant that he made it in a racist way now he didn't he didn't mean it in a racist way but it's no longer how it's meant in life it's how it's perceived I don't think she did anything wrong\nBut I Do do that this time next week it's Halloween and we will talking about the horrible costumes that people were oh my God this person did that or that person did this and you know it's like ... and I was talking to some of the other day it's like well dreadlocks like somebody was mad at I forgot who it was it wasn't a a\nA one of the stars when the young kids has got dreadlocks and there were like oh it's cultural appropriation I'm like really cause the Greeks had dreadlocks\nAnd then people get into an argument about whether or not that Israel and like this is the kind of stupidity that we live in now we're debating stuff like this\nGet over it hair right and if people are racist an awful you being Hoover politically correct doesn't change that because they're not paying attention to you\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at me and I'm sure I'll get some aid for that and I'm

hadn't received vaccinations by the time they were two years old roughly one point three percent of those kids didn't get the shop and\nIncrease over time of point three percent him all doctors say parental choice plays a role that parents choosing not to vaccinate their kids believing erroneously that the shot themselves are harmful\nThey say access to the vaccines is a barrier coverage rates are low is for kids who live in rural areas or don't have insurance\nGet your kids vaccinated please get your kids vaccinated\nI I don't you know we're seeing that these ... their kids dying this polio like thing and did all of this stuff is happening and people are running around because they read some blog somewhere that your kid is going to get something that is going to kill them\nOr I'm not saying look any time you get a shot or anything there's always this it's like it's like surgery there's a risk involved but you have to ask\nYourself is the risk\nGreat\nI mean the reality is that things that we eradicated are coming back\nAnd it's\nIt should be should be no brainer is the way I look at it you know we talk about you know get the bombs going off you know not going off of being founded CNN and all this stuff today and we got the caravan coming down with all of these things that the people are talking about and then you start to look at it okay what's really going on out there\nWhat's really happening well we're real issues out there and this was one of those things this is one of those things where like this is important because if if we get to the point where we're slowing down our vaccinations and we're starting to see a a an increase of things that we should have eradicated\nAnd we did eradicate and were virtually gone and in some cases completely gone and all of a sudden they're starting to pop up again and all of a sudden we're sort of the incidents and all of a sudden we're starting to see was\nSeven kids in New Jersey died seven kids in New Jersey seven kids dead\nDoodle viral ... outbreak people will look you're echoing what's going on here eleven\nSick could that have been prevented I don't know\nIt's little things like that and it's only when there's a mass\nGroup of people that start to do this and as we all know it doesn't take a lot of people saying that I don't want to do that\nBecause of I read a blog or something like that it it's frustrating it's for us it is it is absolutely frustrating three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet at us I did not win\nThe lottery last night I was a I got to be honest with you feel like expected to win [laughter] you wouldn't be vote I'd\nYeah I'd I'd I didn't know about you but either you know I had already you know started closing up things and today was going to hell day that's what I'm saying is everybody go down they just get that I don't want any part of this but apparently I didn't know there is a chance\nFor six hundred and twenty million tonight\nThere is a chance for you to win six hundred and twenty million dollars a night which really it's so sad because let's just say you one that you walk away with two hundred million dollars after your cash pat and the whole nine yards\nIt's very anti climatic or like this sucks I only got two hundred million dollars a guy who won yesterday the gallon one yesterday she has five hundred and thirty eight million which is why I did the math for everybody you guys don't have to when it comes to the lottery\nYesterday the gallon one yesterday she has five hundred and thirty eight million which is why I did\nThe math for everybody you guys don't have to when it comes to the lottery so\nA hundred and Seventy eight million right around there is what it is the cash payout not the annuity you take the cash you get eight hundred and Seventy eight million that's before taxes with federal taxes the taxes are going to take in South Carolina\nA and everything you will of walk somewhere between five hundred and twenty and about five hundred and forty million dollars cash and that is if all singular person wanted as we all know there could be plenty of people that want it ah we don't know\nWe don't know God what if it was if you win like here's the thing Phil like so let's just say you with us and and for you guys out there\nYou're excited you want to win it but then you want it in a group of fifty right it's your entire human resource organization the one\nThat all of a sudden goes down from X amount of dollars to ten million dollars\nAnd like oh\nThis is the only oh that's why I was hoping it it's just one person one\nJust one person want it 'cause I Want that person to feel it and I know that sounds like I just I I Do I think it's great to integrate it changes your world let's not pretend to doesn't\nBut man if you're in a group of fifty or a group of twenty it does change everything you know like this sucks right like I thought we were I mean it's amazing because I didn't have it for five hundred and thirty would've been nice\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you All right let's talk some other stories\nWe got the cars show gay thing what do you hear the new thing this every day you know what it is anymore\nI'm not even paying attention because we know how horrible it was it's the lives they continue to tell and how they change on a daily basis that I find to be fascinating\nBecause we know the murder is done we know it's over we know that the ... it's it was heinous but the lives or laughable the caravan is still on the way here and Megan\nKelly what did you say and will you ever be forget the ... [noise]\n\n... Benson show [noise]\n\nAre you fifth year older okay\nI'm not going to ask you to raise your hand so don't worry but I Do want to ask you have you sign up for a Mac yet if your answer is no why it's a

access\nAnd we're either going to find out that the thing that I picked was right or going to find out that wasn't wrong and then we can reverse our course but without making the decision nothing was going to happen and that's what we've got with ... with our ... our political world across the board without making decisions nothing gets done\nAnd that's the frustration I think a lot of you have out there and this is one of those things where this thing is coming here\nRight\nThese people are coming here this wave is coming here and while it is it is a it's a micro when the overall scheme of things when you look at the the the visa program and the ports the reality is is they're arguing over this and well as a well they're arguing it's just going to\nShow and they're just going to come here and then nothing will get done and all we'll figure it out is they like to argue even more than we thought\nThat's it period case closed and it gives both sides the opportunity to come out and say things\nYou think there are wonderful people you got some bad people on those groups you got some tough people in those groups and I'll tell you what this country doesn't want them\nRight then come out and they can say that and they can also say hey that this person over here is bad and this person's bad or it's it's frustrating but it's not solving the problem the caravans on the way a lot of people I don't know and by the way this is the first caravan\nNow a second smaller caravan that also formed in Honduras have already in Guatemala heading north to the Mexican border and there are all over for some other pair of an forming an El Salvador\nMine\nYeah why not really I Do the same thing opportunity\nAnd I'm Salvador mine\nYeah why not really I Do the same thing opportunity coming\nWho's in these caravans I don't know\nI don't know who's in these caravans are but I Do know that there I see some kids I see a lot of women I see some working age or you know men as far as like you know from probably their mid genes through through the early twenties or thirties when people are gonna come construction and things of that nature and you see some older people as well\nThere are people in the U.S I think\nIt's a responsible for mothers to bring children here in the center for some of them are some that are not something we're not irresponsible she sat hunger is driving us out and you have to take risk with your children if you don't you'll have nothing [laughter] how long did she not even for the\nWhole thing and that's awful it is as a human being I can look and say that's awful here's my question for many of you can ...\nWhy don't you marching on your own capitals I just don't have thrown out right just a just a thought in my mind\nThat maybe just maybe instead of marching elsewhere so you turn around and go you know maybe we should think about marching on her own capitals and asking questions that are being asked to ensure the hell are being answered by\nAny of our governor any of our government\nSo that's a is the latest in the cover ups are and what a joke it it really is an absolute\nJoke this whole could show the thing is joke and remember don't look at it from the snapshot of which is I'm Talking to people yesterday said why do we care about this guy I'm like it's not just this guy\nRight thinking about the bigger picture when it comes to Saudi Arabia their new leader all of this stuff this is just another thing to add to it\nOriginal concept was carried a poorly and the cover up was one of the worst in the history of cover ups Percival bad deal should have never been thought of somebody really messed up\nAnd they had the worst cover up ever and were should've stopped is at the deal stand what when they thought about it 'cause whoever's on that idea I think is in big trouble and they shouldn't be in big trouble\nTrump's like look I Know BS right like I I I Am a showman I Know how to work it exists didn't even pass my smell test this was awful\nNothing that they've done has has them well certainly has not been spoken of properly they deserve all things even thinking about the idea they certainly that advantage of execution and they certainly did a bad job of talking about it or covering it up and he's like what I Would say it was a total fiasco\nAnd I'll say it because you guys all thought of it I think they did a good job in the execution I just think give us the story that was bad and now the crop without so then I got a new ones the crown prince spoke today and apparently will showcase kids was there and gave him as you so eloquently put up what is your fill the stinky guy\nI spoke with the crown prince yesterday and he strongly said that he had nothing to do with this this was at a lower level\nYeah that's the new thing it's at a lower level it's ... and he's come out today it's awful it's horrible it's file it's disgusting it is we're going to find out who did this who did this General McChrystal\nDo you believe that an operation like this could be carried out by rogue elements without the crowd\nIs who did this General McChrystal\nGamble either in an operation like this could be carried out by rogue elements without the crown prince of Saudi Arabia having knowledge of it or approval of it\nI think maybe in some states could in Saudi Arabia I don't find that credible if it is that's not how Saudi Arabia where now I mean the crown prince as an amazing at about a power and he has been pulling power him for the last couple of years [noise] so the reality is I just not find they'll find that convincing\nNow that I don't either the guy knows everything that's going on there period case closed and the story he knows everything that is happening there\nEverything everything\nIt's not somebody and and the fact that they Fifteen people flew in\nDifferent times all this stuff like I say the the act itself was heinous and disgusting the cover up is laughable and every day they have a new story and the fact that he came out today and gave this like weird\nPress conference where he's like this is disgusting and violent horrible and we're going to do everything we can get Sherlock Holmes on the phone we're going to sort this out that is just laughable three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned shows your Twitter tweet at us love

Donald Trump is the only one who has been using violent rhetoric and Bob ... suggest endorses violence than\nYeah that mass shooting potential mass shooting where it would have been a\nA disaster if we didn't have smart security onsite eight five five forty Laura let's go to Demitri Colorado line to to me Trey\nLaw I'm I wanted to say a ... it just reminds me of that I stuck fire up like thirty four where when things are going back for one party you throw in a distraction and then use that distraction as a bludgeon the blessing people with politically so what's happening here\nThat people in which bombs are being set up to them\nBut what was going off I mean clearly not one of them go off I mean it was the damage your bottom layer that one goes off\nYet when that a liberal there I was getting a lot of conservatives are attack they you know at least they get shot or something happens to this sounds like a the bad things are going for the uh the Democrats and all of a sudden\nLook bad and they can they have anything going for them so they start sending all that well\nYeah well again this is what I'm seeing a lot of on on line and I'm I'm gonna try not to speculate because I don't I don't want to say anything until the facts are and um but I we do know what happened in June of twenty Seventeen that the media spent not that much time\nReally unpacking what motivated James T Hodgkinson to almost kills the skull lease with the goal of killing as many as he could and that congressional baseball game baseball practice\nNow he wrote on Facebook here's a Republican that should lose his job but they gave them a raise and it was a company by a cartoon depiction of Steve ...\nThey did the ... you know it it was horrible and a half and everyone had a moment of unity in Congress came out and give them a standing ovation when he came back so that was nice and everybody\nAppeared thing we reject this of course they did a member of their uh you know their own congressional body had been you know it was hanging a thread his life was hanging on a threat but then the story really didn't\nI don't think the story is shut down all of the media for days and days and days man they covered other stories\nOr let's go to John in Florida on line for John [noise]\nHey Laura thanks lesson I just wanted to point out what can be is a kind of eerie similarity between the string now a veiled\nBombs or bomb shit quotation marks and be straying are\nIncreasingly salacious a accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh during the hearing as they approached confirmation vote for me it ... a pattern of orchestrating ... with the agenda sporting a trunk and Republicans\nIn a complete ... I just would be interested to hear your comments on that I Know\nWell it seems again if this is someone who is a fan of Donald Trump then it's got to be someone who's insane I'm just completely nuts as what I mean people who do this have an ... an element of of\nEvil all all combined in my view but I'm not an expert on you know tracing bombs I I don't know I'm not a profile or of these situations that's why we're going to speak to protest\nI'm not an expert on you know tracing bombed I I don't know I'm not a profile or of the situation that's why we're going to speak to profile ers who will tell us what this seems like people who know what bombs or when they're designed to go off look like and what they must contain\nBut at the the the list of targets are all Democrats than all outspoken critics of President Trump eight five five forty Laura we'll talk to hide camps challenger in North Dakota coming up\n\nDoes your dog it scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by ordering Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nI'm along comes to Brett Kavanaugh opportunity to demonstrate in a substantive way\nFirst eight nine months of this year\nI'm along comes to Brett Kavanaugh opportunity\nTo demonstrate in a substantive way that you stand with North Dakota and ... and with President Trump when he is right for North Dakota and of course she not only did she bought against the confirmation of of a great judge who's by the way very good for North Dakota or many of his his opinions and dissent a defense\nBecame of course the majority opinion and the Supreme Court over things like EPA overreach and in in many areas what land water air a just a brilliant judge for for North Dakota when he's on the DC circuit\nAnd so she has this opportunity to to prove or brand and she blows it by voting against him and her whole brand went right out the window\nAnd then of course campus is like if she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota's code a mindset in the\nThe spirit of North Dakota which is one of I hearty courageous a well still still has that frontier feeling well then that's not a very populous um state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair\nAnd I think most people just law that you know and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cabinet thing because again her everything she pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing kept an eye but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a professor poured then she didn't believe\nHim but believe professor for it and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned often noticed his demeanor\nYou know just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota law that the independent spirit the rug and is\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nMy then media have had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias and it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just peroxide dozens of frenzy and fury and upset and\nAnd the last always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with\nThe Trump critics but I think people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than a one lesson that you\nYou know assuming un which looks like you're going to um congressmen in North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period in politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride in last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and I you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is let's return to a respect for states you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states\nWill show the way and North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states at places like California\nNorth Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies on locked it but but because places like California that have lots of it\nHas screwed it up okay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump is done he's restored\nYou know states' rights and and that's what ... what do you have a cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find the federal government is far more efficient\nAnd much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you don't have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences or officers of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought is let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of this leads before we create something different than than the reality that it that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior and what contribution if any we make to this\nThis discourse that's going on this lack of civility in a without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nYou know it's a great way and I'm putting it um and we really wish you the very best in this\nElection coming up on November sex Kevin Cramer I think it'd be the next senator from the great state of North Dakota I think North Dakota is the only state in the whole country I haven't been to Congress and I got a guy\nBut we do I love to give you that opportunity perhaps for

forth but does that tell us anything\nThe kind of obvious nature of this last [laughter]\nYeah I I mean I guess that speaks to uh some some motives behind why they're doing it I mean\nIt's it's detracted from any other news that's on there on the TV right now this is the rate at the front view of everybody right now\nSo I don't know what political motives are trying to establish your what they're trying to ideologies are trying to push forward but the bottom line is is there's a clear cut a destruction of of normal normal news that would be out there\nAnd when you think about how this individual would be track what again with authorities be looking at\nLooking at um you know trying to establish who the person did it or not to give away all the investigative techniques but I mean right up right up front you'd be looking at a fingerprint analysis from the ... the device or um you know the other other um\nAt a fingerprint analysis from a tape of the device or um you know the other other um [noise] ... that you can use to to get um DNA evidence off of off of the device if in fact it was west I mean you're never gonna have a completely sterile um uh item there\nAre especially since this wasn't render safe by a I'm a bomb squad um there's lots of entry a value to this um which they should be able to ascertain a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a ah they've had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\n[laughter] that's all well ... yeah it is odd and you would think or someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean\nAre there has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service to who who you know where they picked it up or they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate um another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nIn in in you really wanted it to cause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb like this through\nThe postal service because it's too easily detected is there anything to that\n[laughter] well I mean if you looked at her you know historical data the uh\nBombs have been used you know through the mail um\nEspecially when you have like a you know Ted Ted Kaczynski and what you did it or do the Unabomber stuff I mean you can
