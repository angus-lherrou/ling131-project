seven percent of the cases\nThat's that's pretty damn good right I mean it was climate change be all over but if it fits right gee\nSo\nWell look at this and this one thing we're going to touch on throughout the evening is the fact that I think there's two camps here you've got an older generation a jet actors you know mid to late\nThirties ended the fifty forties and fifties and sixties who who who who lived\nIn a day and age of the Mad Men and some not so much of the crazy eighties and things of that nature and then you've got a younger generation of micro aggressions and things of that nature and when you look at this I think there is the two wasted this me too movement is going a lot of women want\nTo understand the things that they have gone through that have been absolutely awful\nThe things that they've gone through that that really they they want people to know\nAnd we absolutely should may have another generation which I Believe the younger generation is is looking at this is this is a weapon\nRight and it's not the way it's not just the me too movement for the younger generation the fact is micro aggressions things of that nature British ... you and I talked about this with the yesterday\nThat company last year where the interns decided they wanted a new dress code because they thought it was sexist and it was wrong and they went into the guy who owns a company and then the next day he fired them all\nAnd they couldn't understand why they couldn't understand why and this is the issue I think a lot of people are saying you've got two camps here fighting and it's it's it's really amazing to see because when I talk to younger generation\nIt is you got to believe everybody period case closed when I talk to an older generation they still believe in due process\nThey couldn't believe what you're saying but they also want facts the younger generation just believe what you're saying or what somebody and they don't even care about facts you're guilty and even if you're proven innocent we're never going to change your mind about your and they'll use that\nAnd that is and like I said I think part of it as being titled ... world that we live in for these young kids all of us in some\nWay shape or felt we had a little bit of entitlement the differences we've raised an entire generation with your the past year the greatest you're all of this we have a lot more parents mowed down everything in their path we've got people who've told their kids with the greatest things in the history of the world everybody gets a trophy my generation are little one time we knew we all do you get a trophy\nRight genetic we knew that right mom and dad might have thought you were great but they always reminded you that the world may not think your great it's different here\nYou're micro aggressions with all of this stuff and I think the ... there is a there is a big gap between how an older generation has gone through stuff and the younger generation where even looking at somebody is considered sexual assault\nIt it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out it really really is three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... best in show is your Twitter we've got a whole area is [noise]\nStory about cheerleader speaking of young kids are and and and brownies we'll talk about that but first let's look at the economy more

E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase for these past fourteen years among others uh would say that he did not himself need a tax cut but I think there's broad agreement that the piece that has to do with empowering business to do better on the world stage\nDid need work and uh so I think the president and his Republican counterparts on Capitol Hill deserve um the credit\nTo the extent that they did advocate for abroad bit of tax relief a which is helping the economy probably for the next couple of years so there's I don't think there's any getting away from that\nTalking to mark ... dot com as we discuss the economy and because we all see that's the one thing I started telling me we all share and the economy I get what you say you're right laugh is not my president he's my president tribal politics all the stuff we all share and the economy we buy things we sell things we work we have homes and things have got to take care of\nRight now the market itself is the job market is good you're seeing more and more people to feel confident enough to quit their jobs in it and I always like when people say well you know the growth rate for for jobs as far as money is it what it was it a lot of ways I tell everybody gets very rarely do you get a raise in your work a lot of times what you do is you jump across the street\n'cause they're willing to give you a raise in your company is not going to match so there's a lot of that that I don't think gets added in when you look at this marketplace you look at the job place if you're somebody right now\nIs is a great time for entrepreneur is is a great time to jump jobs is a place where you feel like now is the time to strike\n[noise] well I think you know first of all if you're operating in the United states of America and again in a political comment as a nationalistic comment as it turns out if you're operating in the usa\nYou have the opportunity to do something that no one else in the world can do because we have\nThe widest deepest capital markets\nWe have the greatest uh innovation in off the planet and that's why we continue to create companies that do things that really don't exist anywhere else so all large businesses used to be small businesses we know the legends about Steve Jobs and\nA Jeff Bezos beginning in their garages so they were small businesses to begin\nA there are some measures out there that suggests and there are a little controversial but there are some measures out there that\nSuggests that small business isn't growing as well as it used to\n'em and I'll just sort of\nLeave that there for the moment ah and there are some who are sharply critical of the growth of the likes of Facebook Google um Amazon the list goes on and on saying essentially a they are crippling tech entrepreneur ... by essentially doing what Facebook did buy\nA essentially buying Instagram and then seems to be in the process of killing Snapchat so there you know those are all inevitably a questions that have as much to do with regulation as anything else but to the broader point I think it's All right now is a superb time to\nTo be starting a business and you know people always have challenges no matter what the point in our history or they happen to be doing that you know if you people succeeded by building businesses in the midst of the depression\nFor goodness sake and on the same can be said of in two thousand seven two thousand two thousand nine so if somebody has low vision has a great idea and is willing to work hard ah the United states as a as a great place to do that as anywhere I think\nA man I Love having you on my man will do it again next month or more cameras the man with the gold voice in bakery dot com have you have a good weekend we'll talk to you soon\nYou're very kind of like a much always a pleasure to be like you\nAt your bits shows your Twitter C.

with pro choice or pro life cause you don't think much about it you're moving on with you if you don't take away anybody's choice that you don't want nobody want to talk about it and a lot of people

us love hearing from you so movies coming out as a couple of movies stars born I think is is like the twenty eighth adaptation of this movie\nAnthony ... is one of thirty seven and I couldn't find he was right there was one I guess Judy Garland\nAnd then there's another one obviously with ah Chris christopherson and Barbara Streisand and then you've got Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper one coming out today and the fight is on his like how good is this movie will say Bradley Cooper is the best movies ever done he things in it you're gonna be amazed to hear it and it's kind of keeps pretty much straight\nDown the line and and this Lady Gaga is first movie role she's done I think she did American horror story she doesn't other stuff was the first big acting role in the movie and everybody says she's greater voices amazing [noise] then movies coming out today that I'm interested Jack and are going to go see it tomorrow what's called venom what the hell are you [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nSo dumb parties in this movie and it's very interesting\n\nBecause a lot of people think this is a shot at Silicon Valley because you've got the ABC\nRight near the

looking how we can merge bodies together and willing to maybe do things that are unscrupulous and doing some of these things and a lot of people say this ... this movie right here is Iran mosque is the villain\n'cause you got this young upstart ... guy who is for all intents and purposes a\nBuilding and trying to create something and with this stuff he finds in space through space travel lo and behold this is what it is and its venom and Tom already gets infected with this stuff in the way it goes and you know the craziness and the power of him being able to shape shift and I find it to be rather interesting 'cause I'm like yeah\n'cause I think there is that worry right that that that you look at the Facebook's in Silicon valley's with the world and the the alphabet corporation to the of of you know the Google's in and out of all of these people in the control the amount of money the things that are doing that we don't know they're doing\nYou know like why is Google and all of these companies trying to extend life what are they looking for what are they trying to do\nYou know the way that they're there that you know they can control like a lot of the media right like

doctor gives us the thumbs up are going to go see a couple of movies and just relax a little bit and we're gonna see venom in small fee 'cause that's how we roll\nRight but it is interesting to see that said and I that's what I'm telling you that if we can do something that has nothing to do with politics\nIs just get out of the political way just say I want anything to do with politics\nI'm I'm stepping away from this I'm going to go see a movie that is not depressing that it's Ninety minutes or an hour of the ...

Republican shit finally grown aback bull [noise]\nAh that's very interesting ray you know I I don't know if that's right or not it John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabin up a prior to his death than I think if he had not a guide Neal if you if he'd been you know well and present than voting I I think you would have supported a cabin uh [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was always this big question mark you you know you never knew when he was gonna go rogue and abandoned his party I thought he was bigger than his party\nOr a ... and that and that can be dangerous so so after after running three or four times on a platform of abolishing Obamacare\nEvil or to keep it and and apparently he did that just out of spite uh because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways and I think over over his time in the Senate he became more and more of a loose cannon and uh I I think I think the the the person who with respect to his your theory mice half the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham was always the junior maverick er he was always a\nHe was always John McCain's a wing man and and um and uh with McCain are gone\nMaybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting is a contrarian impulse as at precisely the worst moments or thanks for that call re if if if you want to be hurt eight five five forty Laura is the number to call\nYou know I wrote a post on a on power line on friday and and it was titled or where do we go from here and it's got a lot of attention and it was a link down real clear politics a lot of other places and has been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand a people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about\nAbout that posted about some of the things that I that I said there and um and and and where I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd really the conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and and I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post that where do we go from here or by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history\nThe Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander as the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right I paused there for a moment at the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous\nA Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating but at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted than lied about but they but they did at least purports to relate to things you might do as a judge\nHere we have the Democrats are trying to claim that Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school students believable or the smears that the the slants\nYou know the people would die in the streets so if one isn't going to get angry about that I'm not quite sure when when one would get angry\nI'm quite confident that if you had remained calm and robot like that the response would have been well clearly he must have done the things that he was accused of because somebody who was truly innocent would've been a ... to this and would have shown that\nA by you know being a little angry in responding to those charges so I really think the ... and damned if you get into the fact that twenty four hundred a walk professors or you might as well throw in former Justice John Paul Stevens\nA leap into this when everything else failed a hardly surprises me in and you know there may be a perhaps a dozen quote unquote conservative professors among that list but I have not the slightest a doubt that if I Am in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left\nAnd that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nYeah I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turn now Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabin on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that\nNot to show people he was he was sincere and I and I pocket that that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and\nWhatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling you know person you may or may not think that she did that Kavanaugh had done something to her\nBut clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to close her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now asked me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out\nExactly as strongly as she did and said you are now trying to destroy\nA reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges and I'm not going to play along with this\nI think that he he very much help his uh his claws and had he come out and being at a flat aspect or when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know the nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation jak let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm I'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do what one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined\nAnd and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the production or they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact\nTrying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped self in that regard because it involved itself in more and more social issues frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know ... that is what people are trying to do\nI I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but ... before the\nIn to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but\n... before the presidential election you had with Peter Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she thought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving administration and coke policies\nNobody was filing recusal motion to get her\nA to draw away and nobody expressed of the kind of outrage towards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage that you are hearing at the beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh who all after all only challenge the tactics of a few senators on the Democratic side of the judiciary\nA committee you know it ... impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote or whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives after he would be impeached\nThen it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office\nAnd there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but of the\nThe Democrats who showed up and as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices of it and and all the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so crane is I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do with roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that there with with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there is a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been craze uh ever since ... election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nUh for folks are on the left have been predicting the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court or starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to farm\nOr wrote the opinion that we affirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court or would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed\nVery very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade to be revisited in overturned my prediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be outright overturned than it will be ...\nMy prediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be outright overturned than it will be that more restrictions placed on uh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be upheld that's\nHow kids tend to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you have states it would have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of the full frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the court I have no idea exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative sweat along with overturning roe\nJohn Malcolm thank you very much for being on the program we're going to go to a break that will come back with more on the cabin a nomination and your calls at eight five five forty Laura Laura

and he has been taking Obama at his word for some years\nWhat we're seeing today is mob action by Democratic Party activists harassing Republicans when they go out to dinner or walk through

assaulting Republican officeholders\nI wrote yesterday about Kelly Paul's appeal to Cory Booker to withdraw his incitement to violence Kelly Paula course Rand Paul's wife Rand Paul was attacked by a
