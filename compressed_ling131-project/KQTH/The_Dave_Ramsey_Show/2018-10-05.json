I've said you know because I have my own studio I'm In my own studio around very few people and there's nobody else yeah I've got my other producers and they're scattered all over the globe and the universe and and whatnot is I don't know if I Want to be alone with somebody\nBecause the thing of what happened oh in this day and age and that is\nThat people like oh and I got so many emails text messages tweets all kinds of stuff so you know what I feel the same way\nI got a business I I I Can't afford it I Can't afford it not that I don't\nThe emails text messages tweet all kinds of stuff so you know what I feel the same way\nI got a business I I Can't afford it I Can't afford it not that I don't want to but I'm at the point where I'm scared I've got friends who have companies who will not hire women anymore and they now separated the men and women in in the financial world because of that situation\nIt's it's weird\nRight like you don't want to say something like a feel for no it's what you're doing is you see why in yourself and nobody wants to stay in Ninety nine percent of the women just like Ninety nine percent of the men find an old to be ridiculous\nBut what about that other one percent of men who are scum bags and women who will take advantage of something to both of them are sociopath\nThat's the issue that is the issue it really is\nAnd I you know what I don't blame people I Do not blame people\nLook if you're in a group of a bunch of people even at this point it's like being in a group does it matter than the other thing is is you could be getting along with somebody for years\nAnd then something happens\nAnd that person is let go or for financial reasons any of these things and then it's on all you all of a sudden all those jokes you told for years and she told you jokes back all of a sudden those have become bad because the goalposts moved and it's it's a nightmare\nIt is it is it is it is\nAnd I get why people are like yeah you don't know if I wanted this any more I don't I don't know I don't know if I can afford this and other people say are not like that but in their mind that like I'm totally like that ... I understand\nWhy wrong\nAnd it's wrong to say something like that because you know you're like oh goodness me why wouldn't you hire somebody but the fear factor is out there it is three\nTwo three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet us love hearing from you craziness kids craziness so I'll just take a deep breath has to taco citizen national talk all day and it's a gesture [noise]\n\nSuch as best in show [noise]\n\n\nAre you fifth year older okay well I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand so don't worry but I Do want to ask you have you sign up for a Mac yet if your answer is no\nWhy it's a free membership for one year you don't even have to give them credit card information and just for signing up here's some of the stuff you're going to recede just some forty percent of movie tickets access\n\nThey're told that their values are stupid they're told that their values are useless that they're old fashioned there beside genetic patriarchy absolute crap that they're just a bunch of more on who's knuckle drags\nAnd they're lucky they could find their way home at night\n\nAnd then like you know [noise] you know what\nThey look at cabinet and they say it kind of shares our values right seems believe that clean life hoping he drank oh come on everybody off your high horse\n\nSeems to love he he he kind of like we are yeah flyover kind of guy and now you're telling him he said destructive horrible evil human being\nAnd then all men are bad and that you got to believe everybody and due process is a waste of time in oh you're telling them all this and all of a sudden what once was it seemed to be an insurmountable lead in the polls has now evaporated\nAnd should be a huge warning signs of the Democratic party because all year we've been talking about how democratic enthusiasm has been outstripping Republican and how that could lead to the eventual blue wave you know everything Republican\nOr have tried to increase the boozy as them so far had fallen flat whether when tax cuts are talking up the broader economy even the threat of impeachment to the president\nNothing really fired up the Republican base until now\nYeah and part of that is because for the last\nTwo years they've been told how racist they are how stupid they are how the domestic countries in is all of their fault\nTwo years they've been told how racist they are how stupid they are how the Mets the countries in his all of their fault they'd been\nDevalued over and over again and this Kavanaugh thing has really hit them in the face and it is it is amazing and I don't think they\nUnderstand that they don't\nCause they live on oceans\nAnd because they live on oceans they feel that there's so much better than everybody else that everybody else is just a bunch of ... and then they shouldn't have the right to vote and vote shouldn't count as much in their their opinion shouldn't count as much and and and and all of these things and then they're looking this guy and as soon as I get torn apart and they're realizing what a bunch of BS this is\n\nAnd I'm not talking about whether or not it's true not just the way the entire thing was handled how political it became and they're looking at their values getting shot down and their value is getting attacked over and over again and now they're stepping up and say you know what I wasn't really going to get involved in this but I think it's maybe I I I just might\nWhat do the numbers show about who the public would prefer to control Congress Democrats or Republicans right all year it's been true that Democrats have led on the question they continue to lead on this question but only by sticking point now that's been cut in half\nIn the past month and guess what all of that movement in in the past week has been among men just in the past week those men have gone from being evenly split on whether they'd vote for a Republican or Democrat in their district and now saying they prefer Republican by ten point\nYeah yeah and you know why 'cause they're looking over there and what are they saying they're seeing themselves get bashed over and over again they're looking at themselves thing I could easily be judge Kavanaugh I could easily be a guy partied a little bit in high school had a little bit fun I could easily be in this position like that\nI could easily be be be told\nThat I I I'm a rapist an every man is sick and tired of hearing how horrible they are let me tell you some ladies you know this right now the talking heads that are out there you know angry and pissed at the world you know sitting on CNN so boxer or any of these other shows but we're we're talking about real women have that they're working their butts off doing their thing is going through you understand\nYou get it men are sick and tired of being sold out horrible there we all know rape is bad even amongst criminals right I understand this amongst the worst people on earth\n\nThere's a code in a hierarchy rapist and child molesters will pay a price in prison you don't make good men living good lives out there don't understand that but we have to preface everything oh let me say this first rape is bad\n[noise]\nThey're sick and tired of area they're sick and tired of being pulled their entire life for the last Twenty years the only way that they are where they ours because there are a man or because of this because of that it's never because of who they are the graves nobody in the world is\nThe individual that's been taken away now we're lumped into categories year in categories there in categories year categories there and it's ridiculous and men are getting blamed for everything and they're sick and tired of it and look at the Republicans going I may not believe a lot of what you're saying but I'm sick and tired of being called the demon\nHe also stressed that there's um a month from the election any number of things can have happened in that amount of time and whether Kavanaugh eventually get through or is eventually sunk will really have some influence on how fire to Republican voters are anything can happen in those thirty four days yeah\nAnything can happen absolutely true and it's a lifetime and between now and\nYou think can happen in those thirty four days yeah anything can happen absolutely true and it's a lifetime in between now and that day that everybody goes stuff is going to happen\nTrump is going to cause a stir something good may happen some bad things may happen there may be a a a tragedy that takes place that takes her eye off stuff or or or focuses on something it's a long time\nBut it's not just about an incident here an incident there\nThere's a lot that's going into this and it's a lot that people are missing so you sit back and he's got you're not catching on because for whatever reason common sense is\nNo longer a part of politics now politicians run and now things are fought how things have talked about it it it's just gone\nGone\nSo you sit back and you go you know what it is what it is let it go let it happen we'll see what takes place Nancy Pelosi thinks she's got a one\nYear I think that I Will be the person was a gambling hand but I didn't have anybody for ... daughter it has to do just when they said [laughter] [noise] but I think that I have with my car\nAnd I think they're going to I think the Democrats will will pull out\nWon't be as big as they think a a victory when it comes to or the Congress but I think that the fight they have right now\nIsn't going to go that way they want in the Senate they have too many seats that they're they're trying to hold on to\nI think the main Sally in Arizona is starting to pull away from send them out which is one they thought they could have Heidi Heitkamp is dead in the water she says she's not voting for for Kavanaugh but she's twelve points behind and she's done they've got too many to defend and I don't think they're going to hold onto it the way they thought they thought it would\nThen soon as they asked them benefits that the Democrats had over the Republicans has evaporated since the mid September to this point in other words because of the cabinet hearing so the signal now and I trust the American people for exactly this reason\nThey saw what we saw they care about the constitution sodas Brett Kavanaugh and what they saw are a bunch of senators and other politician who do not\nKnow tell me Bruce read their semi Bruce right\nNot known as over conservative okay right she's run now that she's you get that not known as an Hoover conservative and she's right she's absolutely right you you know in sports they say it's getting hot at the right time and\nThis may be the right time and this may signal through a lot of people out there get out and vote in ways that didn't and no matter ... all of the other two that they were playing nothing appealed to anybody I don't like that song and I'm like that's all I thought we ... I like that\nAnd that's the thing they hit the right tune and they had nothing to do with it it was actually the Democrats who were the ones that are jumping up and exciting the right side of the aisle\nWe like the rule of law we care about fairness we don't want to be told that we're now guilty until proven innocent this has been rejected where they're announcing that in the polls Democrats were going to regret what they've done\nPossible three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter again a long time between now and election night [noise] it'll be interesting to see how this plays out and if there and here's the other thing that we're not talking about the Republicans could definitely fumbled is the rest of the way they could\nI think like I said I still think that the ... in Congress are going to hold it it's going to be fine and so they can pretend to we're going to the gym and then it's gonna go to the Senate dodged never going to happen and I think there is still that worry as well um\nThey're going to hold it it's going to be fine and so they can pretend to that we're going to the gym and then it's going to go to the Senate diets never going to happen\nAnd I think there is still that worry as well\nUh but at the same time I look at this and I still think there's just too much that they've got to fight right now and the Senate's watching them fight and do the things they've done I think Feinstein and some of the others have put some of the ones who were were in a in a dog fight who had a chance maybe to flip proceeded to hold the seat\nPut them in more peril\nBecause of the way that they acted because of how political this became and how people even on the left\nGo on and off I Believe him but what I Do know is I don't believe I like the way they handled things three two three five three twenty four twenty three at checkpoints and show is your Twitter sleep is mightily important\nTrust me I Know I

fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator\nThat the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's selling things to the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they become he's\nThat way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers in and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it a ... at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own the va to predict vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics\nAnd you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nThough is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred ... judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more lawyers they said you know\nDC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred ... judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitutional law there is\nNo such are no doubt on about ... they're talking about a passage\nFrom a yearbook you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans ... as a logical and beyond commonsense I respect them or if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about\nWhat these current feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed in if you're not believe than your anti woman or you're anti victim\nAnd justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop identifying ourselves as victims of this or victims of that because I they that's not going to help you advance as a person as being at a victim\nIt doesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is it raises every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then everyone is a victim\nOn even those who many who are that have been victims of sexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked\nIf you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really had nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to their while they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even gay or even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and his shoulders should not be\nShould not be shielding the entire me to live by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary of the me too movement but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein ... hearing today it was Harvey winds dean major democratic donor\nYou're not going to find him in a picture that Brett Kavanaugh you're gonna find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lot of lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful\nAnd very wealthy but let's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't mean the women describe and kind of not sending thirty six years ... years ago and song corroborated\nThis was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC or network that I literally don't even

tried to ... born\nPerjury getting people to change statements under pressure or even a other types of you know illegal activity are leaking information from the Senate to a reporter confidential information\nOr it looks like that happened and what how do we prevent this from happening again being in a defensive crouch or actually saying no no no no no we're actually going to tell them to preserve the records here [noise] any reaction\nLaura I'm I'm a I keep thinking about the uh I guess it's an old who songwriter if they if you let them do it to you got yourself to blame 'em ... by my to my mind\nWhat's happened here in part and only in part was directed personally at Kavanaugh ... my my take on it is that the overarching purpose of this\nIs the into roar um effect that it creates for conservatives and and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nA total line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you that if you try to crash your party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that\nIs to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that uh have to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean that's just not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president in the campaign but coming from a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself\nI really believe Trump sought the Republican how to fight I mean it's not going to simple formulation but for a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were all like in an elevator\nI mean it's not going to simple formulation but for a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were also like in an elevator and on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination there well I think\nHe's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes to the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means there's going to be accessed from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYeah [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election you don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it\nSo I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be ... up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to take it up because\nI I've seen you say this what are you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these Olin ski I direct action tactics and they say you know there's some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants who sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein who looks either liberal but she was fairly well respected until I think the last you know a couple\nOf years where she's been especially last year was she's really been pushed left I mean she because of course their primary challenge\nAnd the ... and the California has become more and more or less gone more or less and less left the country almost\n[noise] and yeah well now he's now a new person\n... you probably know this better than I Do but didn't California instituted some system\nHold on we just have breaking news Lisa Murkowski is voting no\nOn the Kavanaugh cloture vote so that means you know for the confirmation so that's one person or the Republicans have already lost a and Collins could be a yes but Murkowski is uh no I'm flake is a yes on the cloture vote a so that's a\nI don't know anything you want to say about that Andy before we go forward\nAs you I think pointed out the cloture vote just means we're going forward I'm ... and this is not over until it's over I mean I Know people\nThought that finally we had this buttoned up yesterday a business and there's been so many twists and turns to this and the other side is so rabbit about it this is not over until it's over\nAmy Coney Barrett Raymond a royal has said you better get the private jet and childcare ready for her [laughter] framing\nKeeps saying that Andy that's nine line and they just I Hope I Hope you mean there are some childcare in one way of laid out of Indiana are you going to need it\nYeah yeah Notre Dame right like the ... she needs double\nGo figure ... some childcare and that one way flight out of Indiana\nAre you going to need it yeah yeah Notre Dame the\nNeeds double time childcare right she's like I said but my mom at six she's got even more than that I\nThink I've got

you advise the White House what should be the next step here a blitzkrieg very quick nomination if someone else or should they or someone suggested doubled down on cabinet and ride it all the way to the midterms\nI ... I I Would have to ask a\nSorry again I'm Sorry and you hold that thought Joe mansion just voted yes for cloture then I think Joe Manchin the easiest Santa Cruz overlooking the boats yes go ahead sorry go ahead any\nYou know I Would just have to ask the smart political people is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there's not been I think you have to double down on Kavanaugh on say you\nKnow if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a a majority in the Senate or then we're going to nominate cat the cat and all over again you know turn it into an election issue but I don't know the politics of it well it up\nTo ... given you the big thumbs up when you said that the that you're thinking since the ... is a legal ... that you know he's a legal eagle he's always law you know constitutional law\nBut you you know you can be a political a political consultant if you want and actually be a good one handy because that's exactly it just like what they should have done with Obamacare Mitt Romney remember when he announced the Obamacare is a law passed\nIn twenty well Romney kind of just dropped it after he did his soapbox a thing on the at the hardware store like one of his eye sockets they just drive to take it out across the country and said it's going to destroy your health care and that would have been a great issue for him and he ended up this is a this is a great issue for the Republican\nYeah well I'm going to go from the who the Clint Eastwood and say a man's got to know is limitation [noise] um [laughter] I don't know that I'm the political guy or\nThat's all right so a mansion as he asked for cloture ending debate or so it was like Murkowski isn't no\nIt was just I don't talk about my ... this is why the whole family dynasty of senators has got the ... the idea that just because your father or your husband or your brother was a ... that suddenly you're ... you should be in the Senate I never liked this whole dynastic approach to\nIt you know to the Senate and the house of representatives I remember her father I mean and then she when she becomes a big liberal so I don't get\nThat at all I never I never understood that but you know like patently the indigenous people in Alaska are therefore Murkowski because she does throws a lot of money there was so they're they're all there for this or any McCarthy thank you so much for having on TV I'm very soon you're one of our favorite favorite go to gas and thinkers on all these issues will take a break\nA five five forty Laura boy were biting our nails hair this cloture vote\nIt ain't over until it's over anything can happy Amy Coney make sure you got that childcare ready because we you could you could be flown to Washington any moment don't go away\nThe Laura Ingraham show\nAre you paying too much for term life insurance there's a tremendous price war among the major term life companies rates have dropped dramatically in the past few years for example among men aged forty five non tobacco user one\nLife insurance there's a tremendous price war among the major term life companies rates have dropped dramatically in the past few years for example among men aged forty five non tobacco user\nOne million dollars of coverage Seventy five dollars per month level rate for the next ten years or a man age fifty non tobacco can obtain five hundred thousand dollars of coverage for a monthly premium of only one hundred ten dollars per month guaranteed not to change for the next Twenty years that's right\nLevel right guaranteed not to change but the next Twenty years\nIf you're a smoker we have great rates available for you as well as turned busters we specialize in politics a five hundred thousand dollars and above if you're looking for new or replacement term life insurance called today for a quote at one eight hundred five six nine fifty for forty that's one eight hundred five six nine fifty for", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "05"}
