adventure slash murder shows\nThat attract my wife watches all of these\nA dateline NBC murder mystery and those are horrors coverage and I'm like what is it about them because they're interesting I'm like why\nI say yeah nobody really understands how like serial killer brain works and I think everyone is just curious to try and figure out why don't you know an epithet really because we love

like a cousin to breast cancer awareness month both committed to women self care but the nineteenth of October set aside as a special day to encourage women to be proactive\nAnd to make an appointment to have your a memo griffey mammograms or heater early breast cancer detection early detection means early treatment the difference between life and death\nThere though a lot of controversy care about this man Margaret fees or how they are done the forces and really do is throw in the bud round yeah and they're also too late\nFor the most part if you've got that and by the time if using a memory of using MRI is different\nBut demography is that are done from what I understand I remember my ah my first and only wife died after suffering Twenty one years with stage four breast cancer and she had had a memo graffiti didn't find it and it was three or four months later she had pains in her back\nShe went to have it examined and then she had her breasts examining bingo\nBut this stuff had started when she had her first mammography so I'm not suggesting\nThat have done I mean it ends on whether the tumor start and as the rest of them so they they they usually start in the ... that doesn't mean that they have to yeah right yeah there are hey I had an MRI I'm\nA little uh one of those full body scans no doubt the doctor can and I had one of those full body scans you has the Hodgkin's lymphoma the two years later I had Hodgkin's lymphoma so I mean you know\n... so what but what happened when you went there when they see nothing nothing right yeah right anyway the history of mammography day goes back to Nineteen Thirteen when German doctor a German doctor detected breast cancer with X rays\nRobert and I'm Sorry Albert Solomon who is a surgeon in Berlin used an x-ray machine to see breast cancer in three thousand mastectomy samples back in Nineteen Thirteen\nThe X ray machine to see breast cancer in three thousand mastectomy samples back in Nineteen Thirteen\nFast forward in Nineteen fifty six radiologist in Houston improved a mammography imagery machine Robert Eden Houston based radiologist introduce specialized film for mammograms result in better imagery and detail\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy one zero mammoth griffey introduced for commercial use is zero mammoth graffiti was commercially introduced as a method of providing better quality images of the chest wall\nAnd then moving ahead to Nineteen eighty eight Congress approved mammography funding Congress passed legislation providing funding for yearly mammography screening is Medicare benefits\nAnd then uh in two thousand digital mammography was approved by the FDA as a um approved the first full field digital mammography system\nSo you're too young at what age care or women supposed to have their first mammogram I've forgotten although maybe it is\nNow I I don't I think starting it like forty five forty or forty five is when they start saying it it would be good to get them but I don't think you need to many cases\nOf breast cancer this start certainly before the forties\nBut I think generally so when you go to the gynecologist they also do a breast checkup when you're there and that they're ugly an annual thing so I think that's what gets you through until you're forty five when it was just men were of a risk\nExamining your your breast locally just feeling the\nSenate Democrat and around yeah there is no with hands it's not any kind of scan or anything like that\nIs that enough you comfortable with that\nI mean it's not the most comfortable experience\nBut I mean yeah you know there's two ways of the way up to ... to ... a ... is not comfortable and then somebody has got their hands over your breasts and there's there's nothing good that happens afterwards\nAnd I I mean I'm personally I think that they know what to feel for obviously I guess there could be something smaller that maybe they're not able to detect my family personally doesn't have a history of breast cancer so I'm not\nAt ... worried about it um knock on wood but uh yeah I mean I think for the most part they're able to detect that just with hands I mean there there have always been things to where you're supposed to kind of personally keep an eye on it and not just rely on the doctor you know your body that that does he feel\nSomething different that's when you kind of go and tell the doctor about it but I I think for the most part it works OK\nMhm interesting factoid on the ah you're talking about the X rays and the the the fifties in the history of all of it yeah yeah um\nWhat I found out when I went through\nThe Hodgkin's is that the Hodgkin's cancer cell is so weak\nThat they found out in the fifties that we're taking X rays of patience\nAnd Everytime they took an X ray the next X ray they would notice less cancer cells and they finally realized that the low level radiation people who had had Hodgkin's for people that had Hodgkin's yet at the low level radiation of the X ray was actually killing the cells really\nThat's how weak much ... or so no body should die from Hodgkin's non Hodgkin's on a little bit different deal because it spreads around the edges\nOf ours who fortunate that you didn't have any ...\nOr ... yeah nobody should die from Hodgkin's good for you listen to your body\nMy friend who the who is the state rep died in May of non Hodgkin's\nLymphoma fruit at a hunch\nMy friend who the who is the state rep died in May of non Hodgkin's\nLymphoma ... breads differently so it's tougher\nIt gets at ya it really does it takes its toll on everything\nThat's kind of a downer conversation but the idea is to remind you to get your mammogram ... and if you can yeah if you can get something more thorough\nIf you can afford an MRI\nAnd you say we can't do any more because we don't have any\nMoney to pay for but if you can I find MRI's are by far preferable than almost any circumstance to really getting to the root cause of whatever's going on inside of you so that's another angle and the third thing is don't give to the Susan G Komen Foundation\nAnd give to somebody else that are working on the problems of

somebody says you want to have that conversation is well I mean he couldn't get some of the stuff done if he wasn't on the personality than it is and that's probably true to a point what do you what did you\nStart because actually true I I Would love nothing more than Trump to become a where he sits behind the curtain\nFan and just holds the strings yeah and somebody like a Ryan sits up front and says all the nice things that we want to hear felt the reality is as much as I Can't stand it when he opens his mouth or picks up his Twitter then is that\nYou need to be that guy he does not care what you think of him now that he is going to do what he wants to do and he doesn't care what his highest assistance say and he doesn't care what the ... as enemies say he doesn't care what the media says I'm going to do what I Want to do and that's what it takes to get some of this stuff done\nAnd the reality is you can't have your kid look up to this guy and be a hero\nOr because he's got to say

B. program latest toys and bikes and that sort of thing oh my God we're talking about this are already trained by using accomplished in her late of a lifestyle journalist\nCommentator specializing in smart shopping ... personal finance shoving parenting that sort of thing so let's get to the best buys here a tray here to discuss the toys view feels strange talking about this stuff\nThis earlier you okay with that\nThe toys do you feel strange talking about this this earlier you okay with that\nI'm okay with that because I think about holiday all year long this is my big busy season and yeah so I've been thinking about this for a month though I'm really excited to actually be talking about it\nAll right so let's talk about some of the things I I ... did you have this coupon some of the right on toys and the reason I start with that is because I actually have I have a a four year old Rubio Christmas four year old grandson\nHas I'm a farmer I was trying to find him a ride on tractor\nThat was a self powered and they can't find one I could find cars for a couple of hundred bucks and that are a self powered is that I use the first time I ever maybe because I'm looking for him but if they've been around for awhile trainer they knew\nYeah well you know they've been around for a while but they improve\nEvery year and so huffy has one that's the are the monster truck which might be fun for you and because it's the perfect size for your grandson\nIs a two one toy too because it's a ride on toy but also transitions really easily to a radio controlled vehicle just by pulling up the steering wheel\nAnd so it's a lot of fun to play with him so much play value and it goes forward and backwards and so there's so\nMuch fun to be had with that one and then there's another one more for the girls there's the Disney Princess ... horse and carriage which has a lot of play value to if she's got storage for her toys and an area to put her drink and not one goes forward and backward and then if you're looking for that classic bike\nHuffy has an easy build bike that is what comes out of the box that takes just a minute to put it together it's so easy and it's easy to grow with your child very easy to adjust and assemble and comes in all different styles inside the so in terms of ride on toys and toys with wheels\nI think these toys from hot they're going to be really hot this holiday season\nWas horse power on that ... monster truck for monster truck is\nTwelve or has a twelve volt battery and a good point five miles per hour when you're riding on and then five miles per hour when you're using the radio control\nAnd they don't make a big enough for your regime but\nThey're going to bring you unfortunately you're granted I'm sure\nSo I'm huffy it's interesting I haven't heard about the huffy ran for a long time I used to have a huffy by my daughter I'm a nice to see or hear that there are ... that I didn't go anywhere but there as prominent as they are no tree\nOh they really are I mean they've been around for a hundred and twenty five years and ... is fun and ... and the liability and quality and what's great about these toys that I'm Talking about is that\nYou have that big exciting box under the tree a child opens it and it takes just minutes to get that toy up and running for your child and all\nThis the battery operated toys they come with a charge of all battery so it's not like you're scrambling around looking for the right battery and replacing them when they run out a little plug that right back in and recharge and then your child can get right back into\nThe file Lulu your sister because we tell you something [laughter] you ... are you doing this where you're under the tree with together a decent and goes ever present an orange ... would you have to wait for the battery to charge them all when we take six more hours yeah All right\nAnd that's what I recommend for ... for parents is easing use no hassle so finding a toy that you can get the kids up and running and playing really quickly and like you said not spending the whole night before assembling that toy are doing it while your child sitting there saying is my toy ready yet I really like these for that either\nLike you said not spending the whole night before assembling that toy are doing it while you're sitting there saying it's my toy ready yet right I really like aids or that you have you\nWhat are the costs of some of these what price points do we have now you're going to make these more attractive trait\nAre the monster truck in Ninety nine dollars because of the killing one toy it is a great value and that's something else that I like about how the tail it because they are affordable but also so while belt\nSo the uh the the question and that's always the question pregnant for me you buy these things you put them together and they go out and the driveway and then five minutes they're broken and you can't find the parts to fix them and there's just so\nThe thrill of opening the package and getting excited about using it quickly the luster has lost because this stuff is junk\nWho have the time to search endlessly for
