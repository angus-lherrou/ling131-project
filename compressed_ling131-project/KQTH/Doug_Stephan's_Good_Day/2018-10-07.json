E. they've got football they got cheerleaders cheerleaders they got lockers man if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that\nHave it on one that fall thanks for taking my call sure what's up so I didn't hear that go I resigned our children I trust Florida prepaid college planned and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and defense than our income has gone down and we added another child\nAnd we've gotten into San credit card debt and they have a car loan now um\nWe can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without the chilly here that are suddenly got half our debt and leave that money and continue contributing to their pre paid plan how much is in there\nUm about any six hundred eighty six\nWe have a cabin in what do you own your credit cards off by that\nTime and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nMe just ask you and that's and I realized when you get that and he got out of order like having a pan ... pan and then I don't know like a good point gotcha okay [noise] um and your household income as well [noise]\nUm has been explained five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency\nA no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of their enroll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an e essay and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you're prepay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I\nPrepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving you a growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent inflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time minded\nAnd so on you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run\nAnd they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration with a\nWith the stability of the fun of still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your ID six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget crank your lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for ... for a a help us going\nHere's we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because\nThis is a wonderful thing that's fixing the happened or we were my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom [laughter] and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole and there's only a boom if after it's not a\nDry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and then that's the only reason west Texas is struggling or on our oil prices are so far down that\nThere's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom baby I mean\nBut uh and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell although it all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's essentially\nA they're looking at the three million for all\nThe and or or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you're just added on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling house\nWe're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business as if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable in less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars by the middle of kitchen table would I go go by our rights and west Texas where that is the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die ... and\n... and that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash yeah well it might but I got to tell you start getting less rock\nMarkets less risk than drilling holes yeah we uh hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all persons to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father make a decision\nOh I see so is it just yeah they can make that\nYeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five\nPercent of it\nI probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death so phone ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and a ... you know so that that you know struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not some advisors set of families entire portfolio three million dollar network\nTo be tied up in ... [noise] um\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me [noise] as a financial coach should they do that I Would say no [noise] I Would\nSo I I Would take the majority or\nMoney off the tides thanks for calling into [noise] the news to have a blessing like that do you think\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\n\n\nWhat are we going to change the [noise]\nHi Michelle France and Kavanaugh\nSworn in as Supreme Court justice last night it followed a showdown on the Senate floor with protesters shout him from the gallery as vice president and the final voting process the gallery\nProtestors taking to the streets outside the capital and Supreme Court following the confirmation vote for at least say they made more than one hundred and fifty Iraq [noise]\nMeantime President Trump before leaving for a rally in Kansas celebrated the confirmation\nJuly congratulations there was [noise]\nWell I mean who would've thought of something like that could have happened and what he's been through\nNow the justice Brett Kavanaugh has been sworn in what are some of the cases that the justices may take up the Supreme\nCourt has about forty open cases currently some of those have already been heard but looking ahead there are some key cases already on tap\nOne of the most watch will likely be gamble United States a case concerning double jeopardy and whether the court should do away with these separate sovereign exception\nI mean someone could be tried for the same crime in different solver and for example being tried for the same crime in federal court in separately in state court the question being whether that violates the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy protection marker I'm alarmed ABC new\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo calling his meeting with Kim Jong in North Korea promising [noise]\nTom hale making his remarks after landing in Seoul South Korea in Haiti a major earthquake is rocky island ABC's general access Afghanistan has more from the foreign\nDebt point nine earthquake struck Saturday Night there are eleven so far the Haitian authorities say several homes and the hospital where severely damaged\nMeanwhile disaster workers in Indonesia stay the death toll from last week's earthquake and tsunami has jumped now more than Seventeen hundred people\nSounds and people are still missing you're listening to ...\nHave you ever thought about saying goodbye to your job just walking into your Boston saying I quit and how would you like to commute to work without ever leaving your home\nWell not long ago at thirty nine year old entrepreneur from a billionaire family spent twenty million dollars in three years to find the best home based business in North America he researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had a real long term potential he bought it\nAnd right now he's looking for people to help him turn this company into his next billion dollar success story\nSo if you're serious about making money from home without having to leave your home will grab a pen because I'm about to give you the address of a website where you can learn all about this unique in rare opportunity write this down WWW dot go here next dot com now get on your computer and go to this site now\nPart time or fulltime your income is based totally on your performance interested go here next dot com\nAnd say goodbye to your boss tomorrow go here next dot com\nIndustry it's Chris plants show morning\nThis is real or not NATO or not and they can spirit the toll lie to us live long lives soul laugh out loud ...\nThat's Al Gore under mob play I'm also fly product or do you have to walk away or do you have to use ... toilet paper like they do in Venezuela now [laughter] Superstorm Sandy that's a superstorm and it never happened before\nOur predicted it it's just like a predicted there was a storm [laughter]\nI said that would be a stall vendor Superstorm Sandy block a profit a prophet of do Mr Mann\nIn London there was an attack using a car with are\nNo more cars and then there are no more attacks as you can plainly said Christ\nPlans ... four one K.

call Dave sure how can I help\nI have a question are we are my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to\nAh we've got about Ninety thousand in that and we currently have a three vehicles two of them\nAre mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a\nA commuter car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to call a trailer [noise] her car she owes about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise] um but we just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because it's ... percent of\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay all the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars were\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors and them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that though show or good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand\nGood and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay but that that includes the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes yes and um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just at all so I mean we're not going to keep the dad\nFive to two men we'll talk about your life and\nYour money Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college when my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash uh-huh um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on so I have no equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him in and out\nPicking out some grow stock mutual fund to see where it goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my what do I get this kind of pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep\nLiving expenses for for um\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um\nSo I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then I Want to know what to do with the rat shake shack draw towards my how we all know that every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm [laughter] and that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so at twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah\nYeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks\nInto it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well I'll tell you that\nMandatory okay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I published it would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay\nAnd that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the the elbow and high hundred for me I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of them are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time in her life so that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but\nWhat I Would do just go to smart faster Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business so I don't care what you do okay I had an effect my income at all\nBut I people always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred as eleven thousand and that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that\nI'm a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I'd just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that and that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in ... in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent\nAbove that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find in my budget almost keep junk and on that house you're probably going to that house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you doubts are better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand that a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty abnormal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been a just an old from a service academy or three years ago\nUm and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand of reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount can fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um and I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWhile so you learn to you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to untie thirty thousand bucks this thing or if it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're gonna get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask the surf through and lip service or you're assigned to\nThe recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and has forgiven\nYes or however my case I was not on board\nWill discharge half to pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in the short story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that\nMoney when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you\nKnow of of her check because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind the rest\nOf my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of initially\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that be perpetual but to do that that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like going to see last time not because she was healthy but because she was on a healthy yeah\nAnd I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but I Do see if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nOur now she only did he medicated she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they add controlled or she definitely has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as semi really mentally ill and she is voices if she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nWell her ... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nAnd it happens to people all the time so what does she say right now when they call her on ... so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you're just you know 'cause they're going to just I don't think\nI should be talking she should be telling them I'd\nBe either one of the I'm not going to long conversation it's got nothing you get nothing because all they're gonna badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating in trying to work our way through the death right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and\nI aren't going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're going aren't\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not given or any no so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nMonths from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the ...\nAnd give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say any show a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight and get their hey look at and we work at a deal yeah or you know they\nGot Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and work and again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in full\nWill do it and get an N. riding and no electronic access to your checking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a filthy industry so you got to treat them like rattlesnakes because they are [noise] you gotta really tender covering person here who's going into\nAfter she starts making some money you got to walk with her emotionally on that you can you can give her the cheerleading support machine age without giving them money and I think you're right to do all of that there's good news show she could make it out if she makes a good choice

show\nDay thank you so much for taking my call sure a lot that's literally my\nMy my question is\nIs my dad is Seventy five years old still works He works in a steel plant makes about four fifty to six fifty a week um about couple\nOf years ago he got sick I found out that he had ... hey he's behind\nOn a lot of his bills had a somehow ... that in a fifty thousand dollar loan from the bank\nAnd ah he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and Social Security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I Do provide him so I took over all the bills and I do provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card\nThat for him to buy food and what are you doing with the rest of the gas [laughter] I'm Sorry what are you doing what the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all on paying all his bill the sale has about um Fifteen K left on the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge [noise] I'm putting everything was a turning out to do everything on on that that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\n\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nOn the car eight and a half inch you on a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done in a year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right your ankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in the steel plant that I understand that right\nI was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I am a traitor yeah my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way you that free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything you can probably make it on a Social Security if he had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh\nThen the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that and then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency fund in place\nAnd is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good well I'm asking is why a bank loan and [noise] um someone that have H. B. K. and uh you know four and a and it could be paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right well that's yeah\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral is part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody does worry that are not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ...\nAnd so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered the dog that credit card\nSo I mean dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything he doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card offers it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing today I got to require retirement okay\nI'm going to hear about a year ... and a ... century I don't have a four week Kay all\nPretty good mhm I quickly there are at fifty two would be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it does it take before we have for the whole entire movie or\nCan run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of ...\nFor the whole time and they\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to say if you're white from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking out their four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh\nDefinitely yeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety according to the stat tables right now\nAnd so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire Hi Todd how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nWell um I I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask you a question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dreamer I guess for a free spirit as you would say from listening to your show addict now for the last two weeks [laughter]\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money she used to save or um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd I'm five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside the shaving she wants to say more than that but [noise] she I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um we paid off to credit cards\nAnd we paid off on the credit card my question is is\nDoing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me is about down the road is my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got\nAbout ... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over ... in there\nYes it is I started to read that I have\nRead a total makeover has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids\nAnd so it's going to walk you through first thing you do you save a thousand dollars you get on a written plan you and your wife are in agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan to gather okay and want you to do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say that that was in dollars if you've already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except your home by listening to death smallest laws you attack those was caused by getting rid of those that famous and now you've got the ability to invest\nEverything except your home

your life better\nHappier live your life happier and more productive what about retirement or their Ten Commandments that will help you live your retirement or your ideal retirement life better we think there are there the core principles retirement we can also call them the ten commandments retirement that's what we're going to cover today on ditch your money\nI'm Jeff voting your host president a premier retirement planning of wealth management with my co host of Linda ... good morning\nHey good morning happy ... a weekend happy weekend man tapped her very long week long are you going to tell everybody where we have combo as I said it may have a great bus tickets\nAnd happy weekend man after\nVery long week\nLong are you going to tell everybody where we\nHave ... as I say I may have a great bust textile 'em out to have a four week for an hour an hour and a again\nAnd we actually tried not to talk about business for a whole week than we\nAre the fact that we didn't have Internet kind of help that\nWell yeah some of his did but anyway it was a it was a good time we're back and are ready to hit the ground running with the ten commandments\nCore principles that retirement now you know the the ticket the ten commandments are mostly if you think about um there's a ... not now ... what Dow shalt not this not don't kill don't committed guidelines ... whatever but there's also a few thou shalt like honor they father you know and then my other and you know um\nHave no other ... you know put God first and there's a lot of things that we've got to put first when it comes to retirement as well like how 'bout now shall not run out of money [laughter] right that's a good one and how about the about shout out shout enjoy your retirement by planning in advance rather than\nA Bob and weave in in ... acting wants to retirement plan starts so\nAnd no matter what you call them they're important is your ideal life or to craft your ideal life or in retirement\nAnd and again you know without knowing these cameras from knowing the core principles in advance is kind of hard to plan planning is a well it's a pre event\nA process is not a oh hey I just bumped up against this a challenge now what do I do that is a reactive way to planet unfortunately so many people get to retirement they think they\nGet to that ripe old age of sixty five or sixty six when you can start taking getting your Medicare insurance covered and then you can get your Social Security turned on and you might get a pension or you might just happen to see how much is in the four oh one K. whether you've hit that magic number that you've been looking for are not all of a sudden now it's like OK I'm here now what I'm\nRunning for most part we as human beings we don't like the plan and it can be very tedious at times so we like you just get in and do it\nRight and I think what people do when they don't plan as they come up to that point where all of a sudden now we've got this uh position and we and we see this all the time in our office people come in and say oh here's my plan tell me how much I can live on and that kind of goes with the first court principal is\nHave an idea of what you want to live on in retirement if you're used to living on let's just use around number let's just say a hundred thousand dollars a year because that's what you're making in your working life\nAnd if you're spending all but maybe\nA certain percentage of that because you're putting some away are paying taxes that you might not have to pay later or that you can have I mean isn't that still the same lifestyle that you'd want to continue living in retirement why do planners are some people some companies retirement plan and companies say well you should plan to live on Seventy percent of whatever you're living on now during your working life\nI've had that why you're cute and plan to maintain your lifestyle\nYeah why not live on a hundred percent of it or in some cases it's kind of an irrelevant number because\nFor some people if they're barely eking by they can't live on even Ninety nine percent of\nWhat they're used to living on if they really need that hundred percent and then there's other people that are making a ton of money way more than they need well I mean what's relative to a ton of money or else have a question about that just say they make twice what they need to live on well they can maybe live on fifty percent but if they what you need to find out is what you're living on\nAnd you want to create a lifestyle if you can to maintain that lifestyle in fact\nSome people want to increase it a little bit and so to plan I think that one of the biggest Dow shouts is to determine\nWhat is going to cost to live that ideal retirement life\nAt least and then in his eye or to maintain what you're used to now\nIn what is going to cost to live that ideal retirement life\nWell at least and then part of that in his eye or to maintain what you're used to now granted but that being said\nSpending habits when you have that income coming in spending habits can be very difficult to change so making sure that you know what your budget is going to be in retirement versus\nUm what it is when you're working and some of the the research that we've done so that some people spend a little bit more like you said some people spend a little bit less\nBut one of the um study shows that when you first get into retirement you are going to spend a little bit more money on travel\nHealth care pre retirement about eight percent of your budget after retirement about Nineteen percent utilities is one that I kind of shocked me that utilities are going to go out yeah you stay home or staying home or especially Arizona What are you doing you're cranking that air conditioned\nThe contact that was in this probate system ever got out of probate so I Know probate takes a long time it costs a lot of money and\nIt was frustrating the other thing was is sometimes these assets were tied up that they are tied up in the court there's nobody in their making trades if the market gets ugly you're waiting for this asset this this account that is totally\nMarket controlled up and down with the market while you're waiting for probate to release it to you for how many years I mean I was waiting for years on some cases so again you don't want to have your money out of your control so you want to set it up to where those accounts are in your control\nBut I like and you know since I've had to deal with medical issues and I like having my team all underneath one with when I went and my cancer instead of when I first started I had it at GI guy over here I had my surgeon over there I had my medical on colleges to over there\nWhen I finally found a place that they all talk together they all sat around a table than my health was better served my life is better served by having it all underneath one move and everybody talking together\nExactly and that's and that's how I think it should work especially with the estate by now if they plan can be ugly um there's a lot of assets that are really easy to pass without probate ... those are the things that you can put a direct successor or a beneficiary on\nAnd the cool thing that some people think that the the difference between an estate plan is whether you have a we'll which by the way it goes through probate don't let your lawyer make it think that because they do a will for you you don't have to go through probate it just means that the lawyer who drafted if where you'll probably is going to get a call when you die and they're going to deal with appropriate process for you\nAnd of course we know and not to be smart the legal profession they do a good job in what they do but remember they do work by the hour not by how fast they can get a job done and sometimes I don't think there's a real incentive to get this thing done they want to be thorough and those hours up at hundreds of dollars per hour\nAnd that's why probate can be very costly time consuming and frustrating for many families you can also use a trust a living trust will get you out of that probate process\nIs just like putting all your assets into an entity and when you die your trust just gets a new trust of your new boss and so you're stuffed just becomes managed by a new\nManager so that's an easy way to bypass probate but but it doesn't cost a little bit of money is set up and there is a management issues but there are simpler ways and even that to do it right now and\nYeah there are some financial instruments out there like India that he's and life insurance that those amyloid probate they go directly to the beneficiary\nLong as you have a named beneficiary that as a legal entity like a person an individual or an entity some I I've seen some insurance policies people will come in and say the ... and I'll see the beneficiary doesn't nation as as a state of if you're a beneficiary says anything like a state of\nYou are going through part of it because it because that has to be proved who you're a state is\nThe other thing that you can do is direct succession not just on those particular products but keep all my IRAs Roth IRAs also have been a fishery designations where you can designate a spouse and children to receive it directly without probate and in Arizona and a few other states they now have\nWhat's called a beneficiary deed where you can actually put property you're home\nA real estate on a beneficiary deed that shows that as soon as whoever's named on that Dede can produce a death certificate and your name in other words you're gone they now own that property it can be put in their name they don't control of it\nSo there are direct succession plans that you can use in conjunction with\nYour financial plan and most of the time unfortunately when you go to the big box brokerage houses and things they go oh we don't do estate planning you know go to somebody else will where do you go if you don't know these\nAnd most of the time unfortunately when you go to the big box brokerage houses and things they go oh we don't do estate planning you know go to somebody else will ... where do you go if you don't know these things [laughter] so that's what I Would get\nWell the number four commandment is non financial decisions can and will affect your financial decision\nAnd sometimes that doesn't seem like it would that are you going to move are you going to travel um I had taken the grandchild all of those had impacts and when you're making non financial decisions\nI think one step further on how that can impact\nYour financial situation taking in a kid can cost be very costly\n... well it is and we've had that happen and that's just one example of many but I just keep them in ... to ... or just to to reiterate that in and it was just simply is\nYour ideal retirement life is your life is not

... protect what you have more a lifetime to achieve now back to his your money [noise]\nPage at at that time again for your kid that we [noise] yes it is and the tip of the week this time is going to be\nOut about all the R. M. D. mistakes you need to avoid our MDs are called ... choir minimum distributions\nThey apply to your qualified accounts when the IRS forces you to take money out of those IRA accounts or those retirement accounts at the ripe old age of seven and a half now that's not always the case but it's just kind of assumed that case\nI'm going to go through some of the um I guess the misconceptions and the mystery behind our MDs and some of the mistakes that you might want to avoid so\nPay attention here and get some good\nGet some good scoop All right so what about taking your are MDs at the wrong time\nI'm the first time you were required to take a minimum distribution from a qualified account or a a an IRA let's just say four one K. is at age seven and a half and that assumes you're not working if you're still working you can actually keep their four O. one K. money are working for you and not have to take that are empty but if it's in an IRA\nYou have to take out slightly under four percent of that money at age seven and a half now the first time you've taken are empty out you don't have to take it out the year you turned Seventy and a half you have to take it out by April\nFifteenth the ... the time you file for your taxes after that year and some people take well great I'm not going to take that money out now I'm going to wait 'til April well guess what you just did you just forced herself to take out to our MDs and the same tax year\nWell great I'm not going to take that money out now I'm going to wait 'til April well guess what you just did you just forced herself to take out to our MDs and the same tax year that may in fact force you into a higher tax bracket\nUm or at least keep that second are empty at that higher tax bracket when in fact if you split those are MDs up and took him in the correct year\nThen maybe you would have maintained a little lower taxable\nAmount on those required minimum distribution so be sure you do the math before you just assume that a smart to put off paying taxes I Know the the pay a lot of time says hey we'll put up paying taxes because it makes them look good that you're that they file your taxes but they're not going to look good in the future if you end up having a double dip on those are MDs or next year\nNow on the contrary if you know that you could be in the same tax bracket whether you take that are him deep\nOr not if it doesn't make a difference then maybe there is no problem in waiting but make sure you know what the cost is going to be before you make that decision [noise]\nSo I'm not realizing the extra costs of delaying that first are MD is probably going to be you know top of the list when you first start here's another problem with our MDs if you take it at the wrong time or you forget to take it or you don't take it\nThe penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution or\nThe proper amount of distribution is a fifty percent tax penalty now I've heard on another talk radio show somebody says is it true you have to take a fifty percent penalty and this well known financial guru says no that can't be true it could never do it is true I hate to tell you [noise]\nUnbeknownst to even other financial professionals that you might hear on the radio that penalty can be stiff [noise]\nNow the other thing about arm the withdrawals is the amount based is based on your total\nQualified accounts or the total amounts that you have an all your accounts but it does not require you to take the are empty from each specific account and eat in the same proportion\nYou can actually take all of your are MDs out of one account as long as the total amount of our um the withdrawals and the amount you pay on those withdrawals is the right amount to cover all of those retirement accounts\nNow you can't now they you you can't mix and match between spouses they have to be your own for your own IRAs and so you but if you have several different IRA accounts you can uh um [noise] just find that the total amount you have to pay now the amount you have to pay is also based on December thirty first value of those\nQualify to counts\nAs of December thirty first the prior year and you have to take the required minimum distribution out by December thirty first the following year so you may actually be able to allow that account to grow for a year and be able to have some growth and then take the required minimum distribution out later\nSo what about some number seven and that is the commandments are we done with them or six I think it would have had a good then we\nCan talk about annuities and all of that other stuff but that's another show that\nYeah we we've done that before I mean to create income is a reliability of income come your Social Security or pensions a guaranteed annuities or even the ... the life insurance retirement plans have guarantees\nOf income guarantees as well so there are ways to guarantee and get your income level up to whatever it needs to be and then well of course a lot of that depends on your savings and whether or not you're responsible and I won't call lucky I think it's really just that you plan to well that you work hard planned well live within your means you'll be able to continue to do that retirement so\nShould you continue to save in retirement is that another ... commandment is\nThat I Believe so if you have that opportunity and if you are living below what you're making in all of your retirement accounts and definitely I Would say started another account that's there for emergencies are just so that you can keep up with your ... well\nI think a lot of times we we think there might we kind of plan for inflation I think the um [noise]\nUh the inflation will probably be offset by us as we get older spending a little bit less nevertheless some of the costs that happened when we're older are can be extreme like the nursing homes like the uh um care that might not be covered\nOr the experimental care that might not be covered with your Medicare plan you may have to go to Mayo Clinic for what's called experimental treatments which aren't covered you may need of a chunk of money set aside for that big rainy day expense and it isn't if you don't need every penny to live on it's a it's smart to try to save and maybe even accumulate a little bit for the future if you can now\nPending in a savings account or leverage it to make more money so am I life insurance looks like we\nFor the future if you can now pending in a savings account or leverage it to make more money so am I life insurance\nLooks like we covered the three more we've got three more to go on the commandments let's talk about those are our last segment but before we go let's ah I'm\nReminded if you want a retirement radius review to see if you've got those five points taken care of adequately that they dumped tail together that comprehensive plan is in place\nAnd that you have the capacity to retire if you're planning on retiring soon or the next five or ten years even as better to start early than to start late and if you're already retired uh let's make sure that we don't have any gaps and that we can help you feel those gaps if need be\nCalled five to ... to one Seventy five sixty sixty get\nComplimentary fun visit with us by reading his review that's why she loved to one
