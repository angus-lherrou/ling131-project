E. N. C. E. R. S. C. N. S. E. more months they'll S. E. N. S. E. and does it make dollars and cents C. E. N. T. S.\nTo pay the taxes they get it over with and put it some place where it will grow\nAnd you can access it tax free and none of it shows up on your ten forty four\nWe have talked about this but very few people here as my contention\nVery few people think that what I'm Talking about today is going to happen they go you know what mark I haven't seen it we've been hearing about this the ah the Congress keeps kicking the can down the road you know what this really isn't going to happen folks how much longer do you think\nWe can go on printing money\nIn golf they call it um all again when you you take a shot and then you know you hit it and it was a rough or he hid it in the water well we're going to give you a mole again we're going to allow you to take another shot at it well that's what really Trump is done by giving us these lower tax rates and postponing some of this stuff down the road until until maybe another\nGroup of people get in and they say we need to ... raise the rates again we need to really tighten our belts but you know what it's not polluted politically expedient for people to do this it doesn't gain them favor with with their constituency so\nWhat do you do as an individual well number one you're doing\nA really good thing today listening to this show number two you can pick up the phone and give us a call and say mark you've talked about this and ... what do I do we're going to get into the heart meat and potatoes of this thing here a little bit certainly in a second portion of our show give us a call two nine six four four six four go onto the Web\nAsked for\nPacket that we've been given out for months and months and months because it's so important that it it contains all the information that you want to know about\nRight it all the different articles markets that that part of the pack it is called the optimize their packet I keep adding articles and articles more articles are going into it that support and substantiate where we are going as a nation\nWe are headed folks towards what's called a ... a sovereign debt crisis this fiscal gap\nIn and and I read this article and the gentleman is saying look we are headed towards insolvency ... is that not sobering or what\nIf we are headed towards insolvency it means to re boot we're going to have to change everything that we do we're going to have to dramatically increase taxes that's why I say if you\nAnd we're going to have to change everything that we do we're going to have to dramatically increase taxes that's why I say if you can pay the tax today and get it over with\nI eat\nAnd then where do I put the money trust in where do people put the money if they pay the tax and they get it over with\nHe's thinking about their wallets and then what do they do with it what vehicle might they put in and\nTake a really hard stand yes and this thing I'm going to guess when through life insurance very young that that could be one of the vehicles or into a Roth IRA certainly anything where you can pay the tax get it over with and then all the gross that's that's in those vehicles is all yours if you stop and you think about\nIs it possible that all going to go out on a limb here that it's it has been immoral for advisors to tell people to put money into four one K. plans and for all three B plans and IRAs and so forth why\nIs because it's not\nIt's a different role but really the word that makes the most sense is it is a postponement they are asking you to postpone paying the tax when you are and historically low rates\nTo a time when you are probably going to be in the highest tax bracket ever for you and your family does that make sense I\nHad this conversation the other day and I can't even believe were\nLess than three minutes we got to take a a little break here in the show but think about a four one K. plan where the government is saying you can\nTake a deep Dutch and today on your contribution and oh by the way you're going to be taking on all the risk of that money market jumps market ... you know plummets you're going to yes you get the game but you also but there's little catty out to that but you're also going to take me taking on all the risk if that market plummets\nYou the listener the one that has that for one that for all three be that simple IRA that set plan you're taking on all the risk but then when you get out to retirement look at all the potential growth fats in that account the government is saying\nThank you for taking on all that risk but now we want to share and all that gain\nFolks is that fair you've taken on all the risk now they're asking you to share in\nWhat you did that roller coaster ride and hopefully that account as gain some money they're now saying they want to participate in that\nIs that fair I don't think it is so let's step back what have you paid the tax\nThey you got it over with you said look\nMark I agree I I Believe what you're saying is true I Am going to take that money today pay the tax on it and I'm going to put it into something like a whole life insurance policy or I'm going to put it into a Roth or some type and then all of that game\nAll of that\nYours none of that declare rubble\nThere is no longer a postponement you've taken on that risk today by paying the tax which there's very little risk if we are technically in a in a bracket that is going to be the lowest of your lifetime but all of that gain all that growth the government is not going to participate in\nIts all yours ooh let's rub our hands together yet all mine it's all mine look at what exactly see that's what the government hasn't told you it's a postponement\nAnd they are having you postpone that money to a point in time where they're going to need it desperately probably the most desperate they've ever been because of where we're going this thing we call a fiscal cliff folks it's common you know the biggest threat to our next\nThey probably the most desperate they've ever been because of where we're going this thing we call a fiscal cliff folks it's common you know the biggest threat to our national security\nIs not the borders it's our national debt think about that for a second the biggest threat to our national security is our national debt\nIf that's not sobering if that doesn't Silvio if you're not thinking oh my goodness mark\nWhat do I do well you call us let\nUs help you get on the right track two nine six four four six for my cell two three five nine for six five trust and I can't believe the first portion of the show is over you didn't want to stay tuned for the next portion of our show because this is where we really dialing out what you can do because the math done\nWould be three point four trillion dollars where are we going to come up with that money if everybody is oh we you know health care free for all the let's wipe away all the student debt let's do this let's do that well\nLook folks the current budget of the U.S government is currently around four point two trillion dollars that's the current budget so what's the deficit\nThe deficit is we're not bringing it we're bringing in a million less than a trillion I'm Sorry we are bringing in a trillion less than that\nMedicare for all would be estimate is it costs three point six trillion dollars you know a little bad here a little ... billion here a billionaire a trillion here now you're starting argue starting to talk about some real money\nIf you throw in Social Security defense interest on the debt and pensions at all levels of government the cost is now over ten trillion dollars look the gross domestic product of our country is only twenty trillion\nMathematically all the numbers I just read would destroy our economy so what does all this what does this mean for you the individual if all those numbers are just like gobbledygook and you're thinking what in the world is this even mean it means let's talk about you and your family\nWhat\nCan we do to help you and your family I Would like to say here's a solution to the economy to our country as a whole that would mean probably getting rid of all of Congress and getting economists in there who really know what's going on we know that's not going to happen so what can you do here in Tucson\nArizona in southern Arizona what can you can pick up the phone you can call she'd say mark you're talking a lot about this stuff what can I conceivably\nDo today ... is it and we're not talking about this I Hope today can I even take advantage of bad stuff when that happens when the markets plummet\nYes you can take advantage of that ... what we can talk about this maybe not today I'm going to maybe touched on it but definitely next week\nSo folks the Social Security Medicare programs are currently running negative cash flow numbers that means that we are paying out more benefits than they are receiving in revenue\nYou know we've heard this time and time again the problem is everybody is super busy we are all running at a million miles\nAn hour we get our information in Fifteen second news bites right little things here little things there we don't hear the whole story we're going well that oh wow that look at the look of the market some who look at how\nFolks as Paul Harvey used to say do you want to know the rest of the story don't you really want to know what's going on\nIf today at the end of the show you simply remember what mark said about ... ... low tax rates historically low tax rates maybe I Need to start thinking about paying the tax today and putting\nTime on your side folks Tyne is not on your side when you are postponing a tax liability that's on the side of the government that's not on your side yet most of us unfortunately have bought off hook line and sinker into\nPutting money into for a one case for all three bees\nTraditional i._r._a. set simple we have been taught that\nBy Wall Street our government has said hey we will give you a deep Dutch in today and you can differ that no you can't postpone\nWhat is inevitable it's inevitable that you're going I Believe it's inevitable you're going to be at a higher tax rate when you get into retirement\nIt's inevitable that you're going I Believe it's inevitable you're going to be at a higher tax rate when you get into retirement do you want to even take that chance I Would think I Would hope you would say no\nSo as I said earlier I Believe it's even deceptive\nFor many advisors and look if I have somebody comes in and they are adamant about the mark I want to set up a four one on a set up an IRA look I'm not going to argue with him but I give them\nThe hard and cold fact so where do you put the money first and imagine if you pay the tax today where can you put the money to wear all grows free of income tax\nDown the road think about it just really hard for a second I you're smiling so I kind of think you kinda sorta no\nTake a look at the ... you're shaking your head say have you not been listening to the show every week that I did\nThat I Do it for the trust and come on now work with me here it's gotta be some sort of policy it don't kind of policy I don't know what do you mean you don't know man you ride again a life insurance policy that's where you should be putting it why because of all the advantages look\nIdle folks I don't want you to die that's not why we're buying this thing we want you to live we want you to enjoy all the living benefits I had a a good outcome in a last week and she was she was very concerned about some monies that she had seen a creditor and predator\nProtected who isn't that interesting you like that\nCreditor imprinted are protected that's what life insurance is the cash valleys any good whole life insurance policy are creditor and predator\nProtected they help you\nWhen it comes to long term care they help you when it comes to critical illness they help you when it comes to maybe having to pull somebody out to keep your business afloat or to pay that bill that unexpected medical bill where is the money\nGoing to come from your life insurance policy and again\nWhen the real crash finally hits and I believe that's coming I Believe this suit nominee is coming and think about it when when the crash finally hits and everybody wants to get out of all their stocks and bonds and their mutual funds in their ... and real estate and all their commodities\nWhere we'll where will they get the money for the all these redemption Z\nWherever this money is held where are those folks going to get the money\nWho's going to buy all of these assets when everybody wants to sell them\nThere's not necessarily going to be a market for them life insurance on the other end has always been liquid during all the economic disasters that have ever been around\nI think about that you the listener have an ability to take advantage of opportunities I said this amounted to go and here I'm getting right to it to take advantage of economic disasters\nFolks please listen here in a society where everyone is always suing everyone think about that eat right everybody wants to sue for this for that everybody's a victim\nDo you believe it should be some of your assets should be protected against this sort of attack I Believe they should be\nLife insurance is not just all about you dying and you leaving tax free dollars to somebody that helps out a lot to the survivors and we can give you first hand stories and accounts of people who have really benefited from receiving tax free life insurance dollars but let's talk about you living\nThe people who have really benefited from receiving tax free life insurance dollars but let's talk about you living let's talk about you\nTaking a portion of those funds and when the markets have sunk to all time low as you get back into mark is that possible yes\nSo here's some questions then go kind of jump around a little bit here but here's some questions because it's a we believe it more financial strategies\nAnd you can give us a call if this is resonating with you'd only Mark I'm never something to talk on the radio like this

to reduce the amount of fuel vapor into the atmosphere however when a code piece zero four four zero set a week has been detected in the engine control much\nThis fear however when a code piece zero four four zero set a leak has been detected in the engine control module vapor sensors has malfunctioned these causes again are looser damaged gas cap\nLeak or disconnected ... poses faulty purge valve faulty canister vent valve charcoal canister leak or leaking feel tank which I got one of those in the shop this week\nOr what you're going to notice as you possibly could have a fuel smell feel vapor order you could have a few a leak like I have on an expedition in the shop because the plastic tank believe it or not as cracked [noise]\nYou know why did they ever go to a plastic field thanks I don't understand that you know the old metal ones we never really had a lot of problems with but the plastic ones you know we live in severe climate in the summertime and they get pretty pressurized [noise]\nPlural we have to an additional ... and uh went ahead and change those or missteps and lo and behold hey guess what the heater works better now the engines getting up to operating temperature [noise] another thing that's really cool to get technical on this the computer likes it because it puts it into fuel control\nBecause the thing is you know a lot of these thermostats or a hundred and Ninety five hundred Ninety degrees they want that engine to run up at a hundred and Ninety five to two hundred and some degrees because that's when it's designed to run it is optimum best and be in total fuel control\nAnd believe it or not when I changed the thermostats in my truck I got twenty more miles to a tank of you know think about that across a year that's a lot\nSo if you're making excuses for your car and you're having to wear little sweater these days because your heater isn't working as good as it could or if you can't remember the last time you changed your thermostat it's probably time I mean I had a six leader in this week\nHe said the same thing he says he didn't think his heater was working as good as it could and lo and behold so much that was the fault\nSo it's something to think about you know your your ...\nYour your cooling system Moran I boil system for your engine ... there's a lot of things involved in that and it's very important that one you have a good service that to you have a good radiator cap because contrary to belief if that radiator kept can't hold pressure then it's going to force\nThe antifreeze anti boil liquid whatever you want to call it out into the reservoir tank and possibly out onto the ground as you're driving down the road so I mean that kept needs to be able to hold specified pressure if it's a sixteen pounds ... sixteen pounds cap it needs to old sixteen pounds not five zero\nUm another thing with the radiator you know it needs to be in good condition when's the last time you flushed rated do you know\nIf you can't answer that question it's probably do I don't care if they say you've got lifetime antifreeze in this thing five years hundred thousand miles are you kidding me\nMy diesel it about thirty five thousand miles about four years old that decks cool is looking like chocolate pudding yeah you know [noise] so you know if it's been a while if you can't remember when it was done get it flushed a lot of our vehicles you know I recommend\nRather than go back with the expensive\nAntifreeze forever fluid um [noise] you know to flush it back to the good old green ethanol glycol it's cheaper and then go with a two year twenty four thousand mile interval on your on your radiate it flushes [noise]\nIt it just it makes sense to maintain because the alternative is just a few weight or let your cooling system run low long enough you can plug the top ... radio\nYou can damage the engine you get enough sediment and they're down along the around the freeze plugs in the side of the engine block they could brushed out and start leaking\nSo it's something to think about you know cooling systems are very important uh you know your hoses you need to be checking those um you know when your engine has cooled off you could go\nTake can feel the radiator whoa see if it's got any saw spots and see if when you squeeze though as if it just crunches and crackles an inside then you know you've got a problem and this time to check to get them change if you got any corrosion built up or the hoses connector heater hoses connect\nYou know it's possible you had to leak there in the past and it's stopped\nBut it will wreak it'll come back guarantee it\nPossible you had to leak there in the past and it's stopped but it will wreak it'll come back guarantee it when you're having is cooling system checked you need a pressurized it\nThat's you know cooling system pressure check you need to be able to pressured pressurized that system up to this specified you know pounds of pressure that it's supposed to hold which is Fifteen sixteen in most instances if it won't hold pressure then you've got a problem [noise]\nAnother reason that you should be flushing your cooling system is is the dreaded heater corps you know I'm sure that we're going to see a bunch of ... failures you know coming through uh the reason is is you know that sediment gets into that little tiny heater corn and it just hangs out there on the roads it from the inside out\nYes so does a really bad coolant huh yeah as a non productive\nA protective agency any anymore and it rots that stuff from the inside out that you don't see [noise]\nYeah I've seen a lot of it and uh if any of us have changed the heat of core lately it's not an easy task anymore a lot of the vehicles you end up removing the entire dash to get that little heater core out of it it's not\nNot a job for the week at heart because there is it it takes all day long on some of these new vehicles to get the inner core out of um [noise]\n\nYeah we we generally a assign our smallest tech to that ... because you have to crawl up inside the dash and sometimes we lose and\nI Know my daughter's not and then she used to be able to do some of them heater course I Know in the past you used to be able to get them out in thirty minutes to an hour\nAnd now it's seven eight yeah so you know things have changed so today we got open lines you can call in at seven five one ten forty one that's seven five one ten forty one we'll answer your questions on your automobiles\nAnd\nSee where we go from there or recovered ... systems um you know we'll talk about uh another thing that we see a lot of is a lean codes that can't talk enough about these I see people you know they go get their coats scanned at the\nCorner store and they've got a piece zero one Seventy one or a piece zero one Seventy four which is lean bank one bank to if it's a V. eight or V. six if it's four cylinder to just throw one lean code for bank one I'm generally\nYou know a lot of people say well I've got this lean code it's an oxygen censor code put an oxygen censor coat in it and it's going to fix it well I have seen that many many times\nWhere it didn't fix it\nLean lean codes generally are on meat or they are going into the engine meaning a lot of the vehicles have a mass Airflow censor in which measures the amount of air flow that's entering the engine\nAfter the air cleaner if you have a vacuum week after the mass Airflow censor\nIt's not measuring that amount of air entering the engine which is kind of what we call a meter day or going into the engine and it's going to cause a ... a problem because there's extra oxygen going in and the oxygen center see it so the oxygen sensors are going to adjust for this\nAnd it's going to give it more feel well it can only go so far and that's where we look at the data called long term field for him which is a value that goes from zero plus or minus twenty five after it exceeds twenty five percent\nIt's going to triple check engine light for lean code if it's a positive twenty five percent it's going to say you know feel systems lean bank one bank to if you got to be ...\nSo if it's a positive twenty five percent it's going to say you know fuel system lean bank one bank to if you got to be ...\nTo go in and fix this again we get out the dreaded all smoke machine and you know fill the intake system full of smoke to see where the leaks are you know you could have a broken vacuum lined you could have a craft\nThat accordion thing that goes from here are cleaner box to the throttle body you could have a crack or in that or it could be broken I'm In some cases you could have leaking intake manhole gas gets\nUm there's a lot of things that can cause as she could even have back to the system you could have a broken ... those lines are plastic and if one of them are broken or disconnected you could ever meter day are entering the engine there\nAnd when you have this lean problem you're gonna have worse gas mileage you could have a problem with the way the engine starts um there's a lot of course you're going to fail emissions\nSo there's a lot of things that go along with that so again if you've got to check engine light on its back to test first don't guess find the cause\nAnd I've seen are probably the biggest no no he's putting his check engine lights off\nI'm hoping that it'll fix itself I'm more than likely you're going to start eating up your oxygen sensors and your catalyst a on this catalytic converters a very expensive to replace some of them part of the uh what we call a white pipe coming off the engine\nOut where these cats are built into their ... and December yeah this can get into the thousands of dollars a definitely a quick\nYou gotta put because when you replace that catalyst you need to put what was on it back on it not cut everything off and weld in a universal that is generally you know I bet a lot of vehicles come in where\nThe customers taken it and they've cut the old ones out welded in a universal catalytic converter and see how they work for about a month and then you're back to the same you know situation where the catalytic converter isn't working mhm\nSo [noise]\nTest first don't guess it's what I always say you know keep these things running as good as they possibly can you know if your fluids or dirty it's time to change and I have seen a lot of vehicles come in where you know the transmission fluid starting to turn brown if it's any color than what it was when it was brand new\nIt's time to service it [noise] so what else you've seen out their weight uh\nWhat else are we saying we are seeing is a um [noise]\nWe're saying a lot of broken vehicles big time um\nGot up to twenty twelve ruby Kahn in here right now it's got a little over a hundred thousand miles and\nWhen's the last time that was changed batteries usually last you know thirty to thirty six months here in Arizona severe climate\nUm you know when's the last time that was changed how old is a battery do you have things something growing on the top of the battery you know contrary to at least they're not supposed to leak and there shouldn't be any corrosion on those battery cable's\nSo if your battery cables are dirty you know it's time to get them cleaned 'em you know as far as the battery being tested if you come to our shop or testing that battery every three or five thousand miles whenever your services and advising you you know your batteries on the way out to its seven hundred coal cranking out she shouldn't have three hundred\nSo you know we're ... and you of that\nAnother thing you need to do you know if you notice some different smell about your car or does it sound like the smell like a sweet smell that would be an anti free sleep does it smell like burning rubber\nUm that could be you know an oil leak so something to think about their you know just pay attention to your automobile like I say it's talking to you whether you you believe it or not it's telling you when something's wrong and it's time to get something done\nMorning lights [noise]\nI Know a lot of people just ignore 'em but they're there for a reason I mean they come on there's something wrong and check engine light generally there's something wrong with the\nEmissions you know feel delivery or ignition or admission system\nA T PMS flights I've seen a lot of those come on lately especially with the cooler temperatures like we said before you know the air air pressure drops his the ambient air temperature outside drops show or see a lot of tea PMS problems um I've seen\nMy fair share of alignment problems to lately with you know these roads are just terrible [laughter] I mean I drive ...\nMy fair share of a line that problems to lately with you know these roads are just terrible I mean I drive all the way across town and I just I'm totally amazed you know the potholes how rough everything is\nAnd you know I've seen a lot of vehicles coming in with the regular retire where you know if you haven't had an alignment and the last twelve months might be worthy of getting it checked\nYou know take a look at your tires\nHow old are your tires there was a date coat on the side of him you know if they're better than four years old to you know they could start dry cracking and you know basically rotting away\nUm you know your front tires she'd taken turn them all the way to the left or the right and you can see the face of the tire you can take a look at a you know is there anywhere on the outer edges\nUm you know that if there's where on both outer edges it could be because your tires under inflated\nThe you're wearing on the outside of just not the inside edge that's why it's important to keep your tires inflated to the proper air pressure\nAnd I want to bring something up on that been getting a lot of discrepancy from the public and the automotive industry on what is the proper tire pressure a lot of vehicles are put an oversized undersized tires on and going by the max pressure that's on the sidewalk of the tire not\nThe what the vending plate or the manufacturers recommended pressure that's inside your most of the time the driver's side entry door frame Sunday pillar yeah [noise] so if you're not sure a secret professional um we can help you out\nUm but yeah I always try to go off with the manufacturer spend a lot of money doing research on on those manufacture tire pressure specs and again if you're not sure go see a professional and let them help you [noise] [noise]\nYeah with my truck I went as far to ah\nTake a white chalk and draw a line across the face of the tire [laughter] no seriously I'm getting all high tech on this thing now in adjusted the pressure accordingly mhm so it would wear that completely off a lot that you and I believe it or not it was right to that manufactures but ...\nIt's amazing how how you how much better your truck rolls down the road and Phil is rolling resistance yeah du jour your teeth out 'cause you got your tires over inflated [noise]\nYou know doesn't fail out spongy like you can't get out of a stop light and get your tires are so under inflated yeah but when they're under inflated boy it sure rides nice nice and smooth and yeah right yeah they're complaining about one to one to two miles per gallon less per tank yeah\nYeah there's a lot to be said for that you know\nTire longevity I mean all the above\nYeah and if you don't want to pay attention to it I'm sure there's a tire sales somewhere just where those things out and go buy yourself a new set [laughter] if anybody's bought a new set of tires lately they're not cheap\n\nOpen lines today you can call in at seven five one ten forty one seven five one ten forty one\nBack to the climates are in you know why to do them you know I I didn't really have a problem with my vehicle but I didn't live in on it anyway\nDidn't know you had a problem I didn't well I had a problem yeah I didn't think I had a problem but you know previous to the lime and I was constantly steering my vehicle as I went down the road it you know it wasn't a real aggressive pool of drift but you know I was always having to correct\nThe stealing from side to side to get it to go straight down the road\nAnd lo and behold the total was off on it and you know that's a minor\nThe stealing from side to side to get it to go straight down the road\nAnd lo and behold the toll was off on it and you know that's a minor adjustment vehicles have ... they have toes they ... up front and they should not be towed in there and not be towed out believe it or not they should be straight ahead\nThat same goes with the vehicle a lot of the you know some vehicles have a toll adjustment on the rear\nSo I mean all these these four tires they need to be going straight ahead but I Know it's my truck after I got the climate done that you know I got about twenty more miles to the gallon or twenty more miles to a tank uh feel\nSo I mean it's important you know we've reduced the rolling resistance vehicle and it drives down the ... down the road effortlessly now\nAnd you probably extended the life of your tires by what twenty five to fifty percent you know it's\nAnything when it comes to those big tired out I mean you know they're super expensive\nHim that's the only way you're going to get a high mileage out of these tires is a nice alignment and nice suspension so\nIn a lot of the things you know outside of toes there's Kamber [noise] there's caster to adjust and these vehicles um there's a ... who you know adjust um they make a lot of cool parts for some of these cars now a vice specialty products you can get over at our favorite auto parts store Merrill's\nUm where we can buy these adjustable control arms\nUm ... uh adjustable top struck plates um which are really cool we can dial these things right in\nHave you been using a lot of those parts lately the adjustable you know control arms and struck tops and different things\nNow yes for the for the far most we see a lot of a factory style vehicles so we don't have to make too many altercations per se um but yeah it's definitely a nice product\nIs [noise] the other thing that happens is you know you ask why did the angles change well what happened you know the angles ... could be that you hit a curb could be you hit it big pothole [laughter] there's none of those around\nA load you know let's talk about what what do you have in the trunk [laughter]\nIf you can't remember you might want to open it up and take a look you know there's certain things that you need to have in there but there's a lot of stuff that gets piled in there that you don't need I mean I opened the trunk on a vehicle the other day and there was a great big wagging in there you go and why do we need this in here you know extra load extra weight being carried down the road\nThis couple of things that are going to happen it's going to decrease your fuel economy\nNow they're saying it's going to change your vehicles Lyman if you've got too much stuff in your trunk\nIt's changed the ride high on the vehicle which has changed your alignment believe it or not if you get junk and your trunk if you get it out and get it out and the other thing that'll affect your ah your Lyman is Warm Springs\nAgain that affects you ride highs\nYou know lately a lot of these vehicles when you know I get them in a hundred thousand miles they got struts weak and there's a cool thing we can buy now is a complete struck which you know it doesn't cost a whole lot more to buy a complete struck with the spring and the ... top than it does just to buy the struck by itself\nI'm you know a lot of these cars they got a hundred thousand miles on it and the ... top plate the bearing mount which has rubber with a bearing in it is worn out if you start peace and these things out and go buy a strike and then by struck top\nUm you know generally you could have bought the whole ... assembly with the new spring for about the same money\nBecause believe it or not the springs where out after a time\nOr another thing that happens to that country\nFor about the same money because believe it or not the springs where out after a time\nOr another thing that happens that can change the angles is you're blushing ... the rubber pushing on the control arm she got lower control arms on a lot of cars you you've got a upper control arms on some that don't astronauts um these machines are made of rubber and the heat in\nTime where them out [noise] so if you've got wishing problems it's going to change your alignment on your vehicle as well [noise]\n[noise] no they seem to think about is this your shocks a lot of these vehicles you know I've seen vehicles go down the road where they're bouncing up and down I I don't know how they can even drive him\n[laughter] yeah it it's just to me or not to mention how fast it away your breaks out to you know the young guys that weight transfer in and they have not and there's no shocks there to hold that vehicle suspension up and or actually the springs would hold it up but I'm", "show_name":
