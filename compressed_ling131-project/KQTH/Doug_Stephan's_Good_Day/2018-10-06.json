I was thinking this morning about the neighborhood I grew up in and\nYou know as you get older you don't remember the bad stuff all you do is you remember the good stuff and so it's very I'd\nBe like in your mind to it was an idea like neighborhood it was incredible is full of kids\nAnd we were always doing something you ever get a ... a piece of plywood out and put a couple of bricks up under it and go across it on your\nBike like evil can evil you're jumping and it didn't go well when you go over the handlebars I mean have you ever done stuff like that and we'd anymore how much I mean we play baseball we play football we spent a lot of time arguing about the call 'cause we we'd we'd always argue about whether\nSomebody was out of bounds we played and played and played and played and played run in and out of each other's houses and\nOne mom always had some lemonade one mom would always have some baloney sandwiches I mean it was a great neighborhood\nAnd I remember being a little kid and some of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man\nI Want to go to school you know be cool to go to school when I can go to school I'll be happy then you ever thought that and and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year I'll be in a grade with a number on it\nI'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy then\nAnd when back when I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school and and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right\nThey own the school right and so you're like man I could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be the I'd be ruined the school man I'll be happy then\nThen you finally get to sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school or middle school which was\nSeven eight nine the school I went to and man\nIf I could just get out sixth grade and go over there in middle school you know they've got I got P. E. they've got football they got cheerleaders cheerleaders their guy lockers man if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that\nWhat led you order a lesson in Miami, Florida Vanessa how are you\nHave a wonderful thanks for taking my call sure what's so a few years ago a resigned our children up for a Florida prepaid college planned and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and since then our income has gone down and we\nAdded another child and we've gotten into some credit card debt and we have a car loan now um\nWe can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without penalty should we do that or should we pay off our debt to leave that money and continue contributing to their pre paid plan marches in there\n[noise] um about any six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars much do you own your car we have ten thousand and what do you own your credit card a five thousand\nOkay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe just started at ... and that's and I realized we did that baby steps out of order with having the\nPizza pan pre play pen and then I don't know what to do at this point gotcha okay I'm In your household income as well\n[noise] [noise] ah my husband next forty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand get retired or um no I Would not carry would stop adding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget follow through with what you're learning influential pollution worse the and just work your way\nAdding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning and financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine the other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency\nA no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an E. S. A. in mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price because that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving a growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent inflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time mind\nAnd so are you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the fun of still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I don't want a better rate of return all my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for for a a ... I was going to be for the last seven years we paid off or a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ...\nThis was a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen uh we were in my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas mhm a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a fuel oil wells but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money mhm uh over a million dollars [laughter]\nLeaders are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom [laughter] and we want to you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one reason west Texas is struggling right now all prices are so far down that there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon it was a boom baby I mean\nBut uh and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all I think just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell although it all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's simply a they're looking at the three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you're just added on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is the risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars per child in the middle kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas where this is the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash yeah well it might but I Am not going to\nSay I start getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes yeah we're a hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be oh person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\nYou know this is I'm I'm helping uh my mother and father make it to say\nOh I see so it's just that they they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yes okay All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all\nBut on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it\nYou know so that that you know struck out right after I sold it I regret it the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not\nSome advisors to the families entire portfolio three million dollar network\nWe caught up in [noise] um\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me [noise] as a financial coach because I Do that I Would say no [noise]\nI I Would take the majority want\nMoney off the tides thanks for calling into [noise] the news to have a blessing like that so\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are a toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over knocks woman at the ball game over there and he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you

I'm I have a friend who has been following you and she gave me some information and I had been struggling at the single parent and I just got a new job in the month of march and I and I'm like I make

to Ninety two a month okay I'm not sure on their car and they have eight thousand less so that's not bad\nBut your your take home page three thousand is thirty six thousand a year so that means you probably making about forty five thousand before taxes is on right\n\nNow I'm at each paycheck is a thousand in something so for the month with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about nine Ninety ... till about three thousand you know out of an income\nOr a little over three okay uh well you don't have a lot of wiggle room here raising two boys um ... but let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills and then trying to eat I Want you to eat and then try to pay bills\nWhat that means is is that we need to start start doing a written budget\nWhere every dollar but for the month begins you look at your paychecks and what they're going to be you look at your child support what it's going to be for this month before the month begins in you assign every dollar\nAnd so we would start with a tie off the top you said you're either med school and that's the first thing we do like ten percent off okay that tide is done now what are we going to next well we're going to eat so second thing you do\nWell that's the first thing we do take ten percent off okay that tide is done now what are we going to next well we're gonna eat second thing you do you eat so you do your grocery budget and you set that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your life in your water\nOkay then what's the next thing you do you do your you pay your rent guess what after ties food rent and lights and water there's some money left but it's not a bunch\nOkay he probably got Fifteen hundred bucks left if I did my calculations

it a thousand you know after you just your run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus my checks minus\n... minus ah my my uh food bit budget whatever my set up for food and a minus ... minus my lights and water now I'm living and I've eaten and the kids have eaten before we do anything else out now we've got a car payment or they're going to report that thing\nAnd we've

vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have\nCome your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to court trailer her car she owes about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest\nWe could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we should we keep it because it's ... percent of\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three\nZero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off what are all three of these cars worse\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay 'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay you're not violating that though show or good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than the eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand okay\nBut that it that includes the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nFive to two men we'll talk about your life\nAnd your money Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking to you for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college money from my one year old mhm I'm I'm I'm Thirty years old\nI'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I put Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have some you know equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him in and kind of\nPicking out some growth stocks mutual fund to see where it goes from there okay um so my my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I deal with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know every any given month is about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shut shut draw towards my how he owned a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is ... dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm because that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now or what do you make\n'em so uh about Seventy eight year\nThere's the household income yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a I had a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nAbout a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it so I didn't know how that kind of played in the card as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory okay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I published it would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay\nAnd that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four O. one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently am I just opened up a ... or re ... with a better man which is one of the global and high hundred for me I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... of\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of them are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time in a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to smart bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business I don't care what you do okay I had an effect my income at all\nBut people always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you're you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each ... unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread ... personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's baby step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different the ... you know number ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nUh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget almost keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't got it\nYou don't or better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand in that a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty abnormal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional from a service academy or three years ago\nUm and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal that I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount for um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be a year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWow so you learn to you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to one thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou have to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either after the surge through and lip service or you're assigned to\nThe recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S\nTreasury so you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time in its forgiven\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with this I did not know that you have to learn something wow well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nCommon theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAbout everything child rearing financially and everything in a ... [laughter] yeah but it can happen it can I address on what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced\nMedication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself you know of of her checking account because\nHeart when I got ... and got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I\nRest my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of initially but if you can get her back\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of eventually\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual\nBut to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again but you like going to see last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again ... ... you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that habit and those that love them but the good news is I have seen hey innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of them\nNow she only to the Medicaid but she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want him just in a in a fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they had control their she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis\nWhen she was sixteen uh as as as we really mentally ill and she is voices if she's not on a couple of different minutes she does\nWell her ... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time so what does she say right now when they call her on ... so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nAre you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them\nBecause you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't think I should be talking she should be telling them to be either one of your among them long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all their donors badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs go and then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right well\nMy husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and\nI aren't going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah\nOkay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're going aren't\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving her any no so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight hundred there does she say look at can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know they got Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take\nSettlement in full will do it and get an an riding and no electronic access to your checking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a film the industry is so you got to freeze them like rattlesnakes because they are [noise] you gotta really tender covering person here\nAnd so you got to treat them like rattlesnakes 'cause they are they got really tender covering person here going into a rattlesnake thin after she starts making some money you got to walk with or emotionally on that\nYou can you can give her the cheerleading ... without giving them money and I think here the rights to all of that there's good news show she can make it out if she makes a good choice [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the

America I could probably take up the whole show talking about this but uh I was traveling last week to see my brother in the Sacramento area uh he's in the radio business and we are put to putting something together that's very special that\nProbably over the next couple of months we will be rolling it out can't let the cat out of the bag quite yet but one of the uh uh we had an opportunity to go to a multiple\nAnd let the cat out of the bag quite yet but one of the uh uh we had an opportunity to go to a multiple sclerosis advancements center and I'll tell you I'm going to talk about this as the salute today because it really changed my life it it really\nHas me looking at things in a different manner I actually call it's actually called the multiple sclerosis achievement Centre located in the Sacramento area and we specifically we're on a mission on an assignment to go visit with a gal who's now in her mid seventies\nAnd uh for a number of years had been a in a number of TV commercials and the uh the eighties and the nineties and also it was on Mork and Mindy so we got to ask her a little bit about all the cast and certainly Robin Williams and Pan Am ... and all that but why we were there was\nTo talk to her and to get a sense in a feel for where she was diagnosed\nWith multiple sclerosis about Fifteen Years ago and not knowing really what we were going to be experiencing we got to meet the people behind the scenes who work with these individuals so the salute to America not only goes out\nTo those who have this dreaded disease and who are wheelchair bound but to those who have given their lives to serve these people are the achievements center is one of six here in the United states\nAnd what was fascinating was the spirit the the esprit de corps\nThe entire atmosphere of everybody who was there which there were probably about twenty five people there\nAre in wheelchairs and their outlook on life now this was a Thursday that we were there and one of the gentleman that we spoke with a quadriplegic all he could do he had a little instrument that was about just right across from his mouth the little ... that he would be able to use a computer\nHe could talk but he couldn't move anything and had it not been for that apparatus and somebody had just done a screen shot of from the torso up you would never know that this gentleman\nUm whose name was Bob was was quadriplegic but he made the comment he said\nThursday is the most important day of the week to me this is what I live for and if you think you're having a bad day because you're French fries or cold for McDonald's or Starbucks messed up your drink think about these individuals\nWho are wheelchair bound and who are dependent upon others to help them and so I asked the question I said Bob at what point did you realize that you had to surrender\nIs this thing called death are you prepared are you ready not just emotionally and physically but financially are you going to leave your family in a better position\nOr in a worst position by not having the right types and kinds and amount of life insurance in place and number two is disability this was interesting or going back to my\nMultiple sclerosis achievement center it was a unsolicited but ah the gal\nWho we were talking with said mark and my brother Paul uh I got to tell you something because I asked her how you doing right now financially how are things going for you she said there was a young man who had just gotten into a life insurance business and I felt very sorry for him\nAnd so what I did and she was a member of the Screen Actors guild she said I bought a disability policy and I bought a long term care policy from this gentleman because I felt sorry for him fast forward to today she is still receiving benefits\nFrom that disability policy and from that long term care policy now unbeknownst to her at that time she thought she was doing him a huge favor and perhaps she was financially\nBut in retrospectively look at how much of a great thing he put in place for her had she not had those two things to be drawing income from who knows where she would be so disability is number two number three is retirement\nThe goal today for many people is to try and get the highest rate of return they can from their portfolio in my opinion whether that's in a four one K. plan or an IRA or in a brokerage account that should not be the ...\nIn my opinion whether that's in a four one K. plan or an IRA or in a brokerage account that should not be the focus the focus should be our use saving enough money to day\nTo make it through retirement\nIt's not about rate of return it's how much are you saving and if you're in your thirties and forties you should be saving about Fifteen\nPercent of your income that's what you should be saving for retirement don't look at me that waitress in your glaze dies or perhaps his thinking man Mark I'm nowhere near that amount okay Fifteen\nPercent as you get closer and closer to retirement because hopefully you bought all the stuff you've taken most of the trips you've done most of the improvements around the house let's try and\nRaise that between twenty and twenty five percent\nIt's not about rate of return\nIt's about how much are you said are you giving yourself a chance a shot at making it through retirement by saving enough\nMoney not just about race to return we're going to talk about this during the second half of our show today it's not about assets when you get into retirement it's about income and for many people that's very difficult to digest but I digress let me go back to the fourth peril and the fourth Farrell is long term care\nI'm a broken record yes but it's so important that people get their arms around having an elder care plan in place that addresses the need should want to rise when it comes to having\nA life changing event something that's debilitating perhaps you're able to stay in your home but for many people it's they have to go to a skilled nursing facility and assisted living facility of some type\nDo you have a plan in place I mentioned the perfect the ideal plan\nAnd what does this have it has everything to do with the five perils of life the five perils of life are always addressed in the perfect ideal financial plan that's what we'll do a number five our taxes\nI Want to read you something here that are just really just came across\nIn one of my emails recently there's a new movie I've I've talked to this is a this is a different kind of movie but I've talked to a book about a book called the power of zero which addresses the fact that it is a possibility for some people that when they get into retirement\nThey are in a zero percent\nTax bracket well this has been so profound this information has so been so moving and so stirring they're actually coming out with a movie I think it's going to be released\nSometime this month if not in November called the power of zero with the subtitle that tax train is coming\nAnd it's a major Hollywood documentary\nWith an all star cast George Shultz PHD's David Walker\nCPA who used to be the controller general for the United states it's lot who many people know as Mr IRA he's been on PBS a number of times gentleman named Tom Hague none of whom we've actually had on our show Ben Miller and then David mic night the gentleman who's really responsible for the content the power zero\nAnd it takes it an in depth look at how the U.S national debt is setting the stage for massive tax increases within the next ten years\nDepth look at how the U.S national debt is setting the stage for massive tax increases within the next ten years and how they'll impact a retiring generation of baby boomers it says this is the first movie ever\nEver to explore our nation's looming debt crisis and the proactive measures baby boomers people like you and me can take to protect their retirement plans from the crush\nOf higher taxes so this is going to going to be released nationwide pretty soon here because the the movie makes the contention taxes will be increasing\nTax deferred accounts like four O. one K. plans and I are age or a huge liability in a rising tax environment think about that many of you who have four one K. plans you're thinking mark what in what are you talking about\nYes the movies going to discuss why tax deferred accounts like four one K. plants in IRAs or a huge liability\nIn a rising tax environment it makes sense doesn't it the map doesn't why do you get out to retirement and you're in a higher bracket because the government desperately needs money although all those funds that you'd deferred way way back twenty thirty maybe forty years ago when you were in a lower tax\nBracket being pulled out in higher bracket is that fair well does anything the government do is does anything that they do fair I don't think so\nAnd why baby boomers point number three in this movie why baby boomers should consider transferring money into tax free alternatives like Ross IRAs and life insurance\nWhile taxes are still historically low too we talked about that wow\nIt's great that they're actually coming out with a major motion picture documentary that\nTalks about this it's just not\nMartin Kenney here in little Tucson, Arizona this is going to hit the theaters across the country this is life changing information the question is are you going to pick up the phone and give us a call and say mark you talk about this I Want to know if I'm a candidate how can I possibly get in these zero tax bracket is that even possible\nWhat can I start doing today now maybe it won't get you to a zero but what if we can save your ten Fifteen Percent maybe even twenty percent would that be worth it to you is that worth picking up the phone and giving us a call\nWe think it is and then on the flip side what if we can get you another thirty to fifty percent in increased retirement income guaranteed\nWe've seen it as high as Ninety percent mark that sounds way too good to be true well some of those things in life that do sound too good to be true are indeed true this is one of those things take me up on the offer give us a call\nTwo nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five go to the Web more F. S. dot com\nThe smart money master plan ... books books by Toni Walker the optimize their packet I have a challenge I'm challenge each and every week to try and keep the optimize or packet below\nFive six seven eight ten pieces of information and articles that I can email to you because I seem like more and more stuff is coming across my desk each and every week that is indeed life changing\nIn the past we talked a lot about annuities about how important they are we do want to discuss those in the second portion of our show here why annuities because things called pensions are no longer for the most\nOn a discuss those in the second portion of our show here why annuities because things called pensions are no longer for the most part around the pension guarantee corporation is in deep deep doo doo\nMany plants that are still out their pension plans are underfunded what if we could put together construct with great great emphasis on you receiving that thirty to fifty percent what if we could create a pension plan that gives you that additional thirty to fifty percent\nWould that be of interest to you hardly have cracked open anything here during the first portion of our show but we do need to take a little break want you to stay tuned hang in there with us we'll be right back with more life changing\nYou\nSo that piece needs to be in your arsenal as well as a piece called income annuities improve portfolio\nSo that piece needs to be in your arsenal\nAs well as a piece called income annuities improve portfolio outcomes\nIn retirement so I said don't believe me don't believe what I'm saying all over the airwaves get these pieces into your hot little hands read up on the unique features found in income annuities\n[noise] there was an article I was reviewing it even before I was coming to the station today and it's called the crisis in retirement planning\nAnd it's by a gentleman named Robert merchant M. E. R. T. O. N. a noble a Nobel laureate in economics so this guy you know this does capture your attention when you find out this guy's a Nobel laureate in economics he's probably got some interesting things to talk about\nSo while he talks about has to do is really the absence nowadays of what we call pension plans\nAnd what has happened over the years and he points it out and most of us who are forty fifties or sixties know that four one K. plans have for the most part replaced pension plans\nAnd traditional\nAt well what's interesting to me is how can we get back how can you as a consumer who maybe doesn't have the opportunity to become involved in a traditional defined\nBenefit pension plan how can we get you back there\nOr we can do it through what we call lifetime income annuities because traditional defined benefit pension plans were conceived and managed really in essence to provide members with a guaranteed lifetime income\nBut we're we we are really attacking this field called retirement planning really reverse in reverse as I said in the first person to are so many people are focused on look at what my four one K. plan returned last year\nLook at the rate of return I receive look at how well it did\nAnd they could say that regardless of how much they put in\nBut if your goal is to make sure when you get out to retirement that you are going to be receiving X amount of dollars in income irrespective of the rate of return\nIt achieved over your lifetime than when you want to know today if you were actually putting in\nEnough money that's the goal the goals should be mark when you come in and am I putting away enough money in retirement assuming I'm going to earn ... percent on that money to even have a chance\nOf making it\nIf nobody has ever shown you what that's going to look like\nThen perhaps you need to pick up the phone and you should call us if nobody has ever shown you based upon what you're doing right now how much you are going to have in retirement\nThan shouldn't you know today so if indeed one of our recommendations is Mr and Mrs client you need to be socking away more money you've told us\nThat you're comfortable with assuming you're going to earn five six seven percent on the money that you are investing in your four one K. plan but what if you are not putting enough money\nAside wouldn't you want to know that today most people would say yes I Want to know that today but then when you get out to retirement let's assume you've met with us we've\nYou what you need to do today because you're maybe ten Fifteen Years away from it\nLet's assume you've met with us\nWe're showing you what you need to do today because you're maybe ten Fifteen Years away from retirement or if you're a young person like trust and how can I get started to date what instruments do I need to be looking at today so that I have a chance and I have options when it comes to retirement\nWe will show you those instruments we will help you navigate the maze of different products that are out there in the marketplace all the noise that you hear through the different mediums be at TV or radio or newspapers or magazines or the Internet or social media\nMark I'm confused what do I do\nSo when you come in and you tell us your story you've been clearly helpless to define what is available and what you can or cannot do with where you are currently\nSo remember you get out to retirement were climbing that mountain the example I've used months and months and months over the last year probably is the mountain climbing example you're climbing up the mountain that the accumulation phase you've reached that to the top you plant the flag you're smiling from\nSheikh the cheek you're so happy he made it but now you have to descend go down back to the bottom to Base Camp that's called retirement and that's where most of the tragedies most of the injuries most of the ... occur is because it's the most dangerous track\nThe could have won it means climbing up or down the mountain it's the downward descent\nSo we will help you understand how important it is and what priorities you need to establish today because the trouble is that most people have the wrong goals they have the wrong measurements\nAnd unfortunately Wall Street has been very misleading and a lot of circumstances\nAnd so our goal is to help you obtain a crew or create accumulate the right amount of money so that when you do get to retirement you have a chance of making\nIt the ideal plan takes all of that into account and that's why\nAn annuity for many people is the answer because the annuity mimics or mirrors what many defined benefit plans did for many people\nWho are retired maybe Fifteen twenty Thirty years ago many people maybe who are listening are receiving pensions why don't we create your own personal private pension plan we can do that the sooner you get started the better\nAnd so we're probably going to I'm probably going to include this piece in the optimize our packet called the crisis in retirement planning\nSee it's not about assets in this article goes on to say is that risk should be defined from an income perspective\nNot from an asset perspective it's about income in retirement it's not about assets and I see people struggle with that particularly the gentleman that come into our office because they still have working it's alive and well what we call the G factor it's greed\nThey want the most amount of income so when I say I would if I can get your thirty to fifty percent they get all excited they like that\nBut I one of my goals is I have to try and keep\nSo when I say I would if I can get your thirty to fifty percent they get all excited they like that\nBut I one of my goals is I have to try and keep ... clients I have to try and keep clients from indulging their appetite for agreed\nThey want that proverbial cake and eat it too they want and both they want to see their accounts grow and they also want to have guaranteed income for life\nThere's some massaging there some mastering that we can do when it comes to that but it's possible\nBut first and foremost when you come in and you sit across the table with us we want to hear your story was important to you argue saving enough money on a yearly basis to even give you a chance of making it are you\nWe will help you understand that that's important to us it should be important to you\nYou know everybody should be focused on the pile of money when they get to the top of the mountain how big can I get that pile\nBut then what happens to most people is there in there and then not figuring out that they can't live on assets\nThey live on income\nAbout your ass as they can be lost they can be stolen they can be swindled sued divorce disseminated\nOr decimated [laughter] in a market crash they could be decimated in a market crash the ultimate success of your retirement is not about assets and that's reading right out of

spend all my time in a garage\nBut ... you need to slow down just a little bit and think about it you spend your hard earned money on a vehicle [noise]\nWhen you buy a new car you will by a warranty

to it yeah\nSo you're just you you you need to take care of it you need to read the owner's manual\nAnd you need to understand you have a commitment that you must do to keep this thing covered under warranty\nSo what you might want to do is take out the boring reading material and actually when you start reading into it and make sure that you're not tired the best time to do it like early in the morning when you first get up here is that there you read the paper\nI mean well some of them do most of them go to Facebook or go to your ... or something like that in electronic but\nRead it in the morning when you comprehend it and think about it and then that'll said today off don't try to read to hold off on book because you'll be asleep and twenty minutes and just ... you need to get after show that you keep your vehicle\nIn the warranty period you can actually keep it in warranty by doing what you were supposed to be doing because I'm a I'm telling you you already pay for three years of auto repair\nAnd what you were supposed to be doing because I'm a I'm telling you you already pay for three years of auto repair\nBats watch originally in the contract if you don't keep your end of
