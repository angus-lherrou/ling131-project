does when he catches the dog in the act this is what I usually hear I yell no take the sock away from him and give me his own sock to play with here it's the owner not the dog was at fault after\nAll we can expect the dog to differentiate between his sock and not the socks\nTo your dog is soccer the sock one minute his own or reprimanded chilling and stop the next parties encourage again\nThis is absolutely what the definition of neurotic behavior is here's my advice\nAnd I just had someone call me the other day Warren my dog is chewing all of my shoes what do I do when my getting my question was what do you do what you said when I see the dog with a shoe I take the shoe away and I get the dog a toy retreat of his own what you did just stand is let the dog know that anytime he wants to treat\nAnytime you want the new toy all we have to do is grab the shoe see some parts are dogs are a little bit smarter\nThan the humans they live with a ...\nCalorie drink contains absolutely\nWell we have to do is grab this you see some parents are dogs are a little bit smarter than to humans they live with a war next night\nKeller drink contains absolutely no drugs\nAbsolutely no stimulants it

misleading here and when we talk about the fake news media this is my very line that makes people go oh my gosh there's that Trump he hates the game that my ... right and it it is that show ridiculous because if you actually read the whole thing and I'm not calling you out here you'll find nothing\nI was I looked at the I forget the story and I looked at the headlines\nIf you actually read the whole thing and I'm not calling you out here you'll find you've been on the other thing I was I\nLooked at the I forget the story and I looked at the headlines that around ... only because it went so deeply into the weeds the first sentence set at all of us [laughter] yeah what kind of a confusing policy is this and why do we have this policy I guess would have been\nMy question but due to straighten it out as usual well graduation dinner on bank you find the ... bucks yes it is okay so let's than as long as we're sort of in this area\nFor a little bit of the um\nFolks in England actually if you live in Wales this affects you as well\nYou now have the option of entering into a civil partnership instead of a marriage\nQuoting to the prime minister so what does that mean means any couple living together and those countries I e England and Wales\nI can choose to have their relationship legally recognized without being married kind of progressive think only used to be on the same sex couples could be granted a civil partnership\nBut any couple now living together\nComes as the u._k. Supreme Court are faced a case brought forth by an on married couple they argue the current law is discriminatory discriminatory discriminatory probably\nToward heterosexual couples court agreed left it up to the parliament to decide\nThose in favor of the change say civil partnerships allow people who object to the idea of marriage to have the same legal and financial protections I think that's a swell idea\nDo we have that protection I didn't even know if we have the protection here in our country I think that that we have now do we civil partnerships but I Know I'm I'm not sure we do seems to me there's a controversy that happened here locally in Massachusetts\nA couple of living together one of them died and the other one wanted or\nThought yeah I think it's a state ... state they think it goes by state doesn't it\nBut why not allow it is a question what difference does it make marriage is a is a governmental Christ\nI agree unreality you should have to stipulate who that person is for you because okay a lot of people who live together with someone who might be just a roommate\nAnd if they die kicked the bud back in that room mate comes out and says well I've lived with that person for eight years ago I didn't hear that and everything [laughter] yeah I mean I think we all get to have a person I don't know if that person is ... is your partner or a friend or family member but I think we all should be able to designate that person regardless of marital status\nYep yes I agree so they have that in the u._k. maybe their end of the curve\nRight I just couldn't make it automatic because you know that poor slot that's renting your bedroom you don't want them to offer you and your sleep and take every [laughter]\nGod no problem not a good idea [noise]\nSo I see that the um the I'm looking at some of the budget you know me I'm a nut case on budgets and spending money in her crazy we've gotten in spending spending spending\nA lot of money being spent on immigration crackdown but apparently a according to some numbers that have been released this week the number of people who were supposed to be deported like three million is with the promise number was is only about ten percent of that yet we're spending a lot of money\nOr the budget has many holes in it thanks to\nAll the efforts is it worth the effort is the question Jennifer is it worth the time and the effort and the money that we're spending to a crackdown on illegal immigration or the ... rid of the people who are here no matter what it costs\nThat no matter what it costs I mean obviously you have to do what I can\nThe people who are here no matter what it costs\nWell about no matter what it costs I mean obviously you have to do a a a comparison but\nI live in a state where immigration is out of control and it had killed that said they said in California is the richest and the poor state all at the same time in the country and that is not only because it's not all immigration smell that really left leaning\nProgressive if you will whatever we want to call it policy that has kind of taking the the path of socialism and has provided the end to the middle class in California or at least the the\nI guess maybe the destruction of the middle class in California but what took it down that path is that nothing was functioning you at schools that were over on you at hospitals that were overrun your to taxpayer money going into pay for stuff and it just wasn't enough because the amount of people\nUsing it were and it would not being covered by the taxpayers in the state so when you see how it has affected California and education were forty seven\nIn the nation when it comes to schools in California\nIt's a combination of not having the resources to pay for\nThe onset of people it's also that people are coming here and putting their kids in school or not learning English as their first language or sorry is her second language and that put the kids at a really bad it\nStarts them at a slow pace that puts them at at a disadvantage so when you see not only the social but the economic dangers of having immigration that's out of control I see yeah ultimately it is worse because the problems in California are going to seep are already starting to see each other states and the ... in the in the country so\nI'm looking at the debt I cover this about once a month sometimes maybe more frequently by the new info the federal debt last month\nOr through last month Cisco two thousand Eighteen this'll Esther\nKnows October starts to reverse oh this is the total federal debt last year increased by one trillion two hundred Seventy one billion one hundred fifty million one hundred sixty seven thousand one hundred and twenty six dollars and Seventy two cents\nYou know this is one thing where I get absolutely crazy as a as a Republican and having the Republicans in charge of the house and the Senate and having Trump in the White House the thing that drives me nuts is that no one with the exception I think of Paul Ryan has the backbone to actually tackle\nCutting the dead the only person that you that you hear other than Trump sometimes on the campaign trail is Paul Ryan talking about cutting entitlement because it's not pretty people are going to like it but\nAt some point we're going to have to do this because the bulk of the money that we're spending is on entitlement programs it's not in the military it's not an all of these other areas that keep the country running it on people getting money from the government we have\nTo fix that somebody's going to have to run on saying look this country needs a diet it's not going to be easy but if you know gather in trying to be better absolutely\nSo this is the eighth year in a row\nWhich the debt has increased by one Freudian goes we also now the United states of America in debt Twenty one crew you in\nFive hundred sixteen brilliantly fifty eight million one hundred eighty three thousand one hundred thirty dollars you twice as many numbers asinine it's craziness it's it's a what it is a suicidal\nSuicidal\nAnd nobody pays any attention the economy is great bunker them ...\nThe economy is great but you know what will make it the country healthier and give us long the longevity is\nMake is using this great economy to say okay now we need to cut back a little bit it's how people get wealthy if you are individually trying to you if you make a little money from the stock market you don't just go out and spend it no huge cut back a little more and you spend a little advice\nIt wealthy if you air individually trying to you if you make a little money from the stock market you don't just go out and spend it no huge cut back a little more and you spend a little invest a little more and then all of a sudden you're doing really well but it might hurt in in the interim\nAlright food for thought here forty six and change FDR on the D.

have the choice to pay a dollar an hour for in home care\nFive dollars a day at a daycare center each child or adult\nSo in other words Starbucks will pay an extra buck on your pay if you have somebody at home being cared for five dollars a day if it's a child a day and a dollar an hour or five dollars a day one of the seven\nBeneficial for them because they're going to have to pay you know if if somebody behind all day yeah you got to do for a new study then that's a lot for Starbucks tell if they pay than an extra dollar and have them at work all day then it's kind of a benefit for everyone yeah\nSo rare benefit and our job market here in our country it's done in Europe and other places as a national survey of children's health came out this week nearly two million parents quit their jobs last year because of not enough for care service\nAnd have child care services so that's a whole different thing as a kid my mother my mother wasn't really but she was there any way a lot
