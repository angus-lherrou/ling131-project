the other hand humans are opportunists not special is which means if you take away one source of food for us will quickly adapt to another\nOpportunists and finding opportunities begins when we're very young\nAs we curiously explore our world is imbedded in us hard wired into the look for opportunities now whether you want to use your natural inclination for opportunities to find new ways to

take this opportunity to think about it as a doctor Christian county dot com trait\nIt out loud them out for doing it and I agree they're doing it too quickly I Know lead this line of a healthy economy but it well you know you need to do\nIt always does that mean that what do they stupid they don't know history every single time you do this these people were overplayed apart every single time it causes a slowdown in the economy so\nStupid they don't know history every single time you do this these people over play the part every single time it causes a slowdown in the economy\nSo it it doesn't balance out you go too far take a step or two too far in one direction or another\nAnd it screws things up the death even though we may have a great economy is very delicate balance is very very delicate it's there's so many moving parts and the trade situation is another uh is another part of it and that is a is that it's dangerous and so these people want to win the election next month\nAnd you look at the economic indicators they are good for the next two years\nSo and that that will be if the if it goes down and two years trouble never get reelected\nAnd I would think that would be on his mind to a point\nAt any rate uh it's uh it's just not a great situation for if the economy slows down\nIt just it doesn't bode well let me go back to that same business up and down the unemployment is three or at least ... reported unemployment is three seven percent so it's always twice the number of people out of work hours twice with the government says it is 'cause most people after they go through\nOr whatever benefits they can get their unemployed they just don't they just disappear\nI let us as the Trump stir doing outlining a new plan that aims to lower drug prices\nFalling a new way for Medicare to negotiate and pay for certain drugs\nBased on what other countries are paying why hasn't this been done before would be the question why didn't the previous administration and all the hoopla about Obamacare why wouldn't that have been part of the thing that would benefit Americans or why Americans who pay and American\nOr who get this stuff\nUm Trump said quote we're taking aim at the global free loading the forces American consumers to subsidize lower prices in foreign countries you know that we pay more here this is not Trump speaking this is me we pay more for drugs in this country than any other country and most of them are made easier\nBy American companies right into the American companies is growing the Americans and everybody else around the world\nPays less in some cases ... okay All right this is well aware when you win on both sides of the aisle because you're right the medicine is at the tells the drugs and everything it's just too expensive to\nThirty percent they want to cut the prices by thirty percent of the next five years\nPresident also proposing changes to physician drug reimbursements for doctors would be paid a flat rate that having a monetary incentive to provide higher costs drugs I think it's outrageous they get any money at all ... from the drug companies that were kind of a deal is that\nSo anyway lowering prescription drug prices are the are that's an announcement made just in time for the midterm elections you're going to be sure there was political motivation to they have it's okay\nSo I mentioned Obamacare or the Trump shows are trying to relax guidelines for states to opt out of Obamacare new changes which are have been published this week states apply for a new expanded state relief and empowerment waivers Jennifer\nStates could use the waiver to determine who gets financial assistance to pay premiums and it changed the type of coverage\nThat a is a prioritized in the markets are I don't necessarily I don't understand a lot of this stuff frankly I don't understand why there's only a certain amount of time to change your provider under Medicare rules\nAnd uh just I think that the whole thing that whether it's Obamacare or other owner's rules or the whole policy is it's all meant to benefit the insurance companies and the drug companies and benefit you why can't you change whatever you want to\nThe whole policy ... meant to benefit the insurance companies and the drug companies and benefit you why gates Jane whenever you want to whether the artificial October November or the times you can change your coverage why I Want to change my company's next June why can I make any sense does it\n... thank you [noise] and I know it doesn't it's stupid it's a terrible

Center for Republicans ... they did know Newark Newark Newark is that like your ... works for Newark right mark director\nUh they did to admit they did some research they did a poll and they talked about it and let it go division in the United states in a newly released survey found that more than eight and ten American think the country is greatly divided\nAbout important values just twenty percent of Americans say they think the country will become less divided over the next few years thirty nine percent think things will get worse and a strong majority of the American Seventy seven percent\nSaid that they're just satisfied with the state of politics in the country that is bullet conducted October eleventh through fourteenth so that is before the suspicious\nThat they're dissatisfied with the state of politics in the country that is full of conducted October eleventh through fourteenth so that's before the suspicious packages\nAnd and all of the uh the intensification of of even this problem so I imagine those numbers are even higher today but it's done in the final sprint towards the mid term elections in which President Trump has been rallying\nHis supporters to turn out to vote in November however fifty nine percent of Americans disapprove how Trump is handling his job as president forty percent of Americans according to this poll actually approve of the president's job\nAnd I think how Americans are viewing ... the president divides itself along partisan lines according to the pool at least eighty three percent of Republicans approve of how Trump is handling his job\nNinety two percent of Democrats sixty one percent of it of independence said that they do not approve so I think you can take a couple of lessons and this obviously we know we're divided and that's something that we need to tackle on both sides of our political aisle but you can also look to see how\nI don't know if I've ever actually bought anything I was looking for a mere earlier that year and so I checked on way fair but I did not find anything\nYeah and he was looking at it wasn't she as she lived\nIn for a mere earlier this year and so I I checked on way fair but I did not buy anything but yeah I think don't worry and was looking at it wasn't she as she was when she was buying like everything ... shells and all that stuff yeah I think she got some stuff from way fair\nShow signs of the times way fair announced this week they were launching ... uh two\nStores for the holidays to see\nHow it goes so says back to the area everybody's worried about losing brick and mortar stores to what's on line well way fares decided to buck the trend [laughter] they're opening I noticed because they're opening one of the stores in the ... the next time for me you're\nOpening another one excuse me in a mall a plaza down in ... New Jersey which isn't far from Victoria\nYou you know I Do the same story the other day three about similar I think all these all these stories that you thought were online only like ... Parker that's a glass to store that's where my glasses or from Edward a ton of young people buy stuff they're opening brick and mortar stores there's like three different ones in DC so all of these companies that never thought they would open door\nOpening them now which really intelligent up thing yeah\nAbout what people's preferences or they may want to I think there are more and more people are getting\nTired of ordering things and when they come here on what they thought they were going to be they put up a boxed them up and send them back again takes time so you're not really saving anytime by bad or you know the convenience factor kind of get blown when you have stuff that you get that isn't what looks like on the picture\nShow could look away fear I Hope that that trend continues directly Twenty one after the hour on the D.

J. B. show [noise]\nHi I'm Warren ... with the pet show tip of the day how many times have you heard me say Spain and new to your pets\nEight million to ten million dogs and cats end up and us shelters every year\nSummer last summer day in a bad thing and some are homeless here's an easy way to avoid and that number ... ... a new to your pets to proceed acme formed at an early age and Spain neutering nothing just cut down on a number of unwanted pets and the court just a moral issue it has had a substantial benefits your dogs and cats as well\nStudies now show that also lowers the risk of certain types of cancer and reduces the risk of getting lost by decreasing the tendency to row\nSo there's no excuse if you have a dog or a cat\nSpanier neuter again it's the moral thing to do but equally as important I'm assuming you love your dog or cat you don't want to develop problems and they get older too ... neutering can make all the different in a while for female dogs no chance of breast cancer from al ... obviously no chance of ... neuter it's the right thing to do um our next I\nMessages and NBC outfit yeah I see you later Megan\nToo bad that you do your own whole I don't hold a grudge I just think that it's a very good lesson this is a fabulous lesson for everybody in all fields\nDon't over play your part\nThat's basically the bottom line it happens in business that happens in personal relationships it just you got to know the audience you gotta know who you're working with he got to know who the boss is you gotta understand your place\nAnd that's it and I don't mean not to rock the boat on the world's number one boat rocker that's why I'm working for myself and my own company because I wouldn't put up with a nonsense\nThat comes with having to work in a big media environment that I like working for ABC to like working for CBS yeah\nBut was it a pleasant environment new and so this\nBecame a being on the air in stations that belonged ABC or CBS was was fun fabulous was cool it was a wonderful experience but the nonsense the more on that run these companies and the way they get at ya uh you know they it's just I had one [laughter]\nWhat had cave you see I had one too many meetings with the boss and I liked the people I mean you know and this is Bob was my boss there and he and I loved each other for\nForty five fifty years we've known each other since Nineteen sixty eight what's that fifty fifty years right we've known each other and then rent or an oldie is we are [laughter]\nAnd we're still hanging around together so but he wasn't that he was always people loved working for him because he was smart first of all the understood the radio business that talk business he'd had fabulous people weren't\nHe wasn't that he was always people love working for him because he was smart first of all he understood the radio business that talked business he'd had fabulous people working for him he discovered some of the greatest talked talent there was beside me\nAnd I laugh at the Allen Berg who is probably one of the most talked about talk people in the history of talk radio Bob Ronald ... will be in I'm\nIn um Denver which is where ultimately sized demise 'cause he was he was tough he was tough on the air man and he paid for with his life\nUh anyway uh some ... digressing a little bit but it's tough working in these environments\nOne [laughter] but digressing [laughter] Megan Kelly as I recall what [laughter]\nWhere this all started a ... a girl out here and I go\nThere All right a Google has a problem\nAnd ah this past week they fired forty eight employees for sexual harassment and they departed without a severance package you're fired clean out your desk and get out\nIs that that was kind of interesting avid they'd been accused of having a culture there those two guys at the top are kinda perverted dinner way is that am I Am at the right company I think that the Google it on that those two guys Sergei in lose a or whatever they all his name is those two guys\nThat I don't know maybe there knows about that care yeah I don't\nKnow the details there there was a story that came out this week I think the guy who created Android that operating system had been accused of something and I think Google went out of their way to try and protect him I didn't read the story I don't know all about it but I think\nGoogle has tried to combat rumors that they have a a culture of that but I think they're suffering from the same problem that like every other big company and suffering from\nYep right All right let's see here a couple of other people in the news ... who is the son of whoever it was\nWhat was the other guys and there was this is this your your mom because she'll get junior and Roger ...\nHe's the guy that guy he's the journal that if you've got ...\nLiterally and figuratively or so he had been banned from trout his name is ... ... ... they had said the leaders of Saudi Arabia said you can't leave the country\nAnd now they've changed their mind because uh apparently Mike Pompeo has said to the Saudis let this kid leave let him leave the country he wants to come to America let them come and they let them come\nSo it'd be interesting to see what he has to say once he gets here and get settled in\nAbout ... of this Julie sweat and they can remember her sure\nShe was the one who uh made claims against Brett Kavanaugh apparently they were false or at least that's what the Justice Department has been told by Chuck Grassley who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee so his ass adjusted to buy a new investigator wow\nThe uh uh he referred sweat Nick and her lawyer of an ID or to the Justice Department because they provided false statements to Congress that'd be interesting to see how that works out I Know what do you\nThink of that are really bad he's had a really bad couple of weeks and I only see he lie understanding for flushing phony\nHe lost his office space to because I guess he's screwed over some of the other partners in the legal business and then he also um had to pay the legal fees at the gym for a million dollars for some other a lawsuit that he was involved in now it seems that this is a a fake claim which I think\nAnd had to pay the legal fees to the gym like four million dollars or some other a lawsuit that he was involved and\nNow it seems that this is a a fake claim which I think and he lost favor Democrats you really liked him because he was such a vocal critic of Trump ...\nYeah no a lot of people thought that when he brought in Julie sweat next to the judge Kavanaugh thing that people realized that that story was kinda stinky and it smells funny and it almost took away the credibility of Dr Christine Ford because it seemed like it was a pile on and\nThat and so a lot of Democrats are upset with him you\nKnow he wanted to run for president maybe he'll it on and on into is in NATO ... helped me he goes to maybe\nHe conspired according to charges to broad false statements during Kavanaugh's confirmation the issue that shakes out forty five after the hour hearing the D.
