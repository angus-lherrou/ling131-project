warmer and more and more wet I think okay I didn't really know the Nina and the Santa Maria Maria at all I care about\nThem because I just thought it was it was interesting to watch ... who is the pitcher for the Dodgers and their doctors are not used to playing in conditions like that and he was out doing his that warm up with a sleeve shirt on and shortly after that he got out of atoms in the world whether yeah\nYeah yeah it was not a pleasant it was really not but you know what else I saw that was really kind of nice not that it isn't more typical in baseball and it is any other sport\nBut the players all seem to know each other and they all seem to like each other like the guy who stole second base or rancho ... dogs but I Can't remember his name\nAs soon as he it up what's it what is it\nI Can't remember his name but he's designated hitter\nYeah he got the guy who was on second base helped him up and then they started talking to each other about what's what and then you watch that's what I look for when I look at the game who's talking to him and all of these players from both teams as they got around\nA we're all talking to each other and it's not that kind of and maybe the tone is set by the fact that the coaches are as friendly as they are so they wish\nThat it's not like Yankees Red Sox 'cause that's all yeah that'd be are really angry at least I Am not Haiti either in fact I hardly ever get to play each other which right it makes it different but I was there should be able to the red Sox\nYeah and I feel like they're both having fun and yeah the red Sox have had this dream isn't it fun to watch it and those are the teams that are there deserved to be there they've worked hard the Dodgers were in third place in September he has said that they were able to get there again it's a thing\nI think the red Sox had amazing here\nThey have won a hundred and three of a hundred and sixty two games I Believe the Dodgers one hundred\nIs that right or night like Ninety Ninety ... and I like that yeah\nWell good luck to them both seriously I we talked about by the red Sox but I think what I saw last night made me feel good because it was away from\nThe anger and the silly stuff that goes on even in everyday life what a great lesson sports often depending on the sport teaches us really good lessons about life\nI think that and if they don't the players they have the opportunity to do that and I think the last night's game anyway it was a very good sort of a thumbs up in terms of uh playing a good game and having some fun after all I don't watch many games a matter of fact [laughter]\nI was looking at one of the shots and I I recognize somebody who is sitting behind home plate a it was really you know because the Boston the crew from

I have a lot of people who are watching Chicago fire and hit by bringing in these two new franchise pd a couple of years ago and then the latest they're able to really kind of cross promote their whole brand new programming so I think the crossover event helped build the ratings for all the shows\nNow you see the same characters in and out as you suggested of each of the shows are so that is

and so are often this\nUh this virus doesn't really cause severe illness very often but in this case because these kids are already dealing with a you know read a respiratory illnesses or other kinds of illnesses that weakens their immune system and they were more susceptible to this\nUh and as we've learned ... uh this morning that a seventh kid has died there are now eleven sick we don't know the conditions of the other eleven so uh this uh you know hopefully ... the rest of them are out of the woods soon but uh this is a very serious outbreak\nWell I understand there's a vaccine for this virus but it's only available in the military\n... that I'm actually not aware of I have not seen\nThat yet saying only is it wise but it's only available to military recruits but in this instance you know I don't know with kids that are or aren't that sick I don't know if you can really\nUh immunize them to this kind of thing but we and when you look at the hospital you think that's a place to go where are you you don't get sick in the hospital you bring your illness there but in America that's not always true\nYeah you know in fact actually the number one cause of death in hospital is a infection hum and because you are in a place where there are many people who are sick are dealing with inflections and uh then communicable diseases such as this one where it spread through coughing or a you know by having it you know you\nOften it's on your hand and then you touch us around and then it stays on the surface and someone else touches it those diseases can spread so easily in the state or health department of New Jersey said that they did find\nSome minor hand washing deficiency so whether that was the cause of this outbreak uh you know whether the link to that remains to be seen but that is something that they're saying they're working to correct a and and this is a disease that we know can be picked up by touching the surface\nAnd which is there but as I said most often this does not cause a severe illness but in these kinds of situations where where you have people in this kind of care or it can end in close quarters that can spread quickly and and that's exactly what we've seen here\nAnd what about staffing is are they up to up to snuff in terms of having enough people to disinfect hospital\n[noise] uh supposedly the or the um the there there hasn't been any word that the facility itself has any staffing issues and we know the the representatives from the\nUh there's an inspection team on site that is working to obviously inspect this outbreak uh and work with the a facility to figure out exactly how this happened and what what they can do to prevent it\nAnd then we know they're all ... ... a health department teams on site and they'll go through a day of or they've ordered the center to stop taking a new patients until uh the outbreak is over and or any issues have been corrected so hopefully this isn't something that will happen here but this has been seen in the past the CDC says that are\nIn a in a paper in two thousand one CD said that there was a an an outbreak in Nineteen Ninety eight that killed eight people in Chicago and so sadly every
