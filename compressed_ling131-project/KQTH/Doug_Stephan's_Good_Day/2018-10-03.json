I went to the farm run school I have huge cabs and that's ... basically because of me riding my bike as much as I did I didn't ... I bought bikes\nIn California and they would all get stolen\nI had them I promote hind or as when I was there but if I leave them next to the house that I had first or in a in Santa Monica had a little bungalow and I left the bike next to the bungalow and uh I'd come back and it would be gone\nSo anyway that's neither here nor there I just like I had more I bought it\nTurns out here today in by bicycle locks maybe I should have added that into [laughter]\nVery cute Victoria ... anyway let's get some exercise today let's walk to school as bike to school let's go rah rah rah she's going by\nUs that brings us around to are we going ra ra for television actually is a pretty good TV on these days Jennifer it's nice to have the regular network television shows back from my perspective anyway ah what do we have\nThat what it was the early buzz on some of these shows anybody really excited about that FBI show is pretty good I saw the second episode last night the two main characters are quite likeable\nAnd uh and see what the word is in it now and she's like a bowl and journalist is to say there's a lot of good they're putting a lot of push behind the show because it's it's very interesting I saw something yesterday one of the trades about how CBS is trying to woo Dick Wolf\nBecause his productions are so successful\nOr even though they have things like NCI as some of these shows that spin off into other shows a Dick Wolf is by far the most prevalent name when it comes to spin offs that ever has been a part of television what can I long he's been at this for thirty four years if you go back to the first law and order\nIt was almost Thirty years ago I figured it may have been even a little more than that\nAnd he's been then the ... in all the law and order shows and and now he's got this FBI thing as so and then she gets a Chicago shows he's really very prolific so those are good shows or what else do you any of you find anything that you've seen very good worth mentioning\n[noise] um I just haven't dive gay in yet to a kid my DVR but I liked that cool kids shell sitcom on Fox I told you about the very cute kind of like an updated Golden Girls which eat

talked about Joe Morton yesterday who is the batty from scandal is playing God now and that new movie about a new TV show by God it's [laughter] it's just very interesting\nIs the Betty from scandal is playing God known a new movie about a new ... it's very interesting to see how these people get around and you quickly if they're really good at their crap you forget about the last character they played and get into this character er which is also quite good so\nHey we're carries he may be very good that it's worth mentioning beginning of the season\nNot or that the that I've been watching

from\nWal Mart or with people in the news as our focus now the story of Helmut Kohl ...\nWho was arrested after a woman claimed he approached her while she was sitting on a bench outside of Wal Mart with her daughter\nThe woman whose name is Tracy Nye told police this guy Mr cold asked her if she was married before changing the subject to her daughter's getting ready to be creeps out lady a ... seemed like a friendly conversation he didn't seem like\nA threatening person at first\nAnd then he started badgering ms by asking if she would sell her daughter\nBeing person at first and then he started badgering ms by asking if she would sell her daughter to him he said he had one hundred thousand dollars\nAnd then he went up to a hundred fifty thousand and then he went to two hundred thousand I Will buy your daughter for two hundred thousand the daughter was sitting next to her on the bench\nAnd he grabbed the girls wrist and kissed it hoarding to the mother of before she got creep judge screamed and there's a picture of this guy that you can find if you look around and the the jail birds section of your favorite\nAnd he looks like the lead singer of Jay and the Americans to me a J black he looks just like him but he does also looked like he just looks like you're looking at his\nEyes what is wrong with people I that's it that's my I don't know that's my question I mean is that where you can go now all Mario games yeah\nGo ahead and we're able to what other what brings people to that point ... is it about angel illness is that the island is it somebody perpetrated some awful crime on then what what the heck get people to that point\nLet's go back to what you just said I Believe this study that's out this week confirming the link between violent video games\nAnd physical aggression and there's a debate that continues didn't never happened in my house it was no you can't have any video games have any sort of they were making a difference we had no video games than ours when Reagan and Brennan grow up none\nAnd if I had children or I Would say the same I say the same to my daughter hopefully about my grandson miles\nOf because it does these studies prove that players become more physically aggressive\nThere were Seventeen thousand adolescents who were surveyed from the ages nine Nineteen and the uh results from playing violent video games led to increased physical aggression\nSo when we're training pilots to be in the air force what kind of video games do they use for that anybody know what it's like grand theft auto call the ... those are the ones that are real bad\nNow like raining known for training those are flights simulation games\n... oh yeah okay yeah I thought they ... sometimes they would just regular video games so my question to you not to Victoria or Jennifer Cara because they're not parents those of you who are parents and those of you who let your children play with these games\nHow do you look at yourself in the mirror\nAnd you can yell at me all your like 'cause I Know yell at me when I talk about football so you can yell at me about this\nYou're a bad parent [noise] you are I'm sure\nIf you let your children play with these game Europe that parent is violent you well I say that you're a bad parent if you let your child play football you've heard me say that picked or yeah yeah yeah and now with this new study on football injuries that's another\nOf interest out this week or the or if and and this is interesting because the suggestion here listen up if you are having your children allowing them are encouraging to play football maybe there is a way to make it safer\nOr there are a ... there's a focus on kickoff rules that may lead to a significant reduction in concussion rates there was a letter published in the journal of the American Medical Association after the ivy league athletic conference changed its rules couple of years ago\nThat are published in the journal of the American Medical Association after the ivy league athletic conference changed its rules couple of years ago to move the kickoff in such back lines in games there was a very serious reduction in a concussion rate apparently among players\nSpecifically the average annual concussion rate in the college conference was ten per one thousand plays\nAt a drop to to\nWow that's quite a significant drop yeah it became twenty percent of what the problem had been before that sixty nine Seventy percent or more reduction and the rate of concussion incidents\nKickoff returns like closes at risk to concussion because it involves players running at a speed toward each other over long distances yeah it does sort of makes sense because you're not really banging into it right right right\nThat's the hardest hit is usually on the kickoff return\nHi so what would happen if Israel was introduced in professional football or would it ever\nBe I don't know that it would ever a because that people want to see that hard hitting there used to what they're used to so it would have to probably be something that\nWas implemented overtime but a you know with the more lawsuits that come and the more class action the NFL I mean the NFL getting hit in the pocket book we all of these things so who knows I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility I Do think it's unlikely though\nYeah All right food

good idea that's an excellent uh approach to a health and longevity speaking about health\nBum movies living healthier lives in the city than bumblebees who live in the country who would have found that ...\nAccording to research living in urban areas experience healthier lives than their counterparts who live out in the ...\nTheir colonies are larger they seem to be better fed and they are less prone to disease\nUrban colonies survive longer than the country cousins they have a this research\nUh looked at wild caught mumbo bees in agriculture and the uh like the cousins who are in urban environments every week the researchers counted the beep population in each five three times who wanted to have that job colonies in the city grew larger than those on the farm\nSo people who study and they were looking at these for the past eight years or so they see changes in our farmland here's the most important part of this for everybody to take away it's nice kind of fun to tell the story about how the bees are healthier in urban areas but their reasons for it\nThe reasons go directly back to insecticides pollutants\nIn the country coming from Monsanto and that ilk the sprays around up type product killing the bees we've heard that story before about how bees are dying right and left because of their exposure to this crap that's put on\nIt ... it was a self serving part of this is the farmers need to be more aware of this because without the bees they don't get ... get a crop yeah so you're you're you're kind of cutting off your left leg here using this stuff and that's what this study showed eighty years\nThey'll look over the since World War two especially farmland has had a problem with pollinating insects like bees and was because of the insecticides\nAnd so what is beautiful country side is turning into a wasteland be wasteland anyway chemicals have been shown to slow rates would be reproduction\nIncrease the prevalence of parasites and to be colonies\nSo is this is very important they they don't there's no spring in the city where are they going to spray the side of the building\nSo well in New York they spray for um mosquitoes but\nUm that's usually not where mosquitoes are are always around you know puddles and things like that they write so it's really not where bees are so in Central Park they don't sprays Central Park is actually surprisingly organic\nAnd all of New York city really is it's a very green that even though people don't think it unless you live there but I'm Still the bees are thriving and a lot of people has on the pollinator gardens and heritage gardens that that's like a big trend right now that people are planting at home\nAnd a and a lot of people are planting specific plants to help the bees and to attract them\nUp as well we should be yeah speaking of mosquitoes\nYoung mosquitoes who eat small pieces of plastic\nContaminating other members of the mosquito tribe but also other insects and mammals\nHere's another bit of research on what's going on we talk about bees or they're important people say mosquitoes than on important but in this ... in this case they are because they're indicative of what's going on in that sub a spectrum of life\nThat we don't pay a lot of attention to and so if the mosquito larvae by his coming along each these ... bits and pieces of micro plastic residue the plastic remains in the insects body into adulthood\nSo the micro plastic could then be transferred to whatever might eat the mosquito birds come to mind\nResearchers say it's not a stretch to think that plastic could move up the food chain in that way so then you let's say a pheasant eats them mosquito and you shoot the pheasant eat it you're getting the plastic uh-huh here but\nAlready getting plastic from fish right and I just say so we're all and that's already documented the micro plastics and fish\nIt it it changes the the the DNA of fish and it actually ruins it disrupts their fertility and other fish can't actually that's why the fish population people talk about oh well just plastic straws it's so much more than that\nContact lenses it disposable contact lenses I was reading about that last week that ending up in in in the ocean and and and fish are eating them because you know they reflect\nThe light coming through in the water and it looks like tiny fish and so the other fish are eating contact lenses now that's that can't be digested\nAnd so we're going to have to start really worrying about the population of fish because the plastic it's ruining their their reproductive system so if they can't multiply then we're going to be really screwed it's so much more than than just talking about straws\nMicro plastics in small latex beads are pretty much everywhere put a toothpaste now
