blessing in disguise I Am working again\nI'm making less money but a lot less stress and so what does your input on a plan that we had to sell our house who to pay off all of our debt and and kick start us going in and be kind of start over\nHow much debt that you have not counting your house or fifty three thousand [laughter] and so on your home will clear that yes and then suddenly would a much more would you put in your pocket past that\nAre probably about twenty five plus thousand math or you know we'll ... and everything\nOkay and so um what's your household income today\nAbout eighty thousand okay so you just don't like the house\nWe're not in love with it or we bought it for and a half years ago um 'cause we wanted to chase somebody else's dreaming and then we're realizing it's not our dream and\nIt was either a mortgage racing\nJust deciding oh I Love her out of this man you know I'm so we we don't we're not ... uh and we have different goals in our priorities have changed so\n\nOkay so where are you going to live\nA well that was kind of in the plan with we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put uh some of the other money put it in as our emergency fund and then either rent for a short period of time what we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy a smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know they will enjoy\nMhm so I [noise] um\n\nUs America was the last you are with us this is the Dave Ramsey show Marian is with us in New York City Hi Mary Ann how are you\nHype and how are you trying to than the fan I'm thinking that around here so certainly thank you how can I help [noise]\nOkay so I and follow your plan for like a couple of months now I had the emergency find that I'm working on baby step too good on that night and I have made progress not a ton of it's on our best\nAnd I ask you this idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I Am not letting it take over my life good on my question is is how do I I check 'em for like a doctor ball\nI met ... recently I recently switched ... started again I'm\nAlso the chronic illness you're going to hit the adoptable every year\nRight um\nIt's ... thank God it's nothing on the go it's not they don't hit and it's not life threatening are you going to double every year\nWell okay so now also they look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is that it's a pain in the Senate that the doctors are unsure of what comes on okay so if it was over there but I Do I'm sure because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nBut what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think\nWhat was your what I Want to do is airing on because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the battery estimates are badly because once you've ... battle for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kinda guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget items so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand noted ... every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing chronic medical and just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so so much for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like the way I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month and then a kick out fifty dollars that you can do right now\nOn what I I'm I'm hoping overtime out there but the you know pay out more\nSo why are we finally got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where\nI got an added that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand island that\nI make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition and actually switched jobs I had more flexibility\nOn Sunday that fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and then I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck and\nI knew how to drive a month on my ... twice a month okay and you said you're living on it I guess I'm I'm living with a very late I pay nine Seventy five or rent it give us a lot um\nAnd I do that for help from my ... and what is the nature of the debt\nStudent loan that fat is everything credit card I also because they can handle it I was trying lot of holistic thing mhm on medical ... student loan or most of it if I got it out there that\nHave like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food pantry\nNot eating you know not eating outside in your pantry like in your life from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation\nSo food shoulders loading in transportation utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as a end of the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nAnd here's the thing you're either going to repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\n[laughter] you're told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... actually I've I've got home we had a full how do I prepare\nFor it you save uncover it so now that's our short term long term we got to get your income up and you're out go down and knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but um we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is Tom for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you\n[noise] I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step the right now I'm In fact we gets paid off our second credit card the day that we are done like credit card and move on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're worried that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nI don't know if we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can give later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of I thought the eighth of all I Want to get your input on it\nHave our ten percent by it but we want to live without thinking about Clinton bought out and given back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to\nUm other charitable organizations that we believe in that are about the one day a ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trying to give what we can to people who need it\nBut if she's on the other hand wants to get straight ten percent a church and being what we don't what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give ... percent of the church and we had a big argument about high then yesterday I was\nOut on the the definition of dies the definition of the time there's when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament\nIs tent it literally means chant the\nWord means tamp it doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker ... Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you I Love you and um you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout\nThe Old Testament and Jesus root for him to the New Testament is a time of the tens of your income even just\nGifts and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed the New Testament is a ties a tenth of your income [noise] evangelicals have taught and believed for Fifteen hundred years the ... is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer your wife wins the argument [noise] touched the biblical lots of your wife and his argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that brother [laughter]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nI'm On and off and I'm right now we're in we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand and cars twenty two thousand and other debt like credit cards and all that\nSo one Osama includes cars\nYes 'cause the cars fifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's the ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income\n[noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty\n... a year where did you use to mount the old job yeah\nThat that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate ... I've got to to the house has sold the cliff teens and ... by the end of uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand\nBy the end of the year and that was what does your why didn't make of the ...\nFifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and everything is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [noise]\nOkay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates you get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor\nAnd sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married we are doing this together\nIn other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just give them hell that cancer thing there by yourself and those scripts that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her is that we needed my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these qualities of course we'll have\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to is I'll get a car cash and then she sells her car and then what have at least one quarter [noise] right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're gonna move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay offs and other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I thought\nBecome they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by the the second week of November everything should be closed do stay close\nTo three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today\nI Would show your trial today and I but I Would\nI Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined\nMake many I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but uh but\nBut the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money but then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and pay off thirty seven thousand dollars worth of debt a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you're not willing to\nDo that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble than\nShe is not willing to\nJoin armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem\n[noise] okay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit you run around and started selling mom was car is not weigh a good way to get mom on board\nHello so let's try that other approach 'cause I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nBut if that and then you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looking at us on our cars and you get her car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this mess cleaned up\nThis is the day Ramsey chef [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I

promotion at work I decided to go back to school and it did pay off I landed the promotional two years ago and now the loans are kicking and then if I would've got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying 'em off sooner but\nI Will I Am get free or two years ago we had our first child and we use\nNo you're not you're a student loan debt he well yeah okay so I'm I'm not that free now much student loan debt they are\nEager and coming up Seventeen months I got to start paying for\nA nice not coming up it's there it's just whether you've got to pay it when you have to pay it so what's your household income\nUh\nIt went from only twenty five when we were both working to Seventy five now my for income\nHow much of a promotion did you get in return for going into ...\nSeventy five now my full income\nAnd how much of a promotion did you get in return for going into debt fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lot of overtime and the path so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent increase my base\nIt didn't show on the paper called your check\nNot yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true ... and I've I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now of four hundred thousand between my four oh one big assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I I'm not terrible but I just want to know\nWhat kind of way gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nI have a hundred thousand in vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollar home\n\n[laughter] [noise] thanks for\nShe's five five five Andy I'm Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nBy cars that were in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a uh the the operations\nOf the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... own all and we'll be rented or on\nWe currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and uh then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your nonprofit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk\nAbout what kind of a you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Will be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the time that they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and show\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an ... interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah keep that separates a ... trait that you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liabilities right with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords couch you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type\nThrough how to do that and I'm I'm not an expert on camp\nInsurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it in my but you wouldn't want to buy their even if they did so huge that you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash wrote what happened in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means in insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\n... and\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff's effort in ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but uh I\nHold harmless is that what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases\nFor sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and I have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all found Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable there's still a level\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still\nAnd ... they're still wobble [laughter]\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean is that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't say thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five you're jumping we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a question and I'm a new is now so I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby and I know that number one than the thousand dollar\nEmergency fund my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment where this job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years on or never happened to act really lucky we've never been laid off you go in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something ... going to\nFind something to do when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed pause ... want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program\nAnd I do that first and a Roth IRA and then I Do it in a ... T S P after that\nIf they're matching I don't think they do but if they're matching you on the ... going to start their with Iraq with the match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate is good to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey what is that\nWhile I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether I should sell my rental property to pay off my I'm ready to wrap for them or and pay off any other dead also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars um I had a credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nOkay so you're dead free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your car's a fifty thousand on bald each or total on both total okay wow and what's your household income uh one thirty\nOkay you got a lot of car and um so what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary I go to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm and the rental\nAnd now my my rental Ohio one takes the and it's worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has worked ... be but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the\nTwo ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right [noise] right and so on you know if we state taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off\nRight and so on you know if we stay taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing more forty fifty grand a year at that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um or you can show the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had a question of whether to to do that and and pay off most of the party much ... pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind for that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nI don't know how to house payment you can catch while they're right okay\nYou know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check that out there and they tell me Gary by a car yeah pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work can't shorter routed me got a ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything I cash flow college then I'd say about my mission where the rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental and pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want to just do it in a savings account the junior college junior colleges do it in their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done\nThen you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ...

I Would not want to pick up the premiums on a half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called the cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money so that whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n[laughter]\nAnd so what if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and my dad's a I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now\nI Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to pay that kind of thing I Know now and then it cuts but you have like I said\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm a question regarding out part of my retirement savings there comes a thing called a pension from my company and that\nOverall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as ... or\n... or ...\nOh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total and I've had you know and\nAnd my question is whether it be kept as a lump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there is a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint in survivor annuity but ... a\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nIt's still love your diet and yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you down the same concept ... so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always type engine lumps arms enroll them to Iowa race and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nAh yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total network the assets house and so forth\nNo yeah well ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire or that ... before that happened\n\nA millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern is because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe yeah ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm a I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now it's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means to live a a a modest lifestyle which uh we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things I think if you can only make\nStupid thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that [laughter]\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things but then you can minimize those things along the way\nIn a way of a modest lifestyle with below you mean I'm no void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize the stupid yeah maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir menu done very very well so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple math on that works to your benefit a at a wild will live if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor sure you come out three hundred grand ahead\nThe question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nThe question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview your for a minute there it's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire [noise]\nOh I Love this millionaire subject is so intriguing\nYou're going to be hearing more from

stay retired it's your money with Jeff ... from from your retirement planning and wealth management starts now [noise]\n\nIf you're retired or even thinking about retiring and the next several years the biggest risk you face now is retiring and they bear market retiring in a bear market could have a devastating impact on your nest egg and because you're no longer earning a paycheck it could cause you to go broke in retirement\nYou're listening to it's your money I'm Jeff Logan thanks for joining us today and I'm here with my co host Linda ... she is the one and we're a how you doing today I'm giving us or how are you good having a good weekend ask them right weekends are great\nLincoln lady she is the only one and we're a how you doing today and I am good having a good weekend ask and great great\nWell let's let's start off with a story about the sequence of returns and you know what it really boils down to is\nNot using lifetime or long term average is to determine how much you're going to make or how long your income is going to last and retirement it really comes down to what are the sequence of returns going to be now I don't know about you wind up but I have not found that first of all\nI I Wish I did because I did I'd be really really allow you be written he was working I mean that made me there ... yes we we\nWe definitely uh I don't have a crystal ball all we have is great hindsight hindsight as they say is twenty twenty the future remains to be seen so let's just give you an example I'm\nJohn and bill are the same age they both have a million dollar save for retirement we'll just use around number ... you know a lot of people have more than that a lot of people have less out whatever it is it's what they were a lifetime and work hard to achieve so that they can use hopefully that's the case that you use it to supplement Social Security and other income\nTo live on and enjoy their ideal retirement life so now these brothers John and bill are going to retire ten years apart John retires during a bull market\nAnd even though he's withdrawing money from his account interestingly his savings and investments are still growing because the market's growing on the other hand bill retires during a bear market now we've seen a few better markets recently haven't we [laughter] and they haven't been easy they've been pretty devastating blow something to the tune of fifty percent downturns the last two that we've had\nAnd what's that combination of stock market losses if you retire like Bill did in a bear market and withdraw the same amount of money as his brother was John was withdrawing\nTwo papers retirement bills and so forth it would end up causing him to run through his entire life savings far too soon we'll have a few examples a little bit later\nI think I Want to hang out with John\nOr you know what I mean the thing is there's a lot of people retire and they get lucky because they retired a good time and they think they're gurus right and some people retire and they think what's wrong with me what's wrong with my advisor what's wrong well the bottom line is they didn't plan\nAnd nobody can really plan for retiring in a bear or a bull market it just kind of ... the markets always right now there are some averages will deal with and again not trying to deal with averages a sequence of returns ruins averages\nBut the bottom line is we don't want you to have a devastating impact on your next day so coming up on today shows we are going to reveal some little known strategies that could protect you no matter what happens next on Wall street and we know\nIt could be anything\nSo let's talk about sequence of returns risk retiring in a bear market um you know we we probably all heard of dollar cost averaging I mean we you know yeah that's right it's a it's the responsible way to plan for retirement right\nYes [laughter] and it shapes sickly includes I'm just being consistent\nUm the the volatility in the market does not matter when you are\nRetiring or when you are growing your assets for retirement because if the market's up you put a certain amount and the market you buy stocks or whatever the value is when the stock market's down you put mark you put money in the market in stocks you buy 'em cheaper obviously\nAnd so bottom line is over a period of thirty or forty years or however long it is that you've managed to save for retirement you average out\nA certain rate of return which by the way is better in general than the average rate of return over the stock market because you're able to buy low\nAnd a while you're gonna be a little by little ... and buy a but the average is actually\nThe rate of return over the stock market because you're able to buy low and a while you're going to be a little by little ... and buy it but the average is actually are better off the longer you do it consistently\nNow that the opposite of that is when you pull money out during retirement and you are taking advantage of the highest in the market like Bill was a John I\nForgot who retired and the market right John John John was the guy that retired that's when you want to hang out with actual yeah ever [laughter] so to John retire and that made money that's right in the in the\nMarket and of course dollar cost averaging really didn't matter or negative dollar cost averaging didn't matter because it was a positive market and so the money kept growing so here's a million dollars while he was using\nThat say four or five thousand dollars a month we're still growing net growing and his brother on the other hand had what was called negative dollar cost averaging because as soon as he retired the market was falling he kept unlocking losses\nAnd what are you calling out at the same time as well so that's a double whammy isn't it\nYeah and and at the same rate I mean you're still using money that you're pulling out of depreciated great I'm In uh in order to live so bottom line is that five to ten year on either side and I think it's probably more\nAnd he just assume that long term average is probably like that that's right we are all too old yet\nIs like just hang in there hanging there will hanging in there isn't as good when you're pulling money out and you know there's um there's there's there's a story I I Want to elaborate a little bit more there is a really good article that really pointed a pointed this picture just really I'm painted the picture\nYeah this is ... let me uh let me just to try to a ... year in a minute killing her\nArticle a few years ago so here's three brothers they all retired at different times the and this is based on actual sequence of returns people had all their money basically in the market surely it was diversified amongst many different uh a mutual funds and stocks but it was a a basically a standard and poor five hundred index model that was very market correlated\nAnd each of the brothers retired at age sixty five with a million dollars okay which they invested according to you know that market correlated asset allocation model that they were told that their broker said don't worry over the long haul it averages so much that you'll be able to take out\nFive thousand dollars a month on the same date every month for the rest of your life and you'll never run out of money well that was their belief here's the results the oldest brother retired January Nineteen Ninety seven now we were in a bull market remember the dot coms well they ended up being dot bombs with their dot coms from it\nAs if the end of July to six two thousand and sixteen is two years ago\nHe now has withdrawn one point one Seventy five million dollars in income and his remaining balance is currently about one point six million dollars well that's pretty sweet [laughter] that is by taking approximately a six percent withdrawal and making slightly less than eight percent average overall the timing was actually worked out pretty good\nNow the oldest brother has approximately two thirds more\nThan is starting a ... that is starting value that's pretty strong\nThese results were approximately um\nYou know a per se as possibly those oracle rate of return for equities and so they they illustrate how if you happen to time it right it it'll work out for you in a long long time now was the oldest brother a market ... who's he just lucky let's that's considered a middle brother he retired three years later in January of two thousand how we remember what happened then right\nAt the Y. two K. scare didn't really blow the mark\nIt up it was the dot bomb the bombed and a bomb very very hard now he didn't make out so well as older brother as a earlier this year and this is a as of last year no no no as actually this was a few months ago this is actually a newer article and I thought so as of this year\nThe middle brother would have run out of money or this is despite the fact that he ripped through only nine nine hundred eighty seven thousand dollars not one point when seven five million like his brother because he had three extra years of you know income so he drew with considerably less than the older brother he didn't even get a million dollars back in sixteen years why because of the sequence\nThere are tens right he had to bear markets right in the middle and he started his retirement on one that was just quickly cover the last rather youngest brother finally retired in two thousand and three that was at the end of that dot bomb ... bust\nHe had five or six years of recovery time and then the market crashed again but that recovery time didn't do him bad\nHe has withdrawn eight hundred Fifteen thousand so far and still has approximately one point six million dollars left so which brother are you going to be do you know\nWell if the stock market has an average bull market of nine years and we are actually nine years as a march of ... getting close to ...\nWell if the stock market has an average bull market of nine years and we're actually\nNine years as a march of ... getting close to half time [laughter]\nI hate to use historical averages ear button you know what are you going to do right now I'm bottom line is is is we really don't know when it's going to come but we do know\nThat if there's one take away from today show if there is just one thing you need to learn\nIs that you need to rebalance your investments not in sixteen different mutual funds but in investments that don't go down when the market goes down now that may be a bond portfolio if you use it right but I'm a little nervous about bonds are going to get into the different products and and I'm like ...\nYeah I Know when does over chopping a bit and um but uh this is something you should put off or thirty or sixty days you know we've had a lot of all ... last couple of months we don't know when the last year was going to drop\nAnd are at this stage of the game it could be too late to recover if this is in fact the time you're planning on retiring so let me show you how you could potentially do more with your investments while reducing risk\nAnd uh we'll make it simple and easy we promised that it will cost you a dime\nIf you save for retirement and you don't want to lose that hard earned money that you work so hard to accumulate the one of the first ten colors on the show right now at five to seven eight or nine o five nine that's five to seven eight or nine o five nine what you learn in just one meeting could literally save your retirement\nYour Social Security benefits will be critical in retirement we talk a lot about that in claiming your benefits need really kind of\nComplicated and have a lot of traps or coming up next normally had it gets and we had ... or ... ... and I'm Jeff Logan on it's your money [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWhether you're already retired are planning to retire just open the window whether you're familiar return of venting their wealth management will help you maximize your income minimize your taxes ... protect what you have more a lifetime you achieve now back to hits your money\n[noise] it's\nTime for that and the weak ways to protect your state and prepare for your future and Jack I'm going to let you take it away [noise]\nRight let's take it away is a ... a protecting your state and preparing for your future you know proper state management really is critical when working toward a more sound unstable financial life I mean that's really the the whole idea about it right from your will to the beneficiaries are two years they plan to your trust\nOr one of the strategies that you need to employ I'm just going to cover a couple of so it might be more like the tips of the week um unfortunately there's a lot of Americans are still having protected themselves or the way they should in fact a there's a study that says only forty percent of adults have a we'll oral living trust in other words they're not they're not taking care of\nTheir stuff for those that they leave behind um they don't have any document in a place at any documentation in place to direct you know where the wishes of weather stuff just to go so first of all we need to start planning for a long life thanks in part to the medical advances and other things we're living longer today\nMeaning you probably need to account for a longer lifespan than previous generations how to\nUh without thoughtful strategies outliving your income is a big part of a protecting your state meeting or it's important to generate lifetime income that will cover the standard of living that you want to live\nUm as we age we also have to realize that are expenses may increase with long term care with the extra health care costs\nWant to live um as we age we also have to realize that our expenses may increase with long term care with extra healthcare costs with inflation and other things it incorporate some financial strategies that will take those things into account\nThen of course there's a um obviously the risk of of of nursing care if we look at what those can cost\nA protecting our state from a massive spend down at a cost right now of Seventy or Ninety seven thousand dollars per year in a nursing home the average semi private room cost about eighty five thousand home health aides or forty nine thousand and just ... assisted living facility cause just under four thousand a month\nI'm currently so consider the future and consider that those are those plans are protecting state from the devastating costs a long term care pretty important\nUm couple of other areas that need to worry about is to review and update your important documents regularly\nNow one way to avoid probate and avoid uh just hassles with leaving your state and assets to who you want how you want when you want is by leaving beneficiary designations on your assets are on your accounts\nIt's important that regularly you take a chance to review\nThose documents ah everything from life insurance to make sure the beneficiaries are who you want\nSometimes I find people that have come in and they have X spouses that are still on their insurance documents when maybe new spouses anew children might be the more appropriate recipient so make sure that those things are reviewed\nAlso if you do not have a beneficiary designation on an asset and your state in Arizona is more than Seventy five thousand dollars it will be most likely subject to probate\nAnd probably is a court process that takes a long time costs a lot of money as a big hassle for the loved ones that you leave behind to mess with that stuff\nSo if you don't have a um [noise] a a directive whether a whale which actually does go to probate or a trust or beneficiary designations on things the court that gets to decide what happens to your stuff\nAnd that's not a very pleasant thought either so review your retirement accounts make sure that uh you can from the beneficiary listings are accurate and updated regularly\nOr also make sure you have adequate life insurance with the correct beneficiaries list list that speaking a life insurance you know what is the amount that you need probably for\nA final benefits a final expenses or something and covered those ah to cover a spouse and things like that are important so have your insurance needs um\nA reviewed and covered as well make sure you have transfer on death's which is a way to do a beneficiary designation on a bank or a brokerage accounts and um\nRemember that a a beneficiaries name on an asset whether it be a T O D which is transfer on death row POV which is called pay on death or I T F which is of interest or or just a plain old beneficiary on\nIt's whatever you get you get yeah it's a game that even write whenever you lock in that payment it doesn't go backwards at least not yet they have a medical backwards I Hope they don't know but uh yeah bottom line is the same or can go up if you're stuck continuing to work right\nThat's true so security benefits either stay the same or go up they don't go down and that offsets a lot of that pressure you're gonna have to put on\nTo your your other investments that if you get a a a good professional thorough investment Adel analysis to make sure that you are properly diversified make sure you go ahead and make sure that Social Security analysis is in place because you need to know\nHow much of a gap you need to make up for you or what we call paychecks mailbox money that comes in every month that's what ... call mailbox money\nIs those checks that come in every month that you can count on is a Social Security maybe you have a pension too but there's probably for like most people and you've save for retirement you

going to reveal some little known strategies that can help protect you no matter what happens next and Wall Street so\nThe first one we talked about already ... while we were off off the air is spending conservative like if you use to spending money that's going to be kinda tough for people\nYeah that's kind of like that or that's the cruelly nobody wants to drink [laughter] you know like I don't like that flavor spending conservative with what you're spending ... if you that doesn't mean necessarily be frugal and not buying anything when it might mean is\nFlying coach and worry about you know for about a third of the ... ... no I Would never recommend why legion but I Would recommend get the exit route\nGosh you know for about a third of the ... ... no I Would never recommend fly legion but I Would recommend get the exit row shoot there's leg room back there and you'll get a get on the plane or you just don't get free watch by your lunch when you land or bring it with you\nUm you know some of the other thing you know some people love these are real expensive a river brokers is just what you can still go down the down you about something that costs half as much there are times when you can maybe still have fun not spend quite as much money but if you're you know\nWe have a couple of clients that we have a difficult time with\nOur we have a lot and I'm not saying necessary that that's the catch all but if you have too much at risk and if you are needing to take money out when the markets down then maybe you haven't allocated properly diversified properly if you need to spend conservatively that might be the only choice you have but it's probably because you didn't set aside that\n... though the wish list right and and the thing is is we we have advocated\nMy attitude is I don't want to have any money in the market that I cannot afford to lose\nMore weight on or not spin for your by now if what that might mean is you create an income plan that actually guarantees more income than you than the bare necessities some people say well this is my I don't have to move under a bridge money maybe it's five or six thousand a month I'll just guarantee\nEnough on my retirement accounts to guarantee that much money and then we'll just live on the rest will you know if you have another five or six thousand you like to spend out of those other accounts\nYou could be like one of the you could be like the middle brother who ended up running on the right last year or this earlier this year right sixteen Eighteen years and he might be expecting a third of your retirement you didn't get all this money back\nSo you don't want to be that person either\nAnd uh that just I guess underscores the you know good strategies require good budgets a little bit of forward thinking and if you do want that fund money to be guaranteed them put it in a guaranteed account and plan for it so you don't have to live quite so conservatively frugally or when that comes so one of the things that we do um\nMy think here and you talked about the bonds\nWell building a bond ladder is is one thing you could do I you know I prefer just because the income because of the um [noise]\n... interest rates are rising the bond prices go down if if you don't have bonds coming due every month or every six months if you don't ladder them exactly right ...\nYou may have to liquidate a bond at a loss and I'm not sure I like that as much as I liked the idea that insurance companies use like a forty year ladder bond portfolio and their buns come and do every day they can get your money with outlaw says let's take on that interest rate risk annuities are backed by a bomb matter\nNow everybody sometimes that the word annuity offends people or I hate annuities he should too\nUm but I Love annuities I think they are one of the safest uh vehicles out there for retirement and they're all different types for different purposes so you have to be very clear on what the purpose is for that annuity\nBut the fixed ones are insured secured and guaranteed several levels of guarantee insured secured and their principal protected you cannot lose principal in them like you can in a bond insurance company takes on that risk for you so much\nEven though it's conservative I'm Still making money on on a new and he when the market goes that I participate in that that game when the market goes down I created a new floor zero is my hero and not go below that and then when the market starts to go back up again right I'll start making money again\nAnd we thought we saw someone portfolios break even or lose money last year but we also saw fixed index annuities which are ... are secured by bonds make over ten percent routinely last year\nThis year but we also saw fixed index annuities which are ... are secure buy bonds make over ten percent routinely last year with no risk so when's the last time a bond made over ten percent any er well it's been a long time since we've seen that kind of interest rate and uh we haven't seen that kind of a price increase except in a\nHuge interest rate\nFalling market which we had for a short time about eight or ten years ago in the market was crashing we add interest rates coming down pretty hard\nBut I think those days are over and I think we need to rethink or yeah how how secure that a bond letter is now now he now don't get me wrong I Love bon letters and I've loved them for Thirty years I just turned changing a little out of favor and now that we're going into what\nMany experts including Jeff unlike and Bill Gross people that know about bonds billionaires made by bonds\nUm they say we're going into a bond there market I don't think we want to be in the ...\nAnd you can continue to do what you've been doing you could be very surprised by the results\nRight ... ... you know I I also I think that um you know ... you just have to avoid selling a loss is actually the bottom line and if you can avoid selling losses your money's going to last longer for sure", "show_name": "Doug Stephan's Good Day", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "28"}
