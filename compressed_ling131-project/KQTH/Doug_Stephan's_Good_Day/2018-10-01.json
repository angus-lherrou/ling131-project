about the TV report or the numbers that Lew watched Christine was they were aluminum you're right Jennifer where they\nHave [laughter]\nChristine forward and Brett Kavanaugh twenty million people watching them as they testified last week that's higher than the Nineteen media new tuned in for James Comey's hearing the numbers don't include the people who watched on their phones their computers that sort of thing\nCNN says that its biggest live video days since President Trump's inauguration eight million live starts on his website and\nI tell you I was using the and then go in my purse because I was I had to go buy some banks and stuff for the wedding and that I was in the past weekend and I was listening as I was walking to the store at one of my headphones in my ear like a total idiot but I had to I wanted\nTo hear it a lot of people did yeah people were and it was so funny 'cause I was in bed sick and I was watching it on a I guess it was NBC's coverage and Megan Kelly for it\nPeople did yeah people were and it was so funny 'cause I was in bed sick and I was watching it on a I guess it was NBC's coverage and Megan Kelly for whatever reason they had her on a panel and she was like you know no one's watching this and she kept saying it over and over like no one cares about this like everyone's at work no one's watching this\nI saw a ... right like why are you saying that because you're on live t._v. first well ... that's the people are watching you feel like losers because they're like one of ten people watching it was so weird that's like me saying well you know we're not going to do a very good radio show today right now I'm listening\nI bought a let's see I Can't understand really being wasting time I did not watch\nThese I get a bit little here and there are enough to make a conversational on the air on friday but\nUh there's nothing about this this is just uh I I Know but a lot of you if you are very close to it for whatever the reason a lot of women are very passionately involved in this woman and her story\nI feel badly for her frankly and it has nothing to do with the event as much as it does with the spectacle\nOf the fact that she had the courage to get up I don't think she's an ax grinder I think that something happened whether it was with Kevin or not I find it interesting to note that are that the senator from Arizona\nWho's pretty much put the brakes on sixty minutes last night was named flake right Jeff like uh-huh like yeah I thought he was credible came across will measured interesting he was supposed to deliver a speech today in Boston\nAnd they changed the venue because they were worried about bombs and attacks on him\nI don't know where we are in this country\nBut I mean right now people would want to attack him he's kind of see being seen as a hero of the ... college\nChanged the venue because of attacks\nThat he had watched him over the weekend he got but he was at some I don't know what kind of festival he with that but something that was definitely more liberal crowd and he went up and thought he was going to get himself a nice reaction and he got booed like a lot so um yeah I wouldn't be so sure that he's being looked at as a hero\nPublic service does not pay anymore much doesn't\nIt doesn't even live out he was going to be a hero but I I well I don't know whether he I don't think he did it for that reason gender I didn't I didn't know the guy but I watched his body is is failing\nAt least ... he's ... he's gonna primary tromp and twenty twenty mark my words it's not a Megan Kelly production he's gonna primary Trump he's a he that's why he's leaving the Senate\nAnd part what part of the reason why leaving the Senate is because he didn't have the votes to get reelected so he would have probably be gotten beat by a Republican challenger but he wants to run against Trump and that he in case they are the two that have been the the outspoken critics although you have kids voted with Trump like Ninety three percent of the time I voted with him here\nRight well there's ... stance in a manner of speaking yeah\nIt's just more delayed delayed delayed but we'll see we'll say anyway TV news you're right yes yes so some new premieres this week and I'll tell you about those first 'cause it is that the exciting lead and I make a comment\nBefore you get a I watched CBS last night looking for my favorite Sunday night programs from last year yeah there's there's nothing I watch a little bit of sixty minutes and there was some new show that was ridiculous about God and whether he says is\nA God called me or something gun or exit me everybody yeah yeah and the only thing I saw and I didn't\nWatch the whole thing because I found it so annoying the premise so annoying\nI rented

it's funny you say that I was just reading a headline apparently so the stock took a big as loss on friday as this was being speculated that he was going to be removed\nHowever now they actually say he's got a that that Tesla had a stock surge Eighteen percent in pre market trading today so I don't know I guess why 'cause they're Abby's out\nI think it's because people just bought a lot of stock wallet dropped them and I think I think [laughter]\nThat's what I Would guess but so\nThe the word is on the street if you talk to Nick\nAre mothers who was our car guy or other people who know their way around the car world\nOr the people that General Motors and Ford and Chrysler all want to buy this because they all know the technology to some of your costs them billions to come up with a there

it's a fabulous there tight or the electronic stuff is fascinating car drives itself if you want it to a it's a it's fascinating but anyway it's um [noise] uh this guy's got a few\nProblems I think and they are personal problems business suffers because that because he's so motivated he's manic this guy is manic yeah up twenty four hours a day can't sleep and so he started trying to take pills support him to sleep and so he smokes pot to relax himself or whatever it is that he does\nAnd it's gotten in the way of all the things that he started space act\nAnd so he smokes pot to relax himself or whatever it is that he does and it's gotten in the way of all the things that he started space that\nWell I think ... and that was going to do but yeah I I think that he's I think he's gotten to the point where he\nI don't know if he was under any type of influence when he made those tweets but he was he was not happy with the way the company was going and he ... it seemed like a simple tweet he tweeted that he was on and take the company back private again\nAnd the FCC was all over that it dropped the stock and then the stock went up and you know it it's it's who would've ever thought that tweet could bring you you know could you could lose your job you\nBetter be careful about which has a A N and social media man that's the way that the world is right\nNow is yep right All right let's let's go one step further thinking about investments in general\nVictoria you're an investor start with a hundred bucks roll the dice make fifty percent on your money that first year good huh to feel good about it sure you got a hundred and fifty bucks now\nThings are going great role again this time your investment loses like test the fifty percent then instead of having a hundred and fifty bucks you got Seventy five but remember you started last year when the hundred mhm so now you're down fifty percent\nAnd so you think okay I'm In a roller dies you gotta get Seventy five Seventy\nFive bucks I'm going to maybe get twenty five percent out of my money so then even if you get Seventy five times twenty five you're still under a hundred bucks\nAnd so you're behind that's for those of us who have taken chances sometimes you're lucky you know you see those big gains any wow I'm going to get into that this is a particular if your for example look at marijuana stocks\nThey're up seven hundred percent in two three months so people that oh let's put our money and that well if you are a little more conservative this is an example\nOf what somebody else has done these were two sisters by the way these are real life stories two sisters so the first one they both ... and a hundred bucks they had a little fun with it they decided they were going to invest in see what they got out of it so I think they serve more than a hundred bucks but it's just\nFor the purposes of telling the story so the other sister a starts at the same hundred bucks invested gets ten percent the first year\nOr so she got a hundred and ten bucks or next year same investment went up a little bit so she got ... percent so now she's got a hundred and twenty two bucks Thirty years you get six percent so she got a hundred and thirty bucks but um\nHello after three years you get a hundred and thirty bucks and her sister has Ninety [laughter]\nSo maybe that's an old word to the wise yeah all of us like to\nFiddle around when we all see these big games like buying a lottery ticket though\nSometimes it's good for a few\nBut believe me by the time it is a big stock purchase you're not getting it because he insiders always are the ones that get the IPO's especially the people who are investors were Goldman Sachs or ... or whatever it is they're getting they're getting the best buy into the apple 'cause they're getting their first by the apple\nSo if those of you who have money set aside for your retirement or thinking about this perhaps that's food for thought\nOr the um the putting money aside the national library of medicine\nOf focusing on the population age of our country\nEighty five an overpopulation and our country\nFor our country eighty five an overpopulation and our

you know I'm someone who you can talk to and they're also going to be doing stuff the truck events\nThat's when they collect donations and that's because they say that they recently partnered up with
