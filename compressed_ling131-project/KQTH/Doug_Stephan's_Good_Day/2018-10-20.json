I feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice\nRolling in financial base university I feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return least car dealership or at this point I just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nYour car back that you owe money on our son to lease on that's effectively\nA voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb\nBecause they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it\nAnd the other and on repossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the difference goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the leash to yes you're being leased\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the title of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off on the line when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nSo the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what strike by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that\nTo KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\nSo four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down and the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will sell it for a ... a lot so the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession\nAnd so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no diversity is telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we've been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be intentional even with the little things there is one thing

yeah there's you know but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand hours between now and then to use it in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at the ... a student loan you will of lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child helping you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and uh they gave me the boy 'cause I have a lot of girls close yeah\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a day room she was always a AAA eight to five five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you I'm good how are you they better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchased our life insurance and we got part permanent impart term\nAnd of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nA ... about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and said we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about whole law permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you\nDo is it still bad shall we still didn't get the term I don't know you doesn't know much about\nDave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest sounds real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances\nTo use life insurance as an investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhen which so unique new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you have a life insurance salesman okay they're selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then that money we were because it was like three hundred dollars a month which I Do watch 'em and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed and mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class wasn't yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things either this guy's a lawyer or he's ignorant but [laughter] he's a family friend who's in the\nUm actually one of our friends just apparently gave them our number ... than for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I don't know which is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy was until we were AB with hand\n[laughter] why don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything you soldier\nOkay [laughter] okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this guy really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like what we're going to do I'm In the end of this week\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... number for some reason hurt\nUsing life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this case someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically\nUm the people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote\nYou after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out in these even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay\nOnly the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years\nI keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever not did get a horrible\nNorthwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than Fifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops or\nIt's about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nWhether it's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance your insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance around any of it that's the other a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the Dave Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's ... it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker ... you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air\nWith ... with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance you can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state formation foreign nationwide in Asia or Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide in and out but um and they're both good guys I like both of them it's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plant\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace 'cause I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occurred\nOn them home with a mortgage\nSo we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up times and then down times\nEnjoy to not have a ... named country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just ... I think I Would probably have an anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us and Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey Shia\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping you could give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free or at least we paid our house shock yeah the way to go\nYeah we're happy about that a decided to you know fell off and investments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that\nOh the people's money you're low interest that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great but you know hey the good\nI have is we were able to sell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar suit that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a few about about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing the amount of money and the market and I'm five foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy rental properties outright mhm and\nWell I flip homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money by rental properties outright mhm and a and B that and maybe diversify a little more ... than I wanted to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yeah it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know\nBut you you put put a renter and how much they go out on you [laughter] and so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national fact I've got a bunch of it um mosque by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return the ... minus expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return\nI are are not casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less and some of it okay but uh I our our total what the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the real estate on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean it is um you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy or a broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on them and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do they\nGet our question I'm sure they might play point with a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand [laughter]\nI have I can get five home mhm uh I'm all in a hundred thousand each ... now so I don't I own them out like all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else said wanting to buy three and four fifty percent\nYeah well I don't ... you know I don't I don't think I Know your answer there on a leveraging I\nI'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I Want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three bedroom two bath for about a hundred maybe a hundred and twenty ... single family home yeah\nI'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range in you and do three\nThree one fifty one Seventy five is right in there or rather than five ones and

going to live my life because there's just too much negativity there's just way too much cried going on out there and you know what there is I mean I Want to be informed yes when I read something you hear about something my damned or gets up a little bit like how can somebody say that\nWhy would they even go down that road are nuts well these people are nuts in fact would they need to be congratulated an organization\nCalled and you're going to love this\nDeep Texas ramp what do you eat hold it what are you eating over there you didn't bring me any what is that all about any way off base here it's called the Texas ramp project\nThe Texas ramp project you can go to it after you hear this story just to be inspired motivated excited like something good is happening in the world Texas ramps\nDot O. R. G. go Texas ramps\nDot O. R. G. so I heard about this organization and here again the the goodness of people kind of gets buried in the everyday types of news and reporting but here's an organization that really has put at the forefront the fact\nThat if somebody is not able to get out of their home because they lack a ramp whether it's a young\nChild or an older individual or a a veteran of of the wars\nAnd they're just they can't so very thought was let's build freedom\nFor the homebound\nAnd this there are caption on their website says have you ever changed a person's life in a single day\nThe Texas ramp project does it hundreds of times a year what do they do they build real ... wheelchair ramps for disabled or elderly people who can't afford to buy one they say in a few hours on a Saturday morning we give these folks the freedom to leave their home again\nThe home where they want to remain but who steps\nHave imprisoned them so I think as as as silly as maybe some people you know it's just a ramp you know what the heck did can't they go to a Home Depot and get some they want you know maybe their budget precludes them from doing it maybe they just don't have the wherewithal and they're dealing with other things physically so these individuals'\nHas stepped up and stepped out and pony up to the plate\nNow I can say to people who come into our office and they sit across the table from us we run the smart money master plan we analyze their current positions\nWe look at their annuities we look at their insurance as their life insurance their disability their long term care coverages we dissect all of that we put a plan together\n\nWe show them the power of zero give them the book the power of zero run the trailer the power of gives the movie's not out yet and they think to themselves mark thank you for sharing this with us we don't we want to be ahead of this\nWe don't want to be reacting we want to be proactive so we encourage you give us a call\nYou want to see the movie get on the movie list you want to make an appointment you say mark I can't even wait for the movie I Want to know what I Need to do today I've been listening to the show you've been thrown out a lot of facts and figures and you're saying\nThe financial sue nominee is coming we are spending a trillion more than what the government is taking in\nHow long can this madness last as long as there are people in Congress that's how long it will last\nReally as long as they continue to put at the forefront their own wellbeing their reelection\nYou stress and all the negativity here on the radio the candidates against one another it's cut throat as mean spirited it's just\nIf folks who is not about you so what so the purpose of me even saying all this is you need to take your own financial well being into your own hands and you do that by getting the phone in your hand\nYou need to take your own financial wellbeing into your own hands and you do that by\nGetting the phone in your hand and calling us at two nine six four four six for\nMaking an appointment folks what we do eventually\nYou buy something there's a product or a concept or a strategy that you say mark that makes sense we need to redeploy dollars we need to reposition dollars we need to start what we call income shifting\nBecause mark we believe now you're right taxes are on sale they are at historically low rates so let's start moving the money now so that down the road to government doesn't Jack\nUp the rates and charges Moore you pick up the phone call she called me on my cell phone you want to argue this point with me I'm happy to do that\nBecause folks the Math Doesn't lie we told you last week in fact you Google that write us debt clock dot ORG\nTalk about sobering talk about really putting the numbers behind what I'm Talking about here\nA sovereign debt crisis is on the way and the government refuses to do anything about it don't look if you tell me I don't like what the government's doing then don't agree with them and don't applaud them by sticking your head in the sand along with them\nPlease don't do that have enough\nGuts to pick up the phone and say more I Want to make a difference in my life and in my family's life tell me what I Need to do this is a business that we are in a business of advice look at where the economy's going look at\nHow they're spending is out of control\nWhat mark what do we do I had this conversation last week with a couple who\nCame in and it was very easy for me to step them through the mental gymnastics of saying look if you were twenty five years old or you're Twenty years old you're probably going to be in a zero percent tax bracket the the lowest bracket you've ever been in and they're probably thinking themselves will Mark I'm not twenty five on\nSixty five or Seventy but they know either their grandkids or other kids that are in their twenties what a great message that they can take somebody imagine this\nSomebody here's my message they say they pick up the phone and they're calling young people saying I Need to take you out for a cup of coffee because I Want to tell you how you can protect yourself from what's coming so I had this conversation I said imagine they're in their lowest lowest bracket ever is it fair\nFor the government to say we will allow you to postpone the tax that you owe today which is oh by the waves zero\nAnd push it out to where you're sixty five or Seventy or Seventy five whatever they end up whatever age they ended up retiring at and now you're in a forty or fifty percent bracket and just just on the surface Tristan\nIs that fair but you know what people are doing it all the time they are\nConstantly doing it because the message from Wall street the message from our Congress the message from the four oh one K. providers and so on and so forth is\nDiffer differ differ\nBut look you're taking you the listener\nCare old you are you're taking on all the risk by putting money into those qualify plans and kicking it\nDoesn't hear old you are you're taking on all the risk by putting money into those qualify plans and kicking it out to eat what I can conceive of is going to be a much higher tax bracket\nYou're postponing the inevitable does it make sense to stop the madness today\nAnd put the money someplace where you pay the tax and get it over with and then all the gain all the girls all those accounts are going to earn are going to be yours tax exempt tax free\nSee on the surface that sounds magnificent doesn't it doesn't that sound like a winning game plan a winning scenario to us it does\nBut I have to tell you most people they hear that message and they continue\nTo max out they're qualified plans are for one case there for all three peas they continue just to keep putting more and more money because they like that deduction which you know now listening to the show is simply a postponement of the inevitable\nThe vehicles that we encourage you to put your money's into by painted stack city and getting it over with when you go to pull that money out none of that money none of those dollars show up on your ten forty form we think that's pretty magnificent\nNot only does

for me to start shifting\nOf those retirement qualified dollars start paying the tax start getting a tax paid for today and shifting them into vehicles were when I go to pull all that money out I pay zero taxes let's explore that together I Can't make a blanket statement over the airwaves\nI did a couple of months ago and I continue to even in our office and I will do that right now is that what if you could earn an additional thirty to fifty percent on a guaranteed basis in retirement than what you projected what you're on a progression to make right now\nWould that be of interest to you thirty to fifty percent more mark are you kidding me of course I Would call you in a heartbeat okay a heartbeat about five just passed and me saying all that are so give me a call\nYou're kidding me

time come in and we're not going to bite you gotta leave with all kinds of goodies we're going to talk more about long term care life insurance\nAnd annuities\nAnd you want to make sure you have done the very best job possible when it comes to ensuring your life\nThere are many people will say now mark you look I've heard this ... whole life insurance I shouldn't I I've heard bad things about it I Googled it it says it's a lousy investment it's a horrible well what I say about ten minutes ago was\nLife insurance is not an investment however it has about thirty different benefits in comparison to maybe your four o one K plan or your IRA or your brokerage account\nWhich doesn't have all those thirty different investment or those thirty different attributes so that's why it's important if what you knew to be true wasn't when what you want to know I Hope you want to know today will\nMark if I come into the office you're just going to try and sell me a whole life insurance no I'm not\nGoing to have a count of a conversation about what you currently have in place and if we can put you in a better position if we can read deploy the dollars you're currently spending over here and move them to over here by the way I'm using hand signals writes us from here to here\nAnd it's more efficient for you and your family and you create an additional twenty or twenty five maybe even even thirty different benefits\nWould that be important to you\nWhen I bring people face to face with the amount of benefits a four one K. plan or a four oh three B or\nAn a a a an IRA provide think about it just offhand what you're getting ready to return you get a postponement slash differ oh\nOkay well let's see\nWhat if you become disabled no that plan stops what if you die there is no death benefit so there's there's only a limited number of benefits into it with those vehicles now granted\nQualified plans under a risk the guidelines are creditor protected or life insurance always when you stack 'em up side by side I remember one time and I wrote down the list the thirty different things\nBut I didn't title it I said would you like all these things in the next thing you purchase or join will absolutely those are those are incredible those are marvelous I said well it's life insurance and they look they ran like screaming down the street\nIt didn't make sense to me it's like you like all the benefits I just wonder if I called it my favorite thing I call it a peanut butter and jelly sandwich would that be more palatable it would be\nBut we have to at the end of the day tell you look this is what it is this is what annuities will do for you let's take longevity risk off the table right now let's stop the madness\n\nThe man is going to happen I have an article here and by

happen is going to come and what you say is inevitable\nThe madness the man this isn't gonna stop as long as we have a Congress that refuses to look at the national debt as our biggest national security problem\nIt is but you know what it's not politically expedient politically expedient for them to say this\nWhy is because it's going to require them to say let's lower the debt ceiling let's increase taxes let's cut some of the benefits that Social Security Medicaid and Medicare or providing\nHow well is that going to sit with their constituency a not very well at all so they refused to

saying is true how can these insurance companies\nHow will they fared during what you're saying is going to be a Great Depression worse than the great depression let me tell you this insurance

unless there's some annuities perhaps in those accounts [noise] X. oriole science\nIs not an individual stocks and bonds it just isn't it is\nInherent it's built in to why and what insurance cut why

weight because I don't know that I ...\nI Know I don't think we can Bible for an hour and a half dollars please call in and help us all you don't know me high what's going on in society today are\nNow tell us what's going on with your car today 'cause wage got all the answers and yeah so when you when you if you got people that say I didn't make a cross country trip that come in and they said we're going to check the check the car we're going to make this cross country trip\nWhy does the number one thing you tell them first before anything else what's the number one thing is is the most important for them to look at\nUs not necessarily the thing to look at what the thing I tried to tell them do not bring it in the friday before the weekend you're leaving 'em well yeah because it's generally not\nAn oil change and an air filter its you know you generally have something more serious going on most of the time I'm not all the time and do you get people to do that if I can see how you know everybody's everybody's pretty much guilty about wait until the last second sometimes you get so hectic in life you're just forget that things the basic checked out\nUm but the safety is when you run across road tires tire pressures\nWiper blades because it may not be running ... may not be raining here when it's going to be random somewhere that's right they have rain like ours and they don't want those wife are always work or for your safety and possibly for your car safety her if you want to call it that a gallon of drinkable water or that way if you do get stressed\nThat's why probably always work uh for your safety and possibly for your car safety her if you want to call it that a gallon of drinkable water\nOr that way if you do get stranded or you've got something to drink either car gets a little hot and you don't have any cooler leaks and once it cools down you might be able to top off the cooling system if it's for some reason to run a little hot I'm\nAlways want to have a good flashlight you always want to plan\nGod I'm going to let you plan my next trip I Am ready\nI'm ready to go and I got up and ... all\nOne person that where you're going oh boy on if you don't want anybody else to know don't tell them so much the secret\nI got to tell you that that's a good one because my daughter my oldest daughter she and all of her friends decided to go to Mexico one weekend a they were about I don't know Twenty years old and they were about seven girls in a jeep they went down to rocky point for the weekend come Monday morning none of them showed up for work\nA couple of them didn't show up for school and my daughter didn't show up for work and that was really unlike her you know so they called mom she wasn't living at home they called mom and said hey where's Valerie mom said hey I haven't got a clue so I went to where she was living there was no one home and I called her dad and I said\nAnd he said oh she didn't tell you they went to Mexico for the weekend well guess what she didn't come home\nSo I ended up we called a a local congressman's office you helped us out down there and help get somebody out to look for um [noise] and they were stranded on a road on Mexican side of the border flat tire energy seven girls was a bikini top on\nThat was not the optimum thing so\nLike I tell you guys tell mom and mom where you're going ... mom doesn't like the panic that ... hour I I think we are going to be heading for a about two minutes we're going to be enforced I should give me a couple more things here weight that you think people need to know more than\nOne morning and Morse\nSerpentine belt on your engine Landrieu notes are probably the most critical to outta sight outta mind and nothing ... expense yeah they can be some of these vehicles anymore like the big diesel trucks you have to pull the engine corn fan off a two to three hours to do this job it's not something you're going to want to talk on the side of the road\nI think you're going to want to have help with that though right\nYeah it takes special tools to do so many so you're not going to be able to change 'em like they used to back in the day where you can carry a handful of tools and fix your vehicle on the side of the road\nI got to tell you that that's one thing I Love about the fifty five Chevy that we have you could practically crawl in and sit down and that thing have lunch and work on the car at this I mean it's I don't know how you guys work on these little cars with no base\nYeah my technicians come in different sizes\nSo and then the electric vehicles coming out can be as there too because\nBoy if you cut that wrong liar\nIf you're going to have some pretty kinky here for quite a lot of time you know you don't want to cut the rough fire in an electric vehicle\nOh no no no you have to have 'em just take some special classes the new out of work on these vehicles special gloves special tools you guys had an electric vehicles how we do have a couple\nCouple uh we don't for say specialize on it and I'm so much to have a cup of customers we grandfather in and help out a I was going to bring up the fact we have a customer whether it's ... previous\nThat's used to getting fifty miles to the gallon any calls up saying hey I'm getting about thirtieth max I'm would chase it down to an oxygen censor unbelievable gained twenty miles per gallon by changing his oxygen sensor\nAnd and is there any other type of car you could think of it that would happen to\nThat's how much these computer controlled cars are doing you know require everything working fine tune you know they're not precise\nI just don't I to me there's so much more than just being able to plug it in somewhere and let it read it I mean I don't know how you ... ... do you have to know what the coach me and\nI mean that's just that you plug in vehicle and um you go to your shopping they plugged in it in and they gave you this code is like a symptom that's that's like saying hey I got a I got a pain in my my elbow doc I'm I think it's my\nMy funny bone 'cause I'm not laughing anymore [laughter] you know and then they he says well you know that's a good symptom and the code for that is your elbow hurts but it turns out\nAnd you know and then they he says well you know that's a good symptom and the code for that as your elbow hurts but it\nTurns out that it's more in depth you know it turns out you might have\nBone problems or whatnot so it's just basically a gateway down a\nLike your family tree when you look at family trees and you see all down here and ate down you're related there it's kinda like looking at that that it just some ... is an input\nThis code can branch off to be a hundred things this cold can branch off to be ten things can branch off to be five things I'm an every step you do require testing sometimes hooking up a scan tool sometimes waiting for the vehicle to cool off and then get hot again and vice versa\nI'm that's why it's getting very technical out there and they predict that eventually\nAuto auto repair is going to be about as expensive as going to the doctor\nYou know I was thinking that too it's it's how\nHow do you know when you something goes wrong in the car you're going it's you know I might as well just get rid of the car how where does that break point you say you know what it is just not even going to be worth fixing person forget it go find them now I mean how do you tell someone that he then\nYeah it it's hit or miss you know we've got to talk about a jeep we had it in a er last radio show I talked about a jeep where we talked about whether we're going to do so under heads or do a complete engine\nAnd getting to that point um you know I can take anywhere from three to five hours to come up with a conclusion or a a really good diagnosis\nUm we you know we we take pride in these vehicles that you bring us um we look at these vehicles as if they're our grandmothers so and\nYou know you bring an end to me I we don't judge vehicles I'm what I'm getting down to is\nWe have ... we have a V. six gee that's going to require two cylinder heads so you so you've got the made an approximation\nWith all the necessary components it kind of plan for the worst and hope for the best and then you give them the other option of an engine replacement\nFor five you look at the mileage on the vehicle you look at the value on the vehicle if it was running in shape what would you get for it if you sold it so there is a tremendous amount of factors we take into play um we have some people that have been left vehicles\nFrom um people that have passed away to wear sentimental value is priceless yeah and people will\nPeople will be willing to spend their hard earned money keeping that Nineteen eighty two Toyota cold a Corolla you know I can see and going down the road it's paid for it's only going to require about five thousand bucks to keep it going\nI'm sentimental values there you can get up in the morning and see your vehicle they're so warm and fuzzy inside\nI could see that that because you know we've got a Seventy seven GMC pick up that that my father in law bought brand new and my husband says it will never leave the house I mean this is our truck that says the family you know so I\nJust I've got a Ninety GMC that went with my mom and sat down and ordered way back in Nineteen eighty nine it's brand new and I I have that vehicle today with two hundred and Seventy eight thousand on it it's just all four engines and it's in your heart is in you know I Can't get rid of it would have to dig a big hole and put that truck in there with me and you'll\nBe you'll be buried right outside of it right inside of it so I was looking the other day um I have a look at how much a Chevy or order books from back in the fifties when he didn't really go\nI was looking the other day um I have a book at home it's a Chevy um [noise]\nOrder books from back in the fifties when you didn't really go and they didn't build a million cars put them on a lot and helped somebody comes to buy it you know they you went in and you looked at a big book and you looked at the interior that you might want and you looked at the ... area that you might want and then you put the whole thing together and they're little template\nI'd never I until I saw that book I had no idea that how they use to\nHow they used to go and buy cars I ... I always thought people just ... you know but I thought that was interesting that I mean how do you how do you\nWhat happens if he didn't like it when it came in I guess you already built that that was yours\nYou know but you could put anything any any one of those template they would put on there for you but yeah once you bought it that's your vehicle but I thought what a great way to do it because it will not wasting all the parts and what happens to these cars that have been sitting there for sixteen years and nobody's bottom and you know so I I just thought that was kind of a neat way to\nTo save on on some of our resources not to build so many I Would love to see some of the on um automotive manufacturers kind of going back to a little bit of that maybe not that drastic but a little bit of\nI think it's in Cuba or have you seen all the cool classic cars in Cuba no should check it out sometime bunch it's like going back in the fifties\nI Love it here in cars I Love that it was awesome have you ever looked at any of the old um commercials\nThe old car commercials um know oh you do that you need to Chevy I think we had some in the best car commercials back in the fifties and sixties and the way they would sell a car is just amazing to me you know they would\nHave some of these actors and actresses lounging in the cars and driving through clouds and I mean it ... it was really cool to see some of these old and coming from the world that I come from when we go to a big uh conferences with the with the uh we you know they'll always have some of those really cool and hold things to show us in one of them they have a virtual\nFuture car commercial back in Nineteen sixty five\nAnd they were ordering drinks out of the car and they were telling the car where to go and I thought well were there yeah yeah we are there we are there and you know I get people always ask me do you think we'll ever get to the Jetsons you know do a flying cars I literally will\nUm I don't know if it'll be in my lifetime and I think at least in my my youngest kid and\nI'm hoping that make them I covered crafts we can actually crushing the people oh man you might be fun and regal\nBumper cars no I wouldn't be fine because I'd be I'd be the first one out there crashing now higher up so I always listen for that I was just up in Phoenix\nI got to got to feel touching sit inside a card that is fully electric fully autonomous three D printed a reasonable and you know no it was really cool it was really\nThree D printed so if you go out and you hit somebody and you got a big didn't aside you just just pull out your print is another one printed out\nWow and and they're\nIt's happening right now there's a car company up in Phoenix it's building on um I I saw it actually first at the national renewable energy lab and then Phoenix local motors is is building um right now so I ... I mean pretty soon what are we going to need to do\nYou know there's there's no doubt on my way when I drive past that is right about oh who didn't do it I Can't think of you know but the future is here I think that our parents probably told us down ever happen that'll never happen I I don't know how old you are but you probably didn't you probably don't remember the seventies oil embargo\nParents probably told us to el never happen that'll never happen I I don't know how old you are but you probably didn't you probably don't remember the seventies oil embargo and watching people standing on the street\nCorner Winfrey protest sign all I was watching a team in the fall guy [laughter] always the aviator as well I was on a man ...\nOh man I'm so old you know I'm so old Jerry helped me uh yeah you guys All right so let's think what else I don't know kind of\nWhere you think the next five years where we're going to go with the internal combustion engine I mean do you do you I think on automobile manufacturers are not going to stop building internal combustion engines I think we're still gonna sail what do you think [noise]\nOh I think it's probably about another [noise]\nTwenty years where I think we're going to see the majority of the vehicles out they're fully electric\n'em and [noise] you know what I what I'm surprised about is how what is a mess and all this produced a of corn ethanol ethanol [laughter] and uh you know why we don't we don't do more of that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Doug Stephan's Good Day", "city": "Tucson", "day": "20"}
