Victoria\nForty four out of\nThe hour an hour and a DJ V. program joining us is Christian gardener who's the director of consumer products and markets for members fear and this conversation ought to be something we don't have to wait for a special time even though October has been for the last number of years breast cancer awareness month\nThere's a lot of new information from him as fear a showing that women who go for an annual breast cancer screenings generally assume that doctors are familiar with their prior mammogram images interesting Victoria Jones and I were talking about this off year she makes her business to go\nTo the same hospital all the time because she knows they have her records\nApparently this is a big problem Kristen why is it that these records are not easily transferable\nWell morning and thank you for having me\nAnd you know if it's a really great question and a lot of women are doing what your color is doing and\nTrying to make sure that they're seeing at the same for lighter to make sure that their record their their that unfortunate challenge and health care and that but those aren't always freely able to communicate with one another they can be on different system\nThey may have different machines that your image of there and on and so it is it is a challenge for them to communicate and times especially when it comes down to the breast imaging because the files are so large\nThat they often are dependent on women driving from center to center to actually gather their own record or they may have to do a lot of phone calls and back in with one another and youth Korea or service\nThat they would do that is a painting of her head and that scares me go ahead\nSo it is a real challenge for women and um which is incredibly important I think for women to understand especially as\nWe continue to be more and more on the low end as consumerism look on the rise and health care and we're starting to shop more for providers all trying to find the best bang for our but in a in a doctor\nIt's important that women understand that and they need to really take control of their best health experience\nAnd make sure that they get copies of their record with and allow them to get the best care wherever they're seen\nOne of the things that I've had in my experience my first and only wife died after Twenty one years of stage for breast cancer\nOr which as a has been pointed out of many people who have cancer or caught too late she had a mammogram and they didn't show any problem in about a month or two later she had a pain in her back\nAnd she would have that checked out and found that in the three or four months and she'd had the mammogram the cancer became visible\nAnd then went through all kinds of things the ... you know mess activities and lumpectomy ... and\nAnd the man she would she lost the lymph node spread it she lost an arm she had brain cancer I mean it was God awful as some of it was because the information they got from one person to another was wrong or just wasn't there\nSo let's talk about what members fear is and how it eliminates this kind of a problem Christian\nIt just wasn't there so let's talk about what members fear is and how to limit age this kind of a problem Christian\nAbsolutely so I'm I'm Glad you bring that up and thank you again for sharing that story you know he will find there's probably not a single family in this country that hasn't been touched by breast cancer in one way or another and I know you know I I have close family members and the name of Thirteen we all have close friends and even personal experiences where\nYou know you get in inconclusive results on a a man liquor and perhaps because you're going to a specialist or you're looking for a second opinion or maybe you just moved\nUm or we're looking for something different\nAnd uh you know a good friend of mine her doctor thought that he thought something but without those prior mammograms available\nHe wasn't a source that she actually spent days\nDriving all across town trying to get her images on at the the running all over the place\nBecause she didn't want to have to undergo another biopsy she had been hit breast cancer history and her path and um I just remember her calling us in tears and the office because as she got all these records over to a doctor physically handed it over and he'd gone home for the holidays\nSo she had to worry about whether or not you can't say for the holiday and you know this happened because when it comes\nWhen it comes to breast cancer screening every woman is unique the path mammograms are so important so mean fear and what part of a company based in Massachusetts our founders abreast help radiologists and we aim to empower when that went in and take control of those records\nBy giving them the power take digitally get at a store their own name a grand and to be able to send them to their doctor electronically without a hassle but we're we're

'cause we like it or not or going into the holiday season are which are probably because the economy's good will be good news for retail stores it'll be good news for people buying online now\nHowever there is some new research that has been released this week from the national Center for the middle market\nWhich provides a a retail industry for cash in Thomas stewardess here who is the executive director of National Center for the middle market I guess I Want to first find out from Utah Thomas what the National Center for the middle market is it's an intriguing name\n[noise] well do we we are a research organization Research Center at the Fisher College of business at the Ohio State university\nAh we exist to guide the companies that are mid sized ... uh the middle of the private sector which is companies tales between ten million a billion dollars a year big or small smaller than big at that actually are\nUh as I said it's about a third of the economy but it's the lion's share of economic growth the biggest growth is in these companies and we're the only guys out there are putting for serious resources in to studying who they are or how they're doing and what they can do to do even better\nSo let's answer those questions who are they and how are they doing I guess the why they may not be are you in described her as the with the dollar amounts but are they doing\nWhether that you know and what they are there at all sectors retail medical care a financial services I mean any industry you can\nAnd I was doing whether they're you know and what they are there and all sectors retail medical care a financial services any industry you can think of\nAnd they're doing really well I mean you know revenue growth in the in the last twelve months in the middle market has been more than eight percent and and job growth has been more than more than ... percent I'm we estimate that more than that about sixty percent of all new jobs come come from mid sized companies so they're doing really well\nUh they're looking forward to the holiday with with with with the holiday season with a lot of enthusiasm but you know tomorrow's Halloween\nAnd the flip side of all that holiday retail is this books and ghosts and goblins in there which is the whole cybersecurity question so uh you know they are also increasingly concerned\nUh about cybersecurity defending their customers their business their data or against a mounting mounting cyber threats\nAll right so what's new this year to protect people that wasn't around last year during the holiday season\nWell what's new is the concern I mean I mean the thing is that the the attacks constantly mutate it's like the flu virus at this that they're the bad guys out there are always coming up with new ways to try to try to get into your network new ways to try to get around some for five\nThousand let me ask the question a different way than if I made was destroyed the problems that big retailers and had I think you can name any of them Wal Mart target is to I mean to him right on the top of my head and they had real security breaches and there are a dozen more\nUh so if people go into these stores or even buy from them on line wants to secure which to make them feel better and maybe a from a business point of view what does the business owner this business group you're talking about do to prevent cyber insecurity\nWell the first thing is to get work and pay attention to it and and the good news on that is that we've seen a huge jump in the level of concern by retailers are and at all levels of side I mean the nice thing is the smaller retailers ... retail is a really woke up to this issue\nSecond piece of good news is that you see increasing reliance on cloud security which is to say hey I don't have the act I'm an expert retailer I'm not an expert cybersecurity\nHallelujah brother let me go to those ... let me go to Microsoft\nAnd Amazon or red hat or many of these others to get my security outsource it to these guys and that's ... that's how\nThey up to the task or are they able we've had problems most of the company than their own problems more so than Bob's garages\nYeah
