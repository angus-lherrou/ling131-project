J. B. program [noise]\n\nHave in common [noise]\nTakes up don't change your partner this is emotional management I'm Dr Christian cutting the more you try to change your partner the more disappointed you'll be\nPeople after all did not change each other and said we merely change ourselves so many couples fight because one partner wants the other partner to be different but again we don't change others we only have the capacity to influence them\nI I Know a lot of member we had the beginning of the school year we started talking about all the teachers who are buying things on their own\nNow there were ... happen right so we're going where's the money going ... that we were putting aside or what is it a hundred and eighty billion dollars that comes from the feds every year and who knows what untold billions are spent by the states and then property taxes\nAnd ... in Massachusetts were building for example a new school in our community school costs Ninety six or Ninety four million or something ridiculous like that\nAnd the the state pays for forty million of it state pays the state doesn't pay we pay taxes to the state and they yanked that money to subsidize with the locals are going to have to pay\nAnd attacks override\nBecause we don't have the facilities within our budget to pay for the new school\nSo what what was what's going on with all this money going to build a nice school got the money to do that we don't have enough money to buy paper books pencils though they don't use books any more they all have tablets assigned to them so that's another\n... eleven member town meeting couple of years ago we approve of eleven hundred dollars a piece for tablets for pretty much everybody in school\nIt's so ... who's using all these tools that are there why do we have such poor results\nIs a socioeconomic thing in this circumstance certain it looks like okay so I asked you ladies to give me your a take on this\n... well your question was why or Asian kids doing better than any other ethnicity I think that's a question for Asian kids and Asian parents did share your secrets I don't know I have no idea what the answer is I I Do a family structure that's debuting ...\nGet out ahead it's a ... yeah yeah ... there's a there's you know there is this different I think survival is a priority in in some ethnicities it you know especially in urban poor urban areas\nAnd um I don't think the divorce rate it and I don't think there's a higher rate of single parents\nIn Asian communities so that could be part of it there's a two parent system there at home um I don't know I think that there are probably a lot of factors and you can't change those factors you know those those are things that you just you\nCan't change but you're right though you have to at least look at the school structure and the education structure and the obviously there are a lot of holes that need to be plugged up\nSo you know you can't if that's if that's if the socioeconomic factor is a huge\nInfluence or on who's doing well well we can't really tackled that but you should absolutely get some answers from a superintendent as to why one school that is what a couple of miles away from the other one why\nIs there about a challenge different yeah yeah yeah I don't know how big your town is ... it's not a city you can't be to have a I mean I Know technically it is a city now I now but I'm not really that seven I'm I'm In New York is not a city at the town is now it's been and the populist the premium\nHas been pretty stable between sixty seven thousand in Seventy four thousand\nFor letting it I can remember oh okay\nTheir premium has been pretty stable between sixty seven thousand in Seventy four thousand for\nLetting it I can remember yeah oh okay yeah so yeah so so to me especially in a town that small there is no excuse why would there be such a huge difference\nNow so anyway it's interesting to see how these uh it's the it's the sort of same old story but I think that a lot of people are jealous of Asian families because they are pretty focused on getting ahead working hard and that includes a what goes on with students who are in school\nThat's work hard and achieve where we had the opportunity to achieve it seems to be an appreciation for the opportunities that are available here [noise] so anyway that's just something to kind of place on the thing about also to think about what's going on today national no beard\nDay men start your Shavers [laughter]\n[noise]\nGuy with the er\nYeah I worry that carries fathers\nOr

I'm doing on the job is that one of the problems with the boys are they can't do the job well because they're getting all everywhere to do this and this\nOver I think that people are relying on the police for everything you remember the story of the the little boy in um I Want to say it was outside Chicago he had the lawn mowing business and accidentally moved like swayed onto the neighbor's lawn and yeah they call the cops on and they called the cops on that\nI mean it's just it's the old cat in the tree like it's it's kind of coming it's true now you can people can call the police for everything oh yeah I didn't get my order Starbucks right call the police like it's crazy it's crazy\nIt's it is it's ... there's a there's a dad very serious racial undertones to it that's not that far under the surface and that's the that's really scary to me because I see I see so much racial tension bubbling to the surface and there are you know a lot of\nAlthough a lot of people feel that you know there's there's there are a lot of theories as to why that's happening now um but\nDo you think the best one is\nYou know I've had a very complicated conversations with my friends who are black or\nThat is one is [noise]\nYou know I've had a very kind of candid conversations with my friends who are black or who are Hispanic and you know they definitely feel like since Obama left office that there is a backlash against minorities and um you know and it's a it's a personal thing that\nThat my friends have expressed that they just think that there's there's tension white people are not all white people obviously but there are some white people in this country now who feel\nThat you know that Trump kind of speak their language and that they feel that they've been disenfranchised for eight years they feel like\nBecause we had a black man in the office for eight years that they're somehow white and people were left behind and there's resentment there there's there's so much to it and it's it's scary I mean when I think about it is scary but you know that's I think if you ask different groups of people around the country they probably all have a different answer\nYeah about ... news I guess what it is but it's very perplexing frankly neither person whose name is in the news Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards know who she is\nNatalie one heck of a name may flower sellers\nEdwards senior advisor at the Treasury Department\nLeaking confidential documents about a number of Russian probe targets including Paul Manafort officials that the FBI and the department of justice announced Wednesday they had arrested ms Edwards\nShe faces charges of illegally disclosing suspicious activity uh-huh illegally disclosing suspicious activity\nSo she linked to report is it mostly right Leah reporters editors some real news organization ...\nWell now so here's my question obviously what she did was illegal and she can do you in jail for ten years I think of how is this and I don't know the answer to this this is not like I Am genuinely don't know how is this different from what I'm Chelsea Manning did\nWas did Chelsea Manning go to a different type of prison because she was in the military is that\n... or early became Chelsea Manning yes right she read stuff to Snowden right right right so in this case that ... you know I was in Russia\nAre helping them to hack our um elections and whatever else or you can have a Mac\nAnd then um\nAnd what's her face didn't you get out of jail I don't remember the old ... however many years ... you know yeah so you're that you're including last year this woman go to jail I was like\nTo think she should go to jail I Do think she broke the law you break the break the law you go to jail but I'm just I'm just wondering what is the difference or is there no difference is it the same crime that Chelsea Manning was convicted of that this woman will now be convicted of or is it different because Chelsea Manning was in the military that's where I'm trying to figure out\nGovernment employees got him a secret different same ... sounds like the same kind of thing to me kind of sounds similar yeah\nOr does or doesn't pay what's the what's that expression\nI Wonder like what except on doesn't pay right except that she probably felt like she was doing some sort of ... out and I understand it the right than that um what else do you get from that ten years in the big house\nThe other day over in the room that I was looking at um some of the you'll enjoy this uh some of the sponsors\nThat have been on this program this is the thirtieth anniversary month of the what was the day program has matured into the DJ\nUh some of the sponsors that have been on this program this is the thirtieth anniversary month of the what was the day program has matured into the D.
