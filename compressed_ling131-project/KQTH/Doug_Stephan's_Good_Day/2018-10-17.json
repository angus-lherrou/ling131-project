one of those things where I think you know the headlines that oh disease comes I'm asking is now but it's something to be aware of something to think about something in your life as you keep yourself healthy think about your health\nI think about your immune system think about how you need to keep it strong by eating the right things and perhaps supplementing to ah keep that system that is in your body that protects you from getting ill it's weakest in young children and an older people and that's where all of this in this case young children who\nAre three four years old may not have their immune system enhanced\nOr they become targets for this stuff and then you start to think about\nSome of the other things you're talking about a Stephen Hawking is the last half hour some of the great minds that have been able to figure out ways to protect us as human beings from various horrible surges and then you think about disease and and what lives on the planet\nIt back to ... and is there a God he's beings these bacteria these viruses that some people theorize and I think August was one at one time in his career forty years or so ago I remember reading something that he said about humans killing themselves off\nIn the next few centuries and the bacteria and viruses taking over the planet\nThat's what we'll live on the planet for I Can't imagine well yeah I mean look at all of the things that have happened on this planet and the and the billions of years that it's existed what's lived here what's been able to survive here and then when it doesn't survive what comes along next it's really pretty fascinating [laughter]\nAnd you get right down to it but there's a lot of Scrabble ... around including this sort of thing so not to be scared but just keep your eye on it and make sure your immune system and the people in the family and people you love\nMake sure that they have um just the best possible food and the best way of keeping their immune system as strong as possible

any undertaking in which you would care to do over you'd like to do it I'd I'd like to do that again right we've all had those experiences\nWe can do that over again David McGuinn\nConfirmed his reputation or back in Nineteen eighty five fellow who was a journalist named John mackintosh interviewed Mr mom again for a column around the sport circuit was the column David confirmed stories about his additional shots that he took when he was playing golf\nWhen you go all the way back to the forties the Gulf association claims the term first achieved widespread use however McGuinn\nIn theory is concerned golf historians gave credit to John buddy Mulligan a locker room attendant at ethics felt country club in New Jersey for the word\nThat's wanting to at my dad's played that club that so fuzzy yeah ethics files a\nTheory number two going back to the Nineteen twenties David Bernard Mulligan a Canadian golfer one time manager of the Waldorf Astoria New York would often ask for a second shot off the T he says he coined or some say he coined the term Mulligan [noise] but if you all the way back to Seventeen Ninety three\nWho thought golf went back that far another version of the truth about the origin of the ... states that it comes from Thomas ... you know minor Anglo Irish aristocrat and very passionate golfer\nUh people like that are known to cheat I guess [laughter]\nAnyway so if you're a Mulligan person happy Mulligan day you know none\nOf his play golf I think all of this is my father and my dad is super into it as he and my mom is\nInto watching it on TV even though the o lay\nLo and what does she just wanted to take a nap it's a great idea now as regards into it they'll ... I don't get it as a golf channel for God's sakes I imagine they watch the golf channel I guess I I speaking of the channel the golf channel rehab television wise but see last night I'm just trying to think\nWhen it gets worse noting and I are you going to watch you can say you watched it and see I as\nI Know I did not and get back in time I wiped out the FBI I did not watch the Connors how was anybody watches\nDid watch it and you know it's interesting I thought that they did a really good job\nOf dealing with such an awkward thing and there are multiple moments during the episode where the family is grieving the loss of Roseanne and ... they they look like very real tears it it looked like it was a very emotional money was for the cast to shoot\n'em parts of it were still really funny I I for me I I was never a fan of the Roseanne show the first time around I don't know it's funny I never saw drew me neither but I like the few times that I did see the show I always loved encounter John Goodman character and I always like those aren't lean\nAnd and and I always liked the sister Jackie played by Laurie Metcalf and those three are really the stars of the counters and so I think that I'm definitely gonna keep watching I I\n... and it's I think\nPeople still tuned in I think it has a real chance yeah okay I ah the other thing worth production but good yeah I Know I didn't think I'd be saying that but the other thing that's worth noting Nathan ... new show the rookie is still trending on Twitter\n... the last few minutes of that I had forgotten there was on I was watching something else and watched it and it was a there are a lot of well known actors in you'll see a lot of familiar faces from other episodic TV shows yeah a guy who played the FBI Director who got killed in\nUm I'm which are the president's ah ah ah\nSouthern keepers who is it I'm a ... area I he was there and now he's the police sergeant anyway go ahead but it is I\nWell I think about the people on social media apparently loved it and he's in Philly and did a live tweeting along with the episode and so I think that that's been very much hype and I think that that is off to a really good start good um so it it it looks like it's a really fun show the\nThe premise for those of you don't know he's a forty something guy who becomes a rookie on the police force and the getting into his head why does he want to do it and is he a good crop or not\nA lot of familiar people's faces men and women who've been another a cop shows you recognize a lot of them anyway but yeah it's nice

should the government program to help you pay off guard it no\nI don't think there should be you buy what you buy in this case there's a bit of skilled agree uh and maybe that's what makes this unique some of these and I don't know ITT Tech been around for a long time they just found themselves kind of a done they were\nThey didn't belong there other ways of getting that technology that the technological knowledge now that are more efficient as so\nThey weren't broke a and so what sort of protection they have their should the notes just be written off\nThat might be a way of making it you know like mortgage interest as you write it off there are some things charitable there are some things in the tax code you can just ride off\nAnd there is bad debt that can be written off and perhaps that would have been a way to take care of instead of having people pay for something that really isn't there a right off the debt and that's the way\nYou might have buses or take it off yeah but the problem though is when in order to have a write off you have to have a certain amount of anger on any way I Do a a ... that that wouldn't work for most people who are in this situation\nHigh other money news it seems a lot a lot of landlords I saved a lot because it's not a lot is the lot pretty much all landlords\nAre happy that ... and Kmart are hitting the road if you will a there's a company called Kim co announcing that it was looking forward to getting new tenants into space is that now are occupied by Sears or k-mart stores a it's a big real estate investment trust\nLeases or three Sears locations eleven Kmart locations in the New York area average rent for the fourteenth Sears and k-mart stores five bucks a foot that's well below the average of Fifteen bucks a foot [laughter]\nThere are other property so they've at least is there for a long time it's because Sears as bad as because they've been around for a long time same thing through in LA in Miami the Hamptons those those places you can get Fifteen bucks at Fort easily so anyway\nUm it's a sad reality it's just sad to see the company run as badly as it was a and\nAs I said hey their rent and some of the stores right some of the some of the some of the landowners who are now being very vocal saying there you know happy to see the years go they weren't even able to collect rent\nFrom their attendance and there's really you know and that's a long process to get some one sided with the ... thing I Can't even imagine how long that will take\nYeah I Know there are I ... a couple of interesting items actually hear a protests the Park Service\nHas proposed a raising their um the cost of getting a natural but I thought they cut that earlier this year didn't we have that ... that my memory that the amount of money to pay to go into the ah parks was less than national park service didn't they cut\n'em but now they have new rules for demonstrators I guess in in in\nHow down in front of the White House I think that was our area that yeah that area is controlled by the national Park Service says and I think they want to charge more for permits right\nYeah yeah right right right out there\nOh I ... for an arrow testing though that yea for his visiting there aren't there play out there\nYeah um they propose that does the new rules for demonstrators who gather not only in front of the White House but around other monuments in Washington\nProtesters according to the proposal will repay the agency or for security perimeter processing helping to protect and preserve the cultural and historic integrity of the areas you know is it up in a down to this\nUh I think that there is a lot of damage being done by protesters\nOr who just you know are there to make a lot of noise and uh just wrecked stuff\nThe other thing though there are some good legitimate reasons and good legitimate protests are ... separate them\nIf you're a good legitimate protest group then um you pay them you pay the fee and who determines your very good but generally protest group well I don't think they're just talking about discriminating against any group I think that everything that everyone is going\nTo have yeah ... that's the point everybody ought not to pay because some of these groups are not there to make trouble are just there to tell people what they think they're a lot of people would go there do they want to make trouble\nRight well I think ... is obviously just somehow the park services wants to make more money so [laughter] I think this is probably their best excuse just gonna charge everybody more to protest\nBack again to the incompetence who government forty for happy hour in the D.

this pilot program it's called ... which means healthy and Spanish huh uh the whole purpose of the program is to work with kids between the ages of eight and Thirteen and both rural and urban communities here in Arizona\nHelp determine what some of the biggest stresses for them and then how do stresses impact their health primarily when it comes to obesity so they actually did uh the first part of this study up in Maricopa County in a rural community there\nAh they found some kids who were going to a community center over the summer they were out of school they uh what what those kids and they will go throughout six weeks once a week\nFor an hour they would teach them things like food portion control um they taught them how much sugar is and soda by visualizing it for them and then they give kids the tools to take home and practice\nSo they were measuring their blood pressure or their weight and they measured this weekly and they kind of started noticing that in some kids\nSome of those numbers were going down because they were being more mindful of the way they were treating their bodies\nAre they were also involving parents in this and they also were able to determine that one of the biggest toxic stress is for these kids in that community at least was the fact that they didn't know where their next meal was coming from or um whether or not they just had their last meal and that really impacted\nHow they were eating at home so that was a big thing that they found that they are going to be doing this in Tucson in the next coming weeks are going to be holding some
