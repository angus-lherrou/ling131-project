debt good my mother she babysit their kids or our kid right now will be two here in November ... um\nAnd she's planning on moving back so I mean right now we live with my mother in law which is my wife's mom and\nIf my mom leaves my wife has to quit her job to take care of the kids because the cost of a child care here is exponentially high um and we have an option to move down there with them\nI'm I'm thinking we should but because both of our jobs are transferable mhm we could transfer their Phil ... both of our jobs if she quits also we are helping insurance goes to my health insurance which is a lot more expensive than hers mhm and\nSo what does your wife make\nEr about thirty two thousand a year mhm\nAnd I make around forty okay\nYou know she's not going to ... for daycare on that you want to lose money she basically be working for daycare and health insurance but mainly um I mean it's not going to end just not twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be a you know Fifteen hundred isn't it\nYeah come up to Eighteen 'cause one will be born you know come out to be so ... yeah I'm All right uh and and what do you do for a living I'm In sales or my wife works for the state what do you sell a pest control and termites stuff like that\nMhm and that your company has a branch and the other city\nOh yeah and we're throughout the state okay All right\nUm well here's the thing that she waits which\nYeah here here's a meeting I think I Would want to decide where idle Leo's based on some formula other than where the babysitter lives\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're open phones a AAA eight to five uh five two to five Diane is on Facebook what his a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it\nWell a line of credit is an approved alone that you take out only when you would want to get pre approved and have a\nLien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\n[noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe try to take it the other way we want you to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one woman should get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit you to use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the call\nIs is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example for no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle or they're typically well bill I mean ... again Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a\nCadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck a Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nUh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing [noise]\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again the only kind of depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought a drove until I got about sixty or no got they got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so I was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um\nSo you know you just you're looking at that your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it it's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin\nHow are you hey they playing ... Sherman what's up\nI'm going to high school senior I'm got about three thousand dollars and I mean the count out donating should I invest in China and\nYou're going to college\nYeah I mean to college with an a plus for entertainment and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... served five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community college of either and you're at in our first yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever\nLike that okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it ah\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine\nCollege and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and is a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very ...\nMuch you dust and has a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not\nPut it in a retirement account to stage a with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal\nFor you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nAnd your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications and the ... tech field or or\nWhether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools and your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any of that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than but then the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can prepare for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our grows take home pay into our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that and I ... that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over promoted coloration so when we save the thicker than we're able to have a lot for a mortgage toleration though is it okay to do that or him recommend saving the twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you invested in that is that uh uh you're choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nAt the end and there's no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven uh okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nOkay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct guy I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a full nine what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we got us before then that means we need to put in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nYou know so uh that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers was put in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only accelerate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction\nOr something like that and I saw her at your mortgage a little bit I'm not gonna be perfect but you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction\nSo I'm I'm you know go do it that that's that's what I Would do about it off a little bit\n... thanks for the call appreciate your joining us this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life your seat changing these habits is the foundation of our teachings after smart conferences and I'm excited to announce this fall and\nWe did not do that\nYeah and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWith drew literally drew okay soil I also think that um they need to focus on why they're doing it so to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why might not be the exact same reason as his wife but at the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ... and go what was your y ...\nRight here I I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I listen to a lot of your stuff and a lot of other um had cats on legacy in relieving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to start teaching it\nMm mhm modeling it in teaching it yeah I Am change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves and and it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know what your if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders Illinois or some people that kind of went and I

your\nMoney is a recall a AAA eight to five five to two fine thank you for joining us we're glad you're actually starts off this hour in Baton Rouge Hi Ashley how are you\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay so my husband and I have all been told that are paid for and he came home last earlier this month I get one\nBut um we mortgage and this one well we're in a profit from mortgage that we have a construction on now and we are in a profit the turning into a regular market but I didn't have a bad feeling about it and I'm thinking about it\nAnd we and we can get another one without mortgage I just don't feel good about it\nOr ...\nBut he he wants to come in and have done that yeah you know I'm pretty manager\nHe said it's up to you yeah buddy bought it without talking to you\nOh no no he bought it we agree on mine like\nOh okay so you're agreed on the purchase and now you're thinking you don't want the bat\nRemember rent is twelve hundred and ...\nAgreed on the purchase and now you're on I think and you don't want the debt\nExactly the rent is twelve hundred and don't know if we can market to be four\nHundred and something\nMhm show how much will you owe on the property\nWe were oh Ninety to ...\nThen you have a four hundred dollar mortgage\nA four fifty seven yeah we did not grow taxes or you ...\nWhat did you do an adjustable rate thirty year\nWe did in ... well we wouldn't do it that we haven't did anything today mhm\nDo you have any money [laughter] [laughter]\nWell we have um\nNot really ...\nOkay I'm In I assume you can sell it and make money on it it sounds like right now All right\nYeah we can we cut my front cafe on that um\nAnd now we could probably make about ten to Fifteen Eli outright but you know when we knew that mad then we can make that and you know two or three years like collect in Iran but not really because we would have a mortgage on it oh ... oh that's going back and forth\nYou're with us John is on the line and it's our job welcome to the ... have thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise] well\nMy my wife and I have a pipe down a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you and\nWhat we've only got about two hundred and Fifteen out what to do because we have our mortgage oiled three rental property that we\nHave mortgages on and and those two and a half years we've had a fungal graduate high school he's in college we paying about how the tuition all he's taking out loans other half and I and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and see if I've got a beginner baby steps say but I just feel like I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm\nNot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand okay\nShow can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd stop the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on these federal property as we them for the past couple of years\nOkay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is our ... plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers\nThat are going to be going to college to here in the next few years ago yeah\nWell ... maybe steps for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and retirement five is kids college which you are cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really you just you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is stupid\nIn an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our consumer that we should just save up a a a three maybe four month emergency fund that Ben yep\nAnd then I then I stopped taking out student loans\nAnd clear 'em out and then to the same with the other day and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids it's there's money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two so it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nAre a house is tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nYeah it's about we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay a fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen yeah yeah and for one is the only ones\nOnly twenty five dollars and write them a check like\nThere are the fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for\nWhat is the only ones only twenty five thousand or write them a check like a year well no I was going to feel good and my son is still alive and take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I knew there was one in there somewhere to make the math work All right ah yeah still I'm just going to blink along on those minimums\nAnd take care of college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's a pretty even with the other one's\nAbout first ... back in the world okay or not\nSo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now well okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund\nRight yet I'm urgency find his baby step three and then by bishop Forrest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if it was money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list is mortgages\nDutch is that so there's still a prioritization even though ... says that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before skip a tree or two and three I guess technically you're\nGiven five or ... yeah yeah\nYeah and you have any skipped three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you know what you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nI'm In the it's an honor to talk to you how can I Do what then for you okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now we lifted it ends alive for two teams [noise] um I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter]\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um what we're struggling with piers we paid one fifty for the how\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that that occasion 'cause it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in a house in Harrisburg proper then\nNo no I'm In like northeast yesterday\nA up and you're up near New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes\nUh I mean three or six to nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says is you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to tell you other\nThan a is there anyone in that resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property\nIn the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is or a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our military that just not not hurting\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\n[noise] the higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work like I Can't do it anymore you know okay I mean kids you know we're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem or you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at they're looking at it on line there just workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was I walked away there were not client's\nLocation Gillum was not the house and it was not the brush\nOur neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his sold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer square miles to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do is go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and just gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it\nAnd that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is\nThe person that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel him down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area and they and they don't have a central Meyer stores you need to it's a very unique semi rural ...\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans find\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and simply\nWasn't that way on one of those ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to Dave Rand date handler onboard beginning so I mean I'm\n... with your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the\n... which really only not wired it was really difficult to to give out some things that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of oil down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show them and say we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart because you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that yeah well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with a leg that kinda stuff with the income you've got and no debt even do anything you wanted to them and you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so it was right\nScott and no debt even do anything you wanted to them and you can go to like in Europe as you want I mean as you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses ourselves right man it's um you know you are your free up to still have incredible\nUm family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say interesting\nVery interesting\nSo um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um [noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off who were able to pay off the home that we live and mhm\nAnd so we we use the cash derived from that\nPlus cash flow and some savings to pay for our home that we live and okay so it was just three property ... yeah that's what I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt which everyone operates okay we're the home Eleven's worth what one point six wow you guys are amazing\nCongratulations oil and obviously holding back then and clearing that that's a big part of the equation too yeah cause that's secured then amazing\nAbsolutely amazing so you're sitting there with a net worth Whelan access or two million dollars now easily I'm the I'm guessing it for one case but with his income you've got to be loading up so um\nHow Sheffield feels great I mean I'm\nYou know I'm I'm I'm kinda to the point of a second guessing even even having so much of our network tied up in a house ... um so but it feels great you know it's it's a it's a first step in a journey yeah yeah\nWell I get give yourself a couple three years to think on that one you don't have anywhere to go you're in great shape don't worry about

that were given mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if you click true\nThat is true definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for\nGays oh okay so what's your household income [noise]\nUm [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand this year\nOkay let's say let's say you're a ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal what's your yeah your I have about\nTwo hundred dollars per thousand so that is forgiven that hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so yeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have and in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in that case so you're

share with each individual what will affect them\nUm\nWould be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but had a lot of wealth in the background\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about but then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot who we hit the lottery 'cause I was for me and my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of it\nSo they need to be emotionally mature and ...

too well that's the subject of our show today Welcome to it's your money I'm Jeff Logan president a premier retirement planning of wealth management and today we're going to pull back the curtain on the lessons of how the rich get richer and how you can too\nI'm Jeff Logan president a premier retirement planning a wealth management and today we're going to pull back the curtain on the lessons of how the rich get richer and how you can to my oldest is with me Linda ... good morning\nNodding and happy weekend\nMan it's always a happy weekend so we have good weeks to though it's you know every day is a happy day when ... when people retire and stay retired yeah I think I Love my job so [noise] you know a lot of people think millionaires get there and you know it's kinda funny we talk about millionaires back when I was a kid a millionaire it was some is so rich\nNow I don't think I was fired him in him it's kinda like that's kind of a number a lotta people shoot for for just kind of a basic retirement nevertheless there's a lot of people that\nDon't get to that million and wonder oh my gosh how am I going to make it how am I going to keep that income coming in my retirement so that uh I don't run out of money and um you know how did these people get million or millions of dollars in their four O. one K. so their retirement plans or how did they say how did their how does their money keep working for them\nAnd they don't seem to be as worried as I Am maybe as my retirement that's how some people you know um sometimes thanks\nSo just because you don't have a million dollars doesn't mean you can't live your idea of retirement\nNo it certainly doesn't that's we're going to talk a lot of that has to do with just\nCreating habits and doing the things that those people that\nI'm a little bit more money have a little bit more practice at it and they they have made some smart decisions along the way going one of the things that I always say is you know our our our job is to help people live their ideal retirement life and if you are ... the chief that\nIt's because you've made some smart decisions along the way and and our job is advisors to help people make those smart decisions along the way and\nFor some people they kind of learn those smart decisions and they learn the smart money habits earlier in life than others unfortunately but it's never too late to start and so\nWe're going to uncover the seven biggest things that make a difference between what we see the successful people that come into our office and talk about planning by the way we have a lot of people that are you know would be considered the millionaires the multi millionaires rich people that come up that still wants to tweak their plan and I think that's really leads into the number one answer is\nYou know you think the rich people they must be pretty smart they must be able to do it on their own but you know number one is they get advice\nThey value the advice of a professional\nThey do and you know most of them are professionals not most of them but many of them are professionals and have had careers where they are very specialized in their own area\nWell when I my very first career my primary care is that called a management consultant I was focused on understanding may um industry getting updated on that most current ads managerial process for improvement I wasn't focused on finances I hired somebody to do that for me\nRight and and I think most people if you're if you've got a high paying job or you're really trying to save for retirement and be focused\nSo that you can make enough money to retire comfortably ... you're going to really have to be kind of a you know in a niche market be focused in a in an area where you're worth more and and typically those people\nThat have been able to save have had and have had good incomes are focused and we have to think of a doctor I mean there are great at Madison but\nYou know many of them have no clue about the financial aspects I mean I'm pretty good a finance I think I'm really good actually I mean if you don't mind me share my bias but I think you are [laughter] but you know I Lived I go to the doctor today because I have no idea what's wrong with my eyes so\nThat it was ... when you need\nExactly and you know money is no different there are a I wouldn't call them tricks but there are um strategies there are techniques there are products that work different ways and you know knowledge is power and you can only get that knowledge by seeking it and sometimes just take it from a professional\nThat already has that power you know when you were the quality business you said before I mean you didn't just pick up all kinds of books and try to\nTaking it and sometimes just take it from a professional\nThat already has that power you know when you're in the quality business you said before I mean you didn't just pick up all kinds of books and try to read and educate yourself because you had a job a fulltime job you know um if you if you have a job and you're doing something else you can't be a master of all ... you can't be a Jack of all trades or you will be a matter of non\n... and that's why we focus on comprehensive financial planning for those people that are getting ready to retire or are already retired and that's that's really the niche focus\nFor and that's the primary cracks that that they seek out professional advice but they have that plan that financial plan that retirement plan on and we've talked so many times about the importance of having that plan\nWell in you know it's it's it's no secret that the earlier you start with a plan the smarter decision that is so many people wait until the last minute and then decided to put out or they just think the plan is going to happen by itself because they accumulate\nA certain number of dollars out of hand and hand it it is but a lot of people say well I don't know I don't know who's managing my four oh one K. all I Know that I have to put in a regularly and somehow when I retire I'll have a magic number in there that will have to you know create some lifetime income from and [noise]\nUm because they haven't secured those sources of income and they're living that just in case lifestyle what if something happened we can't spend money we can't go on that trip because something might happen and then where would we be so can you imagine\nThe sense of calmness security knowing that you will had those paychecks coming in to replace your employment paycheck of adult insurance\nYou know and I think the a very common way to do it if some people say well I'm just going to buy more dividend stocks because I can I can rely on the dividends or I'm going to buy more bonds\nAnd you know there there is a strategy is very simple and very basic strategy that I think people employing that as\nWell as long as I have enough short term bonds to get me through a five year correction all be fine well in the meantime you're not making any money on those bonds you're spending all that principle down just waiting for your old assets in the stock market to get back to even\nAnd I say five years because that's how long the last two big corrections took one and two thousand that ended in two thousand and two and the one in two thousand and eight that started reading just before two thousand and eight ended in early two thousand and nine\nThose on the blue chip stocks crashed fifty percent both times and both times it took five years for the market to get back to that even starting point and progress on so if you're spending down even if you're spending down\nBond or cash money that doesn't lose value you're not actually making money during that time you're actually spending down assets and so that argument doesn't really hold water you need some actual income that you can use that generates in combat pay those bills every month so David in stocks may also go down by the way Yeah David in stocks may continue to pay that two or three percent dividend\nBut if you need to use more than just that the evidence and\nAnd actually sell some stock because of a rainy day expanse or to actually a liquid some assets you're going to liquidate at a loss and so they would have stocks may not be the answer bonds or may not be the answer if you're just spinning them to live on while the market recovers\nUm we like there's wires well we do like to learn but I was thinking you were going to jump ahead Ethan queen sitting right next to me so I thought sure she was like a we love annuities [noise] you know we don't level annuities we love the annuities that are fixed meaning safe\nThat create excellent income generally speaking they're going to be fixed indexed annuities that go up when the market goes up they don't go down when the market goes down and those companies are able to create a much better guaranteed lifetime income stream\nThat companies use variable products because they're not taking risk with your money if you're going to guarantee income don't you want to guarantee product yes ah it's kind of like I Want to make sure\nThat I I Can't ever run out of money\nThey guarantee never to run out of money even if the account drops to zero and you mentioned alert this what lurks also the life insurance retirement plan also have\nUm a very similar gift and that is guaranteed lifetime income not all life insurance policies run out when your cash value runs out\nThat's been taken care of with the evolution of new\nYou know new generation life insurance products or these companies you know life insurance companies want to be competitive and stay in business to they want to create products better products and do better things that can help people in retirement because they do own a piece about retirement market they also want to make sure that you don't run out of money and even life insurance just by the way we don't buy 'em for that\nBecause they do own a piece of that retirement market they also want to make sure that you don't run out of money and even life insurance just by the way we don't buy 'em for death insurance unless you need to replace income for a spouse or a survivor\nBut we do love to place them in a portfolio in order to generate income on a tax benefit basis lurks give you a tax free income tax free death benefits an extra long term care bumped should you get sick are in need that money before you die and it's all tax free if you set it up right\nWhich actually kind of leads us into number three is that um it's all about taxes and having a tax data gene moving forward\nIf you save thirty thousand dollars a year in taxes\nThat's thirty thousand dollars a year actually you can spend we just did a plant where they're going to save about thirty thousand dollars a year in tax it we just wanted at this last week\nAnd it's amazing that just using the current tax code taken advantage of lower taxes now you can shift money out of IRAs either do rocking versions are confirmed alerts to take advantage of true leverage and tax leverage on your money to create a lot of extra tax benefits um [noise]\nYou know one thing ... uh or about taxes when we come back I think we're a run out time we segment but\nYou know one last thing um I Would say that it is a good thing to do as far as income is not a bad thing to have real estate investments that generate income\nUm a lot of our clients have some people have generated some rental income that really has come in handy to have that consistent and could not keep in mind nothing's guaranteed you never know if that runner's going to move out in the middle of night but um that's why we need diversified sources of income we've talked about several room about talk about taxes when we come back we're\nGoing to see if your plan is the first fight and you've got to retire you're ready to retire stay retired give us a call five too old to on seven eighty five sixty six that's for retirement readiness review to see if you're ready to retire and stay retired life you will see one Seventy five six ...\n... to ... strategies used by the ultra rich managed care [laughter] don't go away [noise]\n\nMm\nWhether you're already retired or planning she retired ... window whether you're from your return of their wealth management will help you maximize your income minimize your taxes ... protect what you have more than a lifetime to achieve now back to hits your money [noise]\nJak at that time again for your financial ... of the week\nYes it is and this week we're talking about your retirement income planning checklist not that we haven't ever talked about income planning yet we talk about it all the time in fact\nIncome in retirement is probably the most important topic at least it seems to be the most important topic to people that we meet with on a day in and day out basis so as an offer also for this tip just listening you can get if you want to give our officer call\nThe actual book it's a pretty thick or it's more than a brochure a booklet that is your retirement and complain checklist complementary of premier retirement planning a wealth management gives you ten\nItems that you need to consider as you consider your plant now first one is planned for a long life\nYou know it's it's amazing how much longer people are living it's amazing how often I find out people who come in and some of our clients are having their parents moved back in with them and there are a hundred or more or at least in the late nineties\nYou know I read a statistic that if you reach age sixty five up a couple of reaches a sixty five healthy there's a chance of forty percent chance that one of that couple is going to exceed age Ninety so planning on a long life may be an important thing the other thing is because of it\nChance that one of that couple is going to exceed eight Ninety so planning on a long life may be an important thing the other thing is because of that long life you might find out that you're paying a lot more health care expenses than you thought and that is number two health care expenses not only will probably be a part of your life\nLonger but it will also consider the inflation and the fact that it's ... I I Know it's just the fastest growing as far as inflation goes is the is placing affects health care more than anything\nHow about a housing plan or two\nThat is number three you have a housing plan or you're going to downsize do you have a child with a big house that expects you to move into a mother in law quarter do you have a housing plan as in assisted living should you be unable to get around or do things what if one of the spouse dies early what's the housing plan in that case so\nHave a few contingencies for your housing plan what about long term care or assistance you know about half of the people\nUnfortunately don't just die in their sleep or die easy it's usually we get a little people we get a little bit to\nA disabled and we just can't do the things that we used to do so
