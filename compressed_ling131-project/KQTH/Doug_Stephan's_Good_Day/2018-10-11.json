yeah it's I I don't even want to say this but we're just popped into my mind some of my best friends are gay or it's like people stupid people saying\nOh our best friends are black or is our best friends or Jewish or how our best friends are above Lincoln's you know that\nKind of stuff which is in the main stupid because you judge people not on this kind of crap but on how they treat you and how you eat or act and how they either seem to get along or how they\nAre in relationships you don't want to have them as a friend because you don't like the way they may be treat your ... it was something of significance that you don't want him as a friend 'cause they're Republicans or they're gay or they're black or whatever it is\nBut yet there's so much of that Victoria now\nIt's that's a I have all the things in my life that troubled me\nThat's one of the most troubling aspects of being an adult in America today it it bothers me it is and you can hear me I sometimes just shutting having these conversations because they seem to go no place\nAnd maybe that's a circle I'm In I don't know I think things are getting better I just hope that children today are going to grow up and not feel the same as many children are grown up in my era there are many people who are my age that are just ridiculously prejudice for no good reason um yeah it just\nI remember at home you know that of course is that how severe environment absolutely and you know the people who are and I\nSay this lovingly for both sides are the people who are they that if you want to use politics that people who describe themselves as conservatives and the people that they should run\nFor whatever the reason that people who are liberal and the people that are shunned by liberals for reasons and may not even be politics people who are black who don't want to hang around with white people people who are white don't want to hang around with black people people who are Jewish don't want to hang around with\nChristians you know it's that same it's this it really boils down to the same stuff\nAnd then when you get to the root of all evil when it comes to those sorts of considerations I think about Jerusalem thank heavens I've been exposed to it been there five times in my life the fact that all of the major religions of the world with one exception\nStarted in the same place\nAnd those same religions people who are practicing them\nWork and live together in that city like there was no difference whatsoever they're all semi they all look the same they all when you're going to do business in the walled city of Jerusalem or fail treat you the same\nAnd yet outside the walls it's like this whole different world it is a different world brought about by people who are trying to control and make powerful decisions or whatever it is\nAnd I'm no good comes of it is but it that way no good comes from prejudice none zero there's not anything good that comes from the fear of somebody else just because they are and you fill in the blank whatever it is\nGood that comes from the fear of somebody else just because they are and you fill in the blank whatever it is\nI don't want to be around that guy um you're on a woman or a less of a problem for men to be around lesbian women than probably any other category at least from my experience um it's like ...\n... men love each other\nWell that's what I'm saying [laughter] Jackie what I'm saying in a different way but with others uh it's kind of like the clouds in the circus or look at that guy [laughter]\nIt's ah it's ridiculous one wonders\nIf you believe in God or ... or Supreme Intelligence or whatever the term you use in for them to try like spirit of you believe in that sort of thing how is that you carry with you the prejudices that some of you or many of you do like that something look in the mirror\nI always I find those who were prejudice need to be looking\nIn the mirror why are you holding on to that what good does it do to be that way thinking about\nSome people are just very comfortable in you know in what they have always known and stepping outside of that into the unknown is is just too terrifying for some people\nNo question about it but think about why you are that way I guess\nAs a yeah ... let's get to these sports desk\nFight or we didn't do television right and\nAs they did not but we write television there's a ton of stuff on tonight\nYeah I see that the uh show New Amsterdam\nOr the medical drama with Ryan egg old who was a on the blacklist the last three or four years uh that got renewed full season order by NBC the first official full season pickup of the broadcast season how many other shows are in\nThat a league one wonders um it had an eight point four million viewers which is the first episode which is pretty good for a new show when you consider all of the things that are out there uh when I'm\nWhen does the rookie come out with ... trillion that's supposed to be\nThat is a little later that the opposite New Amsterdam next week that will be really interesting to see the two of them go head to head yeah because there's so many there's so much hype behind Nathan ... new show the rocky and he didn't look good a genuinely yeah if you look at Yale I'm excited for it he's\nMore well known than Ryan ... do you see him in ... and but he's not somebody you turn on the TV like I Want to when he was on the blacklist I Want to see ... in the ... that ... that comes back on later in the season I Want to see that and I want to see\nA s a path and murders and in Chicago mid I Want to that's one of the reasons I Will tune in for at least for the first time to see what's going because you are recognized the name but ah yeah I think it'd be interesting to see them as they go head to head by what else you said there's a ton of stuff\nYou have lots of network stuffed up tonight it on ABC eight PM brand new Grey's Anatomy on MTV it eight PM brand new episode of Jersey Shore family vacation\nOn the cw there's new supernatural on and on NBC at eight there's new super store brand new big bang theory eight PM CBS\nAnd of course if you're into football the Philadelphia Eagles will play at the New York giants that's on Fox at eight o'clock tonight if you're into the good place which is a really great sitcom very unusual or with Christian Valentine dance and that's a brand new episodes night on NBC at eight thirty\nFollowed by eight thirty on CBS is young Sheldon if you're into that show and ah then there's a brand new will and grace at nine pm on NBC\nCBS is young Sheldon if you're into that show and ah then there's a brand new will and grace at nine pm on NBC and that features guest star Alec Baldwin as caring love of ... and ah and then there's also a brand new episode of mom and a nine o'clock at CBS as well\nSo you know disappointed me about a Christian Bale and I don't know where I saw this or heard this may maybe we were talking about it on the air that she's a big pot smoker I remember that bothered me also when I heard it about um\nUh Jennifer Aniston and some other people that you are a hold and regard I don't even know why because you don't think that way about people who drink is\nI think when I think that's been really over eggs at ... he's a mom with little kids I think that there was sort of a joke there about her being a big stone her and her husband is sober and I think that that's been really blown outta proportion um but yeah I don't I don't think there's a whole lot to do that\nBut if it's you know I don't know it's to me that doesn't I don't that doesn't faze me\nSee I understand I'm just saying and kind of a ... a speculative way that's oh let's get to the sports says 'cause there was a heading that direction a few minutes ago anyway\nA for a lot of time this season or the or the watching a football games last year he was a they're in big trouble because of the viewing is way off falling TV ratings ... ran other things going on protests of concussions and things\nBut now ah the NFL yes has its issues but apparently major league baseball's best season hasn't done well at all attendance dropping off at the games TV ratings are nowhere near where they used to be most of the games are too long stemmed too late into the night\nOr children are not growing up to the baseball fans and is that something that is rooted in the game or the management of the ownership a game\nThree of the ... thing I really do I think well the games are so long and I you know my husband is a sports producer and he hasn't he doesn't sit through an entire game I don't know anyone who does and attendance I get it if you no one wants to spend a lot of money on tickets and then leave after four or five innings\nBut the games can go on for three hours or more so\nAnd who what kid is really good I I don't I think that there's a really valid point about the next generation of baseball fan I don't know that there will be a next generation unless you're in a really baseball ... family and you grow up just loving baseball I don't I don't I just don't think that kids are that into it\nHuh that's very interesting you say that I find that I don't know I just it seems like just as ingrained me I've never been a big sports fan anyway it was good baseball player when I was a kid or better than me and I was a fan of going to the games I just like in the ball out of the park and running the first base in the run out of breath [laughter]\nHave for for having to do it yeah but the thing is like
