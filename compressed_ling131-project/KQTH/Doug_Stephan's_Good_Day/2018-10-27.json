I'm sure because it's relatively new gathered I yeah but what I Would do is just try to estimate\nUm so if there was a ... year but I Do is because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand dollar to duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nA whatever a line in your budget\nFor medical expands ongoing chronic medical and just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really I think you're right now on\nWhat I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we ... we got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem\nWhere I got into that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition and actually switched jobs had more functionality\nOn some in a fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and I make

they can hear it I was trying to ... stick thing mhm on medical and then the student loan to that is going to cut it out and it had like a total of six speak out\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food pantry not eating you know not eating out friday and you're paying your life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food shoulder clothing and transportation utilities\nThe eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson and what's the necessity necessity is only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities in the New York is about end of the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nThe end of the debt as you can and here's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\n[laughter] you're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... said I've got ... how do I prepare for it you're saving coverage so\nNow that's our short term long term we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to\nDo with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face and so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but ah we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards it's time for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi\nTucker how are you [laughter] I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step the right now I'm In fact we just paid off our second credit card today though we are done like credit card and moved on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working the base that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nOh no we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... law and get your input on it\nWe have our ten percent of it but we want to tie without thinking about putting data and giving back to the church and didn't have an extra five percent and kind of giving it to\n'em or their charitable organizations that we believe in that are about it one day or a ... you know when the crisis mission is that we're trying to looking at trying to give what we can to people who need it\nUm but and she's on the other hand want straight ten percent a church and then you are or what we thought what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give it to church and\nWe had a big argument about either yesterday so it was\nI was on you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament is tent it literally means chant the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to ... they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker a plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love ya [noise] and\nUm you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a time\nA love you but the best way to live your life is to to give and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed within the New Testament is a ties a tenth of your income evangelicals are taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years\nThat that five is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer your wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical lots of your wife was argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that rather [laughter]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nBeen listening to for about a year I'm On and off and I'm right now we're in we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand in cars twenty two thousand and other debt like credit cards and all that\nSo one Osama includes cars\nYes it is because the cars fifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's the ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income\n[noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty\n... a year where did you use to the old drum yeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate ... I've got to choose the house has sold takes listings and expanding clothing by the end of uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand\nBy the end of the year and now what does your why didn't make of the one who makes\nFifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long the span 'em and her thing if she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter]\n[noise] okay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a princess and be selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need it my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these calls means of course we'll have\nIf I can get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to as\nI'll get a car cash and then she sells her car and then what have at least one car right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay offs and other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming\nIncome they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there ending or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do stay close\nTo three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today\nI Would show your trial today and I but\nI Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth about making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and pay off thirty seven dollars an hour for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you're not wanting to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble than\nShe is not willing to\nJoin armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem\n[noise] okay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit you run around started selling mama's car is not way good way to get mom on board\nHalo so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nBut if that and then you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looked at us on our car drew and you get are cheap car to drive you drive a cheap

and how I should attack upcoming student loan debt I'm thirty one years old right now um [noise] what do you want to know\nYou already know what his upcoming student loan debt\nAlright so four years ago to get a promotion at work I decided to go back to school and it didn't pay off I landed the promotional two years ago and now the loans are kicking and then if I got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying 'em off sooner but\nI I Am get free or two years ago we had our first child and we use\nNo you're not you're a student loan debt he well yeah okay so I'm I'm not that free now my student loans that they are\nEager and coming up Seventeen months I got to start paying for it\nOr not it's not coming up it's there it's just whether you've got to pay it when you have to pay it so what's your household income\nUh\nIt went from only twenty five when we were both working to Seventy five now my for income\nAnd how much of a promotion did you get an ...\nOnly twenty five when we were both working to Seventy five now my full income\nAnd how much of a promotion did you get in return for going into debt fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lotta overtime in the path so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent increase you might be ...\nIt didn't show on the paper called your check not yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true and I've I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now four hundred thousand between my four oh one big assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I I'm not terrible but I just want to know\nWhat kind of way gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nI have a hundred thousand and vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollar home\n\n[laughter] [noise] thanks for\nOnly a few five five five Andy and Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped by\nBecause we're in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but thanks for coming by guys are you going to have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... own own will be rented or on\nWe currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry ... journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a you know\nYou need to get with insurance broker and what kind of our insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the time that they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and show\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property or they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would\nCarry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords couch you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker\nCan walk you through how to do that and I'm I'm not an expert on camping\nAnd so treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs to this much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and they cause this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing him on his liability do do hold harmless agreements a carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\n... and\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins okay and um that's\nA liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hall Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk\nI but I hold harmless is it what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful [laughter] ...\nTwo page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still wobble\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a thanks for the call and use Russia you're joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you're jumping we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll

and I'm a new American I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby step and I know that number one of the thousand dollar\nAmerican the fine my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in a stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you OK but um that's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and never happened to act we really lucky we've never been laid off you go in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she don't couple of weeks to do something ... going to\nFind something to do when he comes home and they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws on one of the makeup of every step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program\nAnd I do that first in a rough IRA and then I Do it in a Roth T. S. P. after that\nIf they're matching and don't think they do but if they're matching on the ... going to start their with Iraq with the match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate it got to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey what does that\nWell I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and pay off any other dead also that I have\nOh I'm not sure that that if you got\nTo cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the life that would say three or four months\nYou've got your your debt free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on balls each or total on both total okay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty\nOkay you gotta lotta car and um so what do you own your primary and what are you on the rental\nMy primary goal to fix the and it's worth about five fifty mhm and the rental and um my rental Ohio one fix the end is worth about I Would say or thirty fellow that's worth it but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right and so on you know if we stay taken say\nYou come to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we take take and say I'm you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing more forty fifty grand a year at that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um or you can show the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had him classroom whether to to do that and and pay off most of the party much ... pretty much all my dad on it\nBut I also have in mind for that but I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nI don't know how to house payment you can catch while they're right okay\nYou know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check that out there and they tell me Gary by a car you pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do that because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work you can't shorter ride him you've got a ride him or not and so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense\nAnd I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college and I would say about me some other rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from the day you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got a break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental on pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want to just do it in a savings account to junior college junior colleges do it in their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby step share the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ...

you're going to end up being not where you want to end up being so I'm willing to go out on that proverbial limb and say let the show be different let it be\nIn its own environment versus all the other financial talk shows that are on the radio and that's not the pat ourselves on the back but it is to say this\nWe want to tell you what's going on to get you to pick up the phone and call us and have you come in and that's where we put the plan together that's where we address what we call the ... of life so it's not a popular message and we're going to talk more about it here and just a little bit but\nYes you you if you're a\nAvid listen to mark what about the salute to I didn't forget that so here we go to America [noise] Adam\n... way back we talked about first responders and I kinda wanted to throw that out again today because of an incident that happened recently with a a dear friend of ours his wife got in a very serious car accident\nAnd he was relating this story that are the people that showed up the police the ambulance\nAnd then the the the surgeon at the hospital all these people it was like a a symphony of making sure that this gal was going to be okay and so at listening to his story it made me realize that you know at the end of the day when things happen\nWe want those first responders to be at the top of their game right trust and we want them to have had a good night's sleep\nOut of the annuities out of the life insurance and you're right the markets backup\nYet have you hurt your annuities or have you hurt your life insurance now\nAnd we explain all that to you ... come to a greater understanding and appreciation just adds to the leverage that these vehicles can provide so that's something that you really I encourage you to consider it to me it's all about positioning\nAnd\nPart of this means that you have to have the guts the\nThe the the inter intestinal fortitude to go look I Want to address this now is it a popular topic you probably at this point of view I gather the kids around the room you're telling and go play go outside more what Mark's talking about is not for your ears it's PG Thirteen it's like oh my goodness the stuff he is saying is going to happen looked\nA Math Doesn't lie it just doesn't and so this movie if you'd like to see the trailer the two and a half minute trailer to the power of zero\nYou can email me I had a gentleman I emailed it to me [laughter] he emails evacuee goes this is scary stuff you know it's almost so scary people dismiss it they got there's absolutely no way this was going to happen so\nHere's the question what if I'm wrong what is this stuff never happens heavily hurts you by how we position how we re deploy how we put you in in areas where we are protecting what you have amassed what you have created what you have grown the answer is no ... hurts you know\nBut let's say I'm right you will come out on top\nWill have done the very best the most prudent thing you can do at this juncture by position yourself for what I Believe is inevitable this is not politically expedient aren't you just tired I Know I Am and I noticed Asian plays the ads and all\nFor what I Believe is inevitable this is not politically expedient aren't you just tired I Know I Am and I noticed Asian plays the ads and all I'm just tired I'm sick and tired I'll use I'm sick and tired frustrated\nOver all the political ads that are running and the name calling and listen to that and that and this and you know what\nIt's just I'm I'm done with it I mean can we saw\nThose people all of them my opinion they don't really care and this is my opinion mark any can write me hate me hate mail whatever\nThey're in this for them they're in this\nFor them it's not politically expedient for them to say you know what we have to raise taxes you have to cut benefits we have to switch the full retirement age for Social Security nobody wants to say that because then they're not going to get reelected\nBut what I'm saying to you right now is so important that if you don't\nHave this you're not going to put the position to take advantage of when the bad news comes so here's\nA couple of questions I Want to ask you and oh by the way that two and a half minute trailer just email me mark at more F. S.\nDot com market more F.

people in the markets I can charge fees I can do all that produce Sherry and all that but the message today is is what I'm saying is true then you really need\nA safe haven you need to migrate towards

that it's all about for the most part\nRates of return I don't want to play that game because it is a game don't want to do that won't go there won't do that so give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four I have to mention this thing as well\nAnd I think it's important and it it dovetails very much so into what we're talking about when it comes to long term care and I I'm hoping my prayer my uh\nMy hope is that we can get Mr Harley Gordon to come to town he's a uh it probably one of the foremost a elder care attorneys in the country and he's written a book and so I said a little bit ago before the break we're going to talk about his book\nIt's called the convert station called the conversation and this is what are you know trust and said is this the conversation people don't want to have this how how apropos to Harley's book\nAnd the subtitle is helping someone you love plan for an extended care event\nIt's easy for me and I'm I'm not going to do this but it would be easy for me to take out all the statistics that are out there about how many people are going to need long term care how many people every sixty four seconds are diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia\nYou know what that does not connect with people we think as agents that it does it it will put people in a position of they start to worry they get anxious this anxiety decree they say wow I Need to pick up the phone I Do you call those guys one person every sixty eight seconds is being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia wanted to ask me\nWell folks that doesn't encourage people to do the planning it just scares them\nIs being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia wanted to ask me\nWell folks that doesn't encourage people to do the planning it just scares them into maybe not doing anything so Harley's book really brings front and center the idea that it's not about now I'm Talking to the guy here\nWomen get this it's us guys we have a hard time with\nA guy guys men gentleman it's not about the risk of you ending up in a facility or having to have care\nThat's not what's at stake here that's not the issue that's not what you're jeopardizing what you are jeopardizing and this is the real message\nIs the consequence of you not having a plan the consequences of what's going to happen to you I'm Sorry to your family your kids your grandkids your spouse should something happen to you this is Carol is\nIn fact if you don't have a plan it is likely that will it will tear your family apart\nIt will tear your family apart\nNot having a plan and not properly funding it can disrupt all efforts to secure a sense of financial viability as you and your family move into the future that's what not having a plan will do\nYou know what we have a deep as a gay guys again women you can don't have listeners but us guys we by nature heavy deep seated aversion to thinking about anything truly awful occurring do you like nobody nobody gets up in the day\nHey what if I get in a car accident today what if I have a stroke whatever Mart nobody likes to think about that stuff\nNor do they like to think what if I have a need for care what if I'm going to have to have somebody paid me feed me clothe me take me to the doctor's appointments\nAnd so as a result because nobody thinks about it the subject is dismissed and that's what ... contention is\nThat being more the case certainly when you're talking about hey you need to own a long term care insurance policy so what Harley's hope when he put together this book was to change your mind by altering how the subject is talked about\nWhat I Hope to do what my goal is when I have this conversation yeah the conversation and nobody wants to have is to say this\nIs that when I'm done I Want you and your mind to say mark Jeff really the conversation the consequences are too severe\nThat I Need to take action I Need to do something because I don't want to put I don't want to have my kids my grandkids my spouse left to deal with this\nSee one way or the other you're going to be kept safe if you have an incident you have an extended care event they are going to find a way to take care of you we know that we're here in America right somebody will rise up something will happen whether you have money you don't have you will be taken care of\nThat's not the problem the problem is what is going to happen\nTo your family it's about your commitment to protect your family regardless of what happens to you the book talks about as he says you're the serious and often irreversible consequences providing care\nCan have on those you invited into your life I think about that\nSo we'll consequences providing care can have on those you invited into your life I think about that the consequences to those you love you said yes to the altar\nYou now have embraced over the years you saw them through elementary school and middle school and high school and college and now they have careers and now are they going to have to put their life on hold see we have that conversation that's a conversation a lot of people don't want to have it hits you square between the eyes just like oh my goodness\nWell Mark I don't think that's ever going to happen well okay let's have a plan so just in case it does happen look you're going to be fine\nBut it's the consequences to those you love and you care about those are going to be the ones that you might be doing irreversible damage to should you not have a plan in place\nThat's what Harley's book is about\nA I Believe it's in reprint right now they're they're printing more and so we're hoping to get some of those as well that may be a give away you you want to call you say mark a when you get a copy of the conversation yes what do I have to deal you have to come in you have to have the conversation with us and then we'll give you the conversation\nBut look if you don't want to have your family put their lives on hold to take care of you then you need to have a plan in place that's our our encouragement to you have a plan in place\nBecause this is what a Harley says and I'll conclude with this he says\nWhat most people don't understand is that extended care is not a series of risks that would happen to them but rather a set of serious if not irreversible consequences that would happen to those that you love\nThis this risk\nVersus consequences that's really at the end of the day what this was about so give us a call two nine six\nFour four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five two three five nine for six five will you have this conversation with us at more financial we hope that you will\nA couple of months ago I talked about the perfect financial plan\nThe perfect financial plant is that possible we believe that it is in fact society dictates to us that whatever it is that you as an industry put together it needs to be simple it needs to be efficient\nAnd so we're happy to let you know that we have figured that out this\nLack of understanding and knowledge\nAnd that's really been one of my main desires just let's just get the word\nOut
