years and they're still fighting about money all the time and then you've got the advantage of being the head of the curve on that way to go guys or rock stars thank\nYou Don Cody and face Waco, Texas Ninety thousand dollars but it all been Seventeen months making thirty than one dirty dirty you heard the story I Love and counted down let's hear a debt free scream three to one where\nWell\nOur question that goes from ... dot com find out for yourself why ... is the number\nOne online retailer of custom window covering you get free samples free shipping\nAnd was a new promos that they run every month you'll save even more years the promo code Ramsey to get the best deals rules and restrictions apply\nToday's question comes from Christian in Florida they took out a lease on a vehicle about four months ago but for enrolling in financial ... feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return lease car\nTo the dealership or at this point I just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nWe take her car back that you own money on or signed a lease on that's a fact of late a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've reached\nThat's a fact of late a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb\nBecause they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it\nAnd the other end on repossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the different she goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the leash to yes you're being leased\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the title of your lease payments blush residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be kind of like an early pay off on the line when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nSo the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what's fake by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that\nTo KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole [noise] probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no direct she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's

April\nWas that event is then behind us in any worries are frets or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know Eighteen years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then got twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to\nOkay you twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at the ... a student loan you will have lost no ground okay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child ... you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and the other day the boy because I have a lot of girls close yeah\n\n\n\nLike if you're joining\nNow this is Dave Ramsey show [noise] open phones a AAA eight to five [noise] five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you I'm good how are you they better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding\nBrittany how are you I'm good how are you have better than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we park is our life insurance then we got part permanent impart term\nAnd of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nA ... about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and said we immediately wanted to get rid of the term are sorry the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh a permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you\nDo is it still bad shall we still didn't get the term yeah I agree on that he doesn't know much about\nDave Ramsey [laughter]\nOkay Dave Ramsey does not ever invest sounds real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance as an investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhen I Would say you need a new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you have a life insurance salesman okay the selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do it switched to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then that money where your because it was like three hundred dollars a month which I Do watch 'em and just go ahead and open up our by Roth are IRA and start getting money into that and\nThe embed mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class wasn't yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's ignorant\nRight [laughter] he's a family friend isn't T\nI'm actually one of our friends who did apparently gave them our number ... they use and for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I have never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know Twenty years Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy with until we were AB with hand\n[laughter] why don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything he sold you\nOkay [laughter] okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing okay\nThat sounds like well we're going to do I'm In the end of this week\n[noise] All right thank you for colony and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise]\nUm the people who sell investment based or whole\nLife or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are not happy\nPortfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance are not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay\nIt's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever not did get\nA horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than\nTo twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr their car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind of let a broker shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of Neal and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nUp among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the Dave Ramsey endorsement\nBut the reason they done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price\nOn term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple it takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way\nA broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with could get with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property and casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can cell phones one company like a state for a major foreign nation wide in Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and you know [noise] but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that but you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you this is the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\nFolks this is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plant you heard me or do you even have one\nWhen the world is falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere because I've done research I've done detailed research in a

my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in down times\nEnjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just ... I think I Would probably like ... it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania hey Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up\nHey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off the way to go yeah we're happy about that a decided to you know sell off some investments just to do that people kind of\nSaid well why would you do that oh the people's money ... that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great but you know hey the good problem I have is we were able to\nSell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollars that I'm trying to figure out what to do with um excuse about about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing the amount of money in the market and I'm\nFive foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental properties no outright mhm and uh and do that and maybe diversify a little more ... than I wanted to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yeah it is you know you put money mutual fund that don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter in a house they go out on you [laughter]\nYeah it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know\nBut you you put put a renter and how much they go out and you [laughter] and so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national factor I've got a bunch of it I'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else do you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return ... minus the expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return\nI are are not casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less and some of it okay but uh I our our total with increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the real estate on the other maybe double what I'm that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it I mean ... you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our\nOur real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy or a broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate to\nGet our question I'm sure they might play point with a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand\nI have I can get five home mhm uh I'm all in a hundred thousand each ... now so I don't I own them out like all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else to wanting to buy three and leverage for fifty percent yeah\nBut I don't ... you know I I think I Know your answer there on a leveraging I\nI'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I Want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three bedroom two bath for about a hundred maybe a hundred and twenty ... single family home yeah I I'm\nProbably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range in you and do three three one fifty one Seventy five right in there or rather than five ones and the only reason I'm telling you that is get a good by on whatever you by whatever it is not above binding right but the higher the clash runner\nOr the more they paying rent or they users are dealing with generally speaking\nAs a general category it's not always\nTrue I mean there's some wonderful people they rented every strategy\nBut you know people pay two dollars a month you know it's a different different type of phone you're dealing with\nAnd I've been both myself so I'm not somebody shut up and\nGet a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally and forever is with\nTime share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands\nOf timeshare owners this year alone\nThey're the best in the business because they simply have more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process but there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full\nRefund called eight for for nine nine nine ... and schedule a\nFree consultation eight for for nine nine nine or ... or timeshare exit team dot com\nFocused on the White House President Trump threatening to send the military to the southern border to stop a free thousand strong caravan of Honduran migrants intent on getting into the U.S\nImmigration has written a boiling point here at the west wing barking that explosive shouting match\nBetween two of the president's top aide to national security adviser John Bolton and the cheapest that John Kelly but you can't actually cursing at each other outside of the oval office but the White House press secretary said oh we are passionate about solving the issue of illegal immigration we are not angry at one another ABC's\nMary bruised at the White House on missing dissidents Saudi journalist ...\nAs the president left for another campaign rally acknowledge what turkey and other nations reporting for a week a journalist ... is dead\nAnd certainly looks that way to me it's very sad certainly looks that way the\nPresident saying if the Saudi Government did murder the Washington Post columnist his reaction will be severe Andy field ABC News Washington Richard can't to ABC News\nDave Ramsey show snippet\nMy wife and I just came back from three weeks in Europe so it's it's a blast go\n[noise] and the only way you're gonna be okay for his have a plan the only way you're gonna be a place for schools have a plan so you know talk to the school that you're thinking about going into and you know find out what it costs to go there\nCost of living there have you know how to live on the shape you've got the roommate faded away and\nSo you're doing Los Angeles the truth is it can be done right\nYoung single guy and the good news is you know when I'm In when I was in situations like here in [noise] I didn't mind playing really really hard on\nHard and so it might be that you say okay we'll take a Eighteen months to lay the foundation to do these two things game all [noise] no\nFor Europe and first go ...\nLet a new one on one in four one K.

old in the fifth grade and she got it okay in school but she was focused attention but surely surely I got a ... year olds are really good with people\nSo I'm like start a business or were the other great selling a channel that she may but I also want to do it but it per se\nSo your your phone is breaking up can you speak directly into it you're cutting in and I can you hear me better now Yes sir\nOkay so my ten year old she's great\nI got an ... we heard we heard I got up to that point okay started breaking up though I waited like a ... she's making can that she's making chaotic that okay\nI Want a percentage of the truck she'd go oh Shelton pot of charity held by quite shy you at the not for profit company are shaping up regular L L\nNone of the above\nOh shut up as a sole proprietorship you're over complicating a candle business within your old\nOkay to set up as a sole proprietorship you're probably not even gonna make any money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to funds a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business\nThe point is what the kid is learning they're learning work\nThey're learning interface with customers and how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... that these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate if she makes some money that's just a bonus right\nBut what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired and a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much will pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know sense\nWhen they're getting ready to have a kid go off to college is betraying you shop\nAnd understand\nWhat college costs because it is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive she goes I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it drives people understood that 'cause they simply go to school we can't afford\nAnd as you\nKnow we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side and the community a business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization is that we've had about four million students go through one of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now\nTyler Moore is with me on the line and tile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle White uh go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming can be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have a low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the different sort of like so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct\nWow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the university\nOf Tennessee and I'll tell you what am I doing a few minutes but I meant will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our campaign is called the world need more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that in her spare we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAt pursued that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're mascot right vessel decorate\nYour football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love\nIt it's a great motto egg does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool Kyle thank you man\nHappy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are a state that is very practical were state that very much\nThank you man we're happy to be happy to be a\nPartner we uh we are we are state that is very practical were state that very\nMuch um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college because sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of ... around the country a mile and chancellor and vice chancellor numerous just Tennessee and it's a constant thing and then you the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you Yes sir absolutely\nAnd we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state that you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition if a doctor or renting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south\nWe can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students success and part of that\nIs not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called themselves cowboys\nYeah that's a good size school that's not too big and nothing small and so that's that's just right those are ... just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nI Love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's a nice very cool stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the college the University of the state is buying it for every single high school\nNow if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it would be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day and now a middle school\nSite all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me that's the hardest speaking you'll ever have all this do you um but no this is Anthony O'Neill's got tough job you know but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and uh\nUm but no his Anthony O'Neill's got tough job you're all but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and you know if it wasn't and by the way that school has a grudge getting on my furniture around the structure on that one [noise] but see that's how you doing just that easy one [laughter]\nAh the world needs more cowboys I liken this is the day Ramsey show\n\nWhy in the

retirement not sure when to retire\nIf you're ready to retire picking out your retirement they might be the most difficult task of all of them\nThat's what our shows about today on it's your money I'm Jeff Logan president a premier retirement planning a wealth management here with Mike oh host Linda ... good morning good morning unhappy weekend it's always a happy weekend when we're here on the

pop star pop tart weekend\nStrawberry again to wow I Love it so how do you\nAnd the tradition now is we're kind of a pop star pop tart weekend strawberry again to wow I Love it [laughter] so how do you know when it's time to retire do you have a\nMinute I have for that one I think that's the then major question around the the water cooler and can I retire am I in the in the right position financially mentally to retire\n... well it's a lot of it is a there's a lot of things to ... a factor and it's you know it is it a magic number is it a certain a multiple of your income\nIs it ah how expensive is your bucket list all of those things really have to come into play and there really isn't a right or wrong answer the right or wrong answer is going to be just really what's right for you there is a interesting list of ten questions I'll just fly through them really quick that I kind of thought provoking about the idea of retirement like what factors did you consider before you decide to retire\nWhat happens if you retire before eight sixty five need some extra healthcare we're going to cover some of these things today\nOr can you continue to work past full retirement age and still draw Social Security a big question some people want to have their cake and eat it to want to take their Social Security as early as possible and don't want to quit working that's okay\nAh what age you just started drawing social Social Security of course that's the it depends answer of all time\nAnd how do you transition from making contributions to your accounts like four one K. and retirement accounts to\nLearning to take income that's a whole whole nother of it's kind of a paradigm shift for most people are there specific rules of thumb that you should refer to win seeing if my mistake is large enough to retire and what's that magic number we talked about that before and again another\nRule of thumb that's that's an it depends there's so many rules of thumb that I think most people ... broken they for the phone [laughter]\nAh what type of debts acceptable you know it's it's amazing to see how many retirees still have ... and you know what is not necessarily a bad thing so we're not going to just rag on people that were going to go to what it has and yeah and if you have cash flow and if it's a ... you know if it's a choice between cash flow into savings it may be smarter to keep a little bit of debt\nSo um what about if you're married or have some of the spouse soul tricks and things that you can do to choose one to take your retirement or a plan or your or your Social Security\nWell a lot of clients come in and then they're stressing over that one name decision can I retire should I retire yep and it's it's not easy and it's ... you're used to getting out and going to work every day\nI and getting that paycheck and that's one of the reasons why income and planning for guaranteed income is so important when you retire\nYou're not going to get that paycheck for your company anymore\nRight so the income now comes from a reduced amount typically it's a reduced amount from Social Security almost nobody I Know makes more than Social Security then they made in their job [noise] um do they have a pension [noise] do you have a pension that'll supplement that or do you need to take all of your income\nFrom investments and how well if you invested ... have you been along the the the way\nYou know we have a saying to you know if you achieve and be able to live out that ideal retirement life you've probably had to make a few smart decisions along the way so granted sometimes we don't make all the right decisions and sometimes we learn by our mistakes unfortunately but um\nYeah we do have to make a make some smart decisions not just while we're planning to retire but also as we're planning that transition from okay I've saved now what can I Do to make this savings become income that I can rely on\nAs long as I live how can I make sure that it pays my bills like my paycheck did\nHow can I make sure my bucket list\nItems can be taken care of within that income you know don't leave those alter chance you know how expensive is your budget and I think the biggest thing that people are probably hate to do is that budget\nYeah it's it's not as funny and exercise to do that now that\nBudget and I think the biggest thing that people are probably hate to do is that budget\n... yeah it's it's not as funny um exercise to do but knowledge is power and when you know where you're spending money what you're spending your money on it gives you more power to say is this necessary do I need this is this must stories just say I want and can you cut back and we'll talk a little bit more about that when we get into\n'em that that I Know we said it many many times when you're getting ready to retire that five years before maybe even ten years for some people it's a time where they have to do a paradigm shift between accumulating those assets and then turning them into income\nAnd if you are relying solely on assets in your retirement to draw down especially now looking what's happening in the market everybody's starting there's a little bit of panic out there\nThat if your money is not in a safe position and now they're a couple of weeks and this downturn or correction if you will and the market could wipe out or severely damaged somebody's nest eggs\nAnd they would pay out at approximately five hundred or a five percent mhm okay so let's just say it's\nIn dollars even though you only put five hundred thousand dollars in\nAnd they would pay out at approximately five hundred or a five percent mhm okay so let's just say instead of trying to grow your assets in a in a risky market to one point two five million\nFrom age sixty to Seventy hoping you'd get to that one point two five million and a stock and bond market instead taking half of that money or have a half a million five hundred thousand dollars and putting it in a in a product or of an annuity account that would guarantee fifty thousand dollars a year starting at age Seventy regardless\nJust think of what you could do that ten years how much you could save and your four one K. you not only have your fifty thousand dollars made up\nBut you also have all that extra will be ... check money in accounts that you could use it for more discretionary investment so I'm a new lease can guarantee income so that you can play with or\nRisk more of your other income it kind of help should be at a position to swing for the fences without having to be scared every day if you're\nGoing right right well and it I Want to go back as the ad touched on it at the end of the first section\nIs the first and foremost important is to identify what your expenses are and I know when at that paycheck is coming in\nYou don't really think about that budget and when that paycheck goes out you want to know where you're spending your money and that's if you started now that will be a habit that you farm going into retirement but then on the flip side identify what you're guaranteed income is going to be\nAnd see what that was like you said Jeff that balance between does it on the scale\nWhat's higher or your expenses higher or are your assets higher\nAnd do we need to save more do we need to work an extra couple of years to get there do we need to a park some of our money now into a guaranteed growth annuity that will pay you a certain amount of income later which will solve some of that problem in other words it's just basically about gaps filling\nYou know where you want to be in where you are probably two different things there's probably a few gaps and there's probably a few things that need to be um built in you know guaranteed income for example is probably the most important one\nAnd when clients come into our office that's one of the things that we do with that five point is we put their life if you will on on a spreadsheet one piece of paper\nAnd showing them and sometimes the answer to that question can I retire in his shirt you're going to be okay it looks like everything's good and sometimes that question is answered with ... you might need to consider working a little bit longer\nI had to do extra saving to put you in a better position for retirement\nAnd the best news is like the one we just had a couple of days ago where they came in and they said you know we think we can live on sixty thousand in retirement we know we're probably going to have to work another ten years and when it came down to it we found out that we could actually create a hundred thousand dollar a year plus income for them\nGuaranteed mhm and they only have to work six warriors\nFeel that the type of thing that you really love to hear because I don't think they believe that could be done but\nThey were also believing based on these rules of thumb taking risk into consideration realizing that market crash realizing they couldn't go all out\nBut when we showed them how about a fifty fifty split between guaranteed assets principle protected assets could guarantee them enough income that they wouldn't have to worry about the other half of their assets or that they could use those other half of the assets in a more discretionary matter\nThat they had enough to live on a six figure income for life and not work till they're Seventy and that was that was that those are one of the best moments in my life is to see how happy people get when they realize that they're not doomed to this\nYou know decade or more of of work that they're actually closer to retirement than they thought they were so you know if you want to see if you're ready or to see if you can maybe retire earlier than expected that's another positive thing\nOf of work that they're actually closer to retirement than they thought they were so you know if you want to see if you're ready or to see if you can now maybe retired earlier than expected that's another positive thing that may come out of that retirement readiness review\nAll you have to do to get one is called five to ... to one seven eighty five sixty six and we'll talk about those five points to retirement your income play on your investment plan your tax plan your healthcare plan and your legacy or your um estate plan\nSo before we go into our next break maybe we could just talk about a couple of the strategy is to create more savings before retirement for those of you are\nThat's actually where I have is going to go that if you do get the answer to that question is can act can retire and it's no aggressively looking at saving more\nAnd that doesn't mean saving aggressively that's what I mean oh I got to buy more apple and Amazon I don't want to you know we're not talking about aggressively investing we mean I'm I'm ... much more later ...\nThat far when Kay if you're over fifty are you taking advantage of that catch it edition if you're single you can add sixty five hundred a ... a year or married couple\nIt's around Thirteen thousand that's just your IRA yeah those numbers are up to about twenty four thousand dollars if\nYou're talking about a four O. one K. or at your employer and make sure you're taking the match and make sure you're maximizing those savings\nI started a special account that many goes in for only in the future not touching it and you'd\nBe amazed at how quickly does account for ... hidden collecting change may Wednesday that little quaint thing and it was a thousand dollars in ...\nIt's amazing how fast little things can add up\nTo use your magic number is coming up next Sunday to many more strategies on how to create for you time\n\nMm\nWhether you're already retired or planning to retire Jeff ... from your return offending their wealth management will help you maximize your income minimize your taxes ... protect what you have more a lifetime to achieve now back to his your money\nPaycheck at that time again for your financial hit that week yes it is and we're\nGoing to talk about what is better than bonds were to look at an kept fixed index annuities and would like to offer you a copy of the article that I'm basing this tip on and it's called the better than bonds a look at and kept fixed indexed annuities well for safety in performance you might find that\nThis new asset classes not new but it's relatively new fixed index annuities may be a better choice than bonds in fact I recently did a tip of the week which talked about Roger it would send\nWho Yale professor who is digested all kinds of information over the years about Wall Street and trends and things as actually jumped ... I hate to say about jumped the wall street chip\nAnd kind of got on the fixed indexed annuity bandwagon with some of his own index is that uh that he's used in 'em and likes finds out that index annuities can actually enhance the returns and keep money say\nBack to the article you know what to investors really want they want and gross they want safety and they want liquidity and then they want to give whatever's left of who they want how they want when they want right well\nUnfortunately it's kind of like a cake and eat it too scenario where it's hard to have all three\nThings in the same product\nUsually give up a little piece of one rather than the other for example the bond market or if you're going to compare this new a fixed index annuity with bonds the bond market is a little bit skittish right now as interest rates are being raised by the fed and is the stock market\nThe bonds the bond market is a little bit skittish right now as interest rates are being raised by the fed and is the stock market becomes a little more favorable bonds to become a little less favorable and they will lose value in what we call a bond bear market which may be going into\nSo how do you put your money in a safe place still get some growth reasonable growth and don't lose money\nWell the answer is well I'm going to use an example um the answer is probably best put to put to use by looking at a ... an example by jak Marion jak Marines that guy that goes back a few years and he\nUm is kind of the guru a fixed index annuities he's got a champion the idea to the financial world as an alternative for safe money\nUm he chose a fifty year timeframe from January first Nineteen sixty to January first two thousand and ten and what he did as he compared how one thousand dollar investment in the S. and P. would have performed under three scenarios one with no dividends one with the evidence and one was no dividends no and no losses\nSo the first two scenarios followed the ups and downs of the market one that the evidence one didn't now obviously the one with the evidence paid more I'll just give you the numbers with no dividends the basic nominal essence ... five hundred grew that one thousand dollars over that fifty or time period to Eighteen thousand six hundred and Fifteen dollars\nThe second with the dividends obviously the dividends over the years of average about two percent but you compound that two percent over fifty years and it becomes quite a difference that ending balance was eighty four thousand two hundred and sixty dollars compared to the Eighteen thousand six hundred I just mentioned\nThe third if you could have no dividends added you could have just the upside in the market and none of the downside\nThe balance became one hundred and Seventy nine thousand six twenty four so which one would you rather have\nWell it's kind of a no brainer do the math on that one hundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars is a lot more than Eighteen thousand dollars and so I Would rather have no downs and just ups\nOr what have you had just half of the ups in the markets and know downs would that still have been better sure it would have been better than the first two scenarios and that's how a fixed indexed annuity works\nThe fixed index annuity keeps your principles safe it uses the interest that they make on your money to leverage the index such as the S. and P. five hundred the Dow NASDAQ or any other index that it may choose\nAnd by the way you get to pick what index your interest rate is credited on and there is a formula that the company offering these indexed annuities will offer you you get to choose and you get to pick you can look at history you can look at current data and make your own decision but if you get half of the upside of the market and none of the downsides chances are over a period of\nBe careful and remember that if you ... co sign on student debt or if you just decided to go back to school to take on a new career retirement whatever it is just make sure you can uh a payoff that that that they will come out and get it from you if you can't or if the person that should be paying a cat\nAnd I looked at another did some a little bit of research I've Thirteen kept to manage I'm not going to go through all Thirteen but um there's one that I Love and I use [laughter]\nMyself is that transfer the balance transfer at taking high interest rate on an out cards and moving them to a Fifteen month twelve month zero interest ... a great way to start as long as you're paying those off and not adding more another\nCar take advantage of those special rates I I'm a little less in favor of doing the ... of the home equity line of credit at a lower rate in order to pay off consumer debt because\nYou are stuck with that debt on your home that does ... and and if for whatever reason you can't pay that you know you don't want to lose your home over it you know I I hate to say it but I'd rather walk away from a credit card debt and not lose my home\nThan stack everything on my home and end up coming up short of losing my home that's an so that's another thing that you have to be really careful on is making sure you don't want to take advantage of that oh look at all the equity I have my home I can just pick up on my desk but now you have a bigger mortgage payment you know make sure your cash is going to support that in good and bad times or you may jeopardize that homeownership\nBut that was another one we get a lot of questions from people that they want to pay off their house before they go into retirement and now even though that that that's a better debt than credit card debt\nI Would rather have a hundred thousand dollars in savings for a rainy days and pay off my house with that hundred thousand dollars hadn't have zero savings if I had a ready and I'll just give you a quick example if we have time as as my dad you know he had a stroke they had a hundred thousand dollars and\nI had a Randy and I'll just give you a quick example if we have time as as my dad you know he had a stroke they had a hundred thousand dollars in savings and they end up spending it on his care they could not and they had a house that was paid off for four hundred thousand dollars in California that they could not get a loan on why because he was invalid he could not ...\nSo they basically used all that money to spend on their house they had very little Web and ended up spending it for his health care and mom was left in kind of dire straight so because if you're

just come up when people come in and talk about whether they're ready to retire will I have enough money will I live on how much can I spend that much and I know it's been how much should I say what should I take Medicare what should I take Social Security lots and lots of questions in the last year we are going to tackle is Social Security that's a big question\nAnd the point quite often or kill it is important question what is the most important things people need to know about Social Security [noise]\nWell the biggest question is when should I take my Social Security and the answer that question is it depends everybody is different everybody's circumstances are unique and that\nI did I loaded you up with kind of a loaded question yet there is no\nMost important as what they are all important you know when should you take it is is really going to make a difference if you take an early ... you can lose twenty five percent of your monthly benefit but you get a few extra years of income\nIf you hate your job it might be okay to take it early if you take it later and able to work in ... four five six seven even ten years or eight years between age sixty two in Seventy eight years of income and\nAble to work an extra four five six seven even ten years or eight years between age sixty two in Seventy eight years of income and an increase from your full retirement age of thirty two percent per month or per year in actual income so\nWhen you when you take it as a makes a big difference on your lifetime income and there's also there's other things you have to factor in\nWhat about my spouse can they take a spouse or benefit what if I die early does she get my window benefit is is waiting smarter for her if I die early and sometimes it's not just our own decision that we need to consider is that of a spouse in and out of our our entire financial situation so\nRight in the even are you still working 'cause if you were still working you're getting in income now you're still putting into this as the security but that also does have a random vacations on how much have yourself a security as tax\nThat is true as well and if you're working before age sixty six or ... or your full retirement age which ever it is\nA once you start making a little over Fifteen thousand a year they start withholding some of your Social Security benefits\nAnd and I'm going to say that more often than not the it depends answer on if you're working and you still want to claim Social Security it's better to claim Social Security after your full retirement age so that you can keep it all ... you don't have to give some of it back because the IRS or the Irish the Social Security department\nDoesn't just hand you the lump sum that they've withheld they just increase the amount you get over the rest of what they consider your lifetime might be so\nUh you know if you have to take Social Security early be very careful on understanding the consequences of that and how much they're going to withhold and how you'll get that money back because that is money that isn't you are entitled to you put into the system and you should be able to get back so\nAgain it's one of those mathematical things do the math figure out what makes sense to you and figure out what your lifestyle dictates\nWell and you mentioned and married couples that there are a couple of other strategies that a married couple of can use that ... that a single person doesn't had as far as taking that spouse will benefit now too that were really nice to married couples that that have been gone for the last couple of years or that Ireland suspending restricted application\nOh she got to tell everybody what they can't\nHave that owned by that still some people think that that's still in play that there is that that spouse will benefit can actually be beneficial at when one spouse should take their their Social Security even taking it early and then getting that has ... half of the husbands later on\nWhen he starts taking his so\nBut you have to be a certain age so that's why things coming for the Social Security ... will tell you if you're in that ballpark where you can take advantage of that loophole I wouldn't call it a loophole would just take advantage of the the way the law is you know I I had seen a loophole 'cause it's not like we are cheating anything we're just thing adage of of the rules\nAnd then there's other benefits rather strategies are single and and divorced or you have an ax so there is power benefit it all depends on your situation right\nSo remember even if you don't have your own benefit or your own benefit isn't that much you can take half of your ... up to half of your spouse's benefit or up to half of an ex spouses benefit that may benefit you\nAnd uh the way the widow benefit works um is you can take that as early as age sixty if your spouse has pre deceased do and would have been at the age they could've taken Social Security\nUm when it comes to income planning keep in mind that not all of us die\nIn the same year right as a as a couple right and if one of us out lives the other by a significant amount of years uh consider the will benefit the widow or the survivor gets the better of the two benefits as well it may be smart for one of the spouses to wait especially the one sometimes even the most unhealthy spouse\nBetter of the two benefits as well it may be smart for one of the spouses to wait especially the one sometimes even the most unhealthy spouse to wait so that the healthier surviving spouse

espouse\nThat well that's probably the things that come into play that or the ... I guess probably the more confusing elements that people need to iron out is how to make sure that we work it out with our spouses are surviving spouse those are some of the things that are kind of the unknowns but really need to be included in a plan\nAnd you need to plan for the contingencies the what ifs I mean that's that's really what retirement planning is nothing is certain nobody has a crystal ball you don't have your death date you don't have your ... or your death certificate in your hand yet\nHow do you know how long you're going to live and what you're going to need so a lot of big questions now the last um besides um Social Security we've got that health care question", "show_name": "Doug Stephan's Good Day", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "21"}
