would leave earlier if someone new gets confirmed and apparently according to White House sources because Brinker has already gone through Senate confirmation she was the U.S ambassador ambassador to

were new from all the songs are on it it was pretty much that was the way these producers did things and Phil Spector was notorious for it but there are many others who are didn't treat the musician

sending the signing ceremony a kid rock said quote this is a great start to protect songwriter producers engineers the unsung heroes behind a lot of the songs that are out there\nPeople like me who

episode of the show five contestants work with music cruises and a recording artist to perfect tunes that they have already written\nOne winter per episode will have his or her song released as the

[laughter]\nAnd it's fun I think he probably could go just for the heck of it for a moment because you're just to see if you can find Hansen's farm um if you just Google it or maybe ... ... it's ... oh and H. A. N. S. O. N. uh aunts and farm dot com I think it is\nAnyway farmers' markets are important you can shop there I Know they have some of the best farmers markets in California where I Am part of the year and it's a it's a business\nBut maybe even better plan now this is what my daughter did with my grandson to plant a small garden\nAnd watched the seeds grow so he will understand where food comes from so many youngsters they don't know where the milk comes from where the fruit comes from where the vegetables that they don't like to eat come from so playground\nGuarded there's something that my brother and his fiance had a really beautiful organic garden that they've been working on for a couple of years now and it's so satisfying I see how happy they are when they get\nYou know big leaves of kale and and when they get a little baby eggplant that grows and I think there if I had you know actual like soil room I Would probably want to try it out too because it just I see how much satisfaction and fun they had with it and when you get to eat something that you've grown yourself if it's a really cool feeling\nYeah it is I'm just looking at are Hansen's a foreigner extras on that website yeah I don't see any of that which is not smart on their part [laughter]\n[noise] um anyway as the uh the well is that there are pictures just what the activities are that are going on but there is a in terms of\nWhere you can go for lots of weekend activities during the month of October a lot of these family farms have big celebrations and\nA half so they have a hard farm that kind of stuff but it's a ... the agra tourism business has become big and as change the shape of some farms not necessarily for the better as far as I'm concerned just kind of\nLet yourself in on what goes on it used to be that so many people who are connected in one way or another the farm that's not the case today 'cause only to present actually less than two percent of the population grows the food for the other Ninety eight percent many people are not as strange necessarily but they just aren't around\nLess than two percent of the population grows the food for the other Ninety eight percent many people are not as strange necessarily but they just aren't around farmers farmers markets major big resurgence\nOf that school if you want to know what is going on on the farm you can every week we have a different story than retailing I have some thoughts and the news of what's going on in the farm so the podcast again can be found in American family farmers show dot com each week this week\nWe had a lady who wrote a book about a cow\nAnd ah I was happy Carroll wasn't so happy when she was listening to me call the cows come\nThe book is called Columbus was okay with it my ears were in a little bit of had\n... they were bleeding throughout comments please\nRight so that's a that's why\nI wanted to spend emitted with the all of you talking about uh the situation on donations\nThe kinds of things that are uh that you ought to probably pay attention to in terms of what's going on ah the um\nThe there are so many things happening this weekend to call attention to what the what the results of the of the um\nI'm just had lost ... story sorry about that as you can do and it's funny how we can now we're so I'm moving from one screen to the I got three screens in front of me and I'm moving bang bang boom I've gotten actually pretty good at it [laughter]\nWhen in fact somebody pulls a plug some stuff just stop so I don't want to do this anymore\nSo if you want to donate to hurricane relief efforts may I suggest there may Victoria you can pull up a couple that you'd like to suggest as well as far as making donations are concerned\nAre the folks that UNICEF interestingly enough\nHave been supportive of uh some of these events and that's not a bad place in the United nations the children's emergency fund is what it is and it seems to get more recognition this time of year because a lot of people collect money for UNICEF on Halloween instead of collecting candy like money or maybe both\nAre so they're involved in this uh there are um a couple of other things\nAre children and families at risk is another good organization\nSave the children is a a good organization as I've said before I'm only going to say at once here and now I keep beating the drum the red cross is not a good place to give your money to they have\nWay too much money they don't manage it well and a lot of it doesn't get to where you want it to go so you really want to help these people are victims the survivors have you seen\nSome of the pictures of the towns especially the coastal towns this was the biggest storm\nOf the century if not you know it was very powerful hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds at one point during the day on Wednesday or it is really a disaster down there three hundred and Seventy five thousand people are out of their homes\nA and a lot of people just I mean you look at the pictures we've seen so much of this though does it seem that way this year it was just me\nFor some reason sounds underwater and just things ripped out on the ground and it just seems more I'm more either that or are more conscious of it what do you think that\nWell I think that we're ... I I don't know that it's more because we had well no you know what I think because Hurricane Harvey ... it had a lot of flooding and damage and things like that in ... in ah in Houston so we all saw that and I think with the east coast when you see Florence how how how much rain there was just ...\nI in Houston so we all saw that I I think with the east coast when you see Florence how how how much rain there was just everywhere and then all the floodwaters and the storm surge\nAnd then to have a hurricane Michael can then right after with the same thing but you know more of it I think it just it it's just a really unfortunately times\nPhenomenon and it's it's probably going to take a really long time for all of that damage to be assessed and for it to be on the road to recovery\nYeah well I don't know what the solution is some people say we got to change the way we live on the planet fossil fuels all that stuff\nThat may be part of it but there is this just the way the cycle goes\n... and you can throw your hands over there and say oh well can we do some of your body well there are more people who live in these areas that's the focus on the devastation is probably more a back in the era or back where we were talking about\nFarming being twelve thousand years old or more or you can be sure that during that era on any coastal area there were no houses\nOn because they knew to stay away from it plus they couldn't Bernie food they couldn't survive along the coast unless they were they knew how to fish and that was well into you know they\nNearly of folks on the planet or there's some people say human life goes back thirty thousand years some people say it goes like three hundred thousand years however the first person to walk on the planet didn't know the fish in the ocean\nAnd there may have been because of my philosophy okay everybody to get ready to roll your eyeballs back now that people who are here came from other planets be interesting but it'd be interesting to know what are the food sources are\nJust thinking about uh Matt Damon being on Mars and how he grew as food from from the ... the ... yeah yeah so how did people originally figure out how to grow food it's really where the first scene kimbro you ever wonder stuff like that or am I the only one of these crazy enough to wonder\nStuff like that perhaps it is that I don't know what is that you might be I could be\nA moderately unique and my point of view and I guess that's what makes for a an interesting DJ be show a here's something that I Want to promote because I think it's very good for you most of the things that we talk about here that I talk about any way the things I promote or things that are good for your natural homeopathic stuff\nOr things like my pillows use the ...

she represented our country really well I think she was always poised and very well spoken to and I think it's going to be I think she's leaving some big shoes to fill\nWelfare and the people who are up for at least one of 'em anyway I think the story is not her stepping down its who replaces her and this ah ... Mrs or the sister of Susan G common and the one who's been running that foundation\nAnd stealing money I probably shouldn't say stealing 'cause she was legitimately given a check\nFor hundreds of thousands of dollars every year I has reaped millions over the years since this thing was organized and the money has not given if you if you are donating wondering is it that Brinker is that her name\nSomething like that yeah I I I find her to be one of the worst examples is one of the reasons that people are suspicious about many of the five oh one C. three as many of the not for profit organizations this Susan ... comment is an absolute rip off\nAnd people who support her I I get a kick out of a matter of fact I said something nicely to a stewardess on an American flag because they supported last year\nDuring October isn't it pink isn't pink what's this month the oh yeah there was like yeah spraying cancer awareness so yeah yeah\nSo uh when they go up and down the aisle Nasser donations I said I Would give to some legitimate organization that was helping women who are suffering from breast cancer and nobody's been any closer to it than I have my sister had it in my wife died of it\nUh so I'm listening I Know and I know because of what I ...

the Senate is that another ...\nBrinker has already been confirmed because she was in I'm\nIn ... was subjected to Hungary under George W so I think if she already went through the Senate confirmation so I think that might be part of the reason a she's a woman and I think it might be part of the reason why she she would pretty much sail through a Senate confirmation\nI'm guessing that ah that she will not do the kind of work that Nikki Haley has done a good job to adapt as governor and but you know she's ... like you said is that a tough ... years\nWell but they are and the headline was all about our finances so she had the same financial difficulty a lot of his head why are we focusing on that\nScale because she also mentioned that tale that she wanted to get back into the private
