clinically proven power swabs this risk free challenge is for people who smile has been yellow by coffee\nOr right would be the question a lot of people have but focusing on just having enough food or one in nine people around the world experience chronic hunger\nGo back to the end of World War two when the un came into existence they recognize food that is a privilege but as a right I think that that's justifiable I don't see why there would even be a discussion about it frankly anyway that October sixteenth Nineteen Seventy nine fast forward the un created world food day\nTo day observance to draw attention to those who are hungry we have fourteen million youngsters every day or every night to go to bed hungry in this country that seems inexcusable especially when we go back to some of the stupid rules\nIn cities and communities around the country uh restaurants they want to give extra food to the homeless can't\nBecause of laws that make no sense to anybody with any common sense whatsoever\nSo here's where you can do to help today and going forward local food banks always need food in our country one in seven people rely on food banks as a primary or supplemental food source my God\nMany of these are working families who don't because of under employment or not being paid enough to satisfy the needs of our family can't afford groceries\nNeed the have help with their families needs the top requested items for food banks are healthy non perishable items high in protein like canned beans peanut butter rolled oats low sodium soups and vegetables and canned tuna\nAnd also one of the things you can do today is support your local farmer the family farmer small scale farmer\nA lot of family farmers unable to produce a variety of crops needed for their own survival these days and without that support they suffer from malnutrition themselves that happens when we were talking about what happened was it last week we were talking about the farmers in China\nAnd what's going on with them it's really a very interesting is like the old days of futile isn't in Europe\nSo here's something you can do on were food day go shop at local farm the locavores support family farms\nBe some we'll talk about on our American family farmer pod cast as we care and by the way you can listen to what's going on on the American family farm as I Try to support the American family farmer\nWe have a weekly podcast that you can find an American family farmers show dot com want to know what's going on you want to listen if you're a locavore\nYou want to know what's going on the farm how you can support the farm we have lots of good stories about successes on family farms that's where we do the show to help people who are on farms to need a little more help coming up with ideas that's what that's all about\nAnd uh then the other thing you can do to observe world food day is to raise money yourself\nTypically a number of food drives today and this week\nIf you don't know of any local food drives maybe you can organize one yourself great lesson it would be a good elementary and middle school lesson maybe for all schools actually teachers who are listening to this right now on your way to school may I suggest that you put together a food drive organized one\nIn your classroom and then you can give the kids are great lesson but all the food the school bus and bring it down to a local food drive and show the\nIn your classroom and then you can give the kids are great lesson but all the food and a school bus and bring it down to a local food drive and show

would be something that\nOught to go on every day because this is a problem not just today I just this week not just this month every day pretty much everywhere even\nIf you're in advance living in an advanced country like ours are the problem is a it's really pretty disgusting actually that we would have in our country so people can't afford the food and instead of throwing it out\nFade into the pigs you feed it to people who need it that's it was it the homeless people are going up and down the street in garbage cans and you can give them\nLeft over food in a restaurant but yet we can let them walk up and down the street certainly not a garbage can my God whoa like\nWell they can get what they want as long as we're not fond civil forgiving than you know that that sort of the stupid

attack and how your pet died and how old they are also important factors regarding how you're going to react\nGrief confusion anger killed depression or all normal typical reactions\nRegarding anger as with any loss it's not uncommon for a person suffering the lost a pet to find someone something to blame even if that means blamed themselves you know it's very difficult saying goodbye to our best friend because the relationship is so close a lot of people have family that they can count on but very often friends and family don't understand the relationship of the pet\nAnd the pet guardian and that often causes confusion and anger so if you lose a pet and you don't have that support system check with the local humane society there are many many societies now that offer courses and groups for people that lost their pet to get them to the ... like it works are more next time\nThis was an announcement for all people who want to take a risk free challenge to white and their teeth in five

wildfires in California have caused power companies to shut off power to consumers to prevent more\nWildfires Pacific gas and electric\nSaid it would begin preemptively turning off power to some eighty seven thousand customers in extreme fire risk areas this past weekend as of\nYesterday the company had cut power to fifty nine thousand customers in the Sierra foot hills and the north bay communities outages last until I think later this week unprecedented move\nPart of the power companies new strategy to try to reduce wildfires\nAfter being blamed for causing more than a dozen fires in October of last year remember how bad the fires were last year all have this time who man\nWhat a mess Cal fire's says investigators discovered some of the wildfires were caused by trees\nFalling on to power lines well yeah if I were there I'd want to be part of a lawsuit against Pacific gas and electric because all they have to do is higher tree companies to go up and clean off that's what they do all around the country the utilities hire\nThe tree companies to go around and clean the branches off the trees oh this will be avoided if they put the power lines underground but the Jew damn cheap there too worried about what the stock holders would cause the stock holders to do it so that's why they don't do it other than a new developments as they put the all electric underground\nUm but anyway uh\nThere was a red flag warning for much of northern California this past week or so because of the strong winds and the low humidity and so under the circumstances here in California you know what I'm Talking about I Would settle for that for a second though my wouldn't that just arbitrarily turn your power off\nIn ... I'm paying really yeah right exactly why that must force people out of their homes so yeah that's an expense like what are you listening to check into a hotel because they are on your power off yeah thanks\nA lot right here's what's going on with attorney general Jeff Sessions\nAdding violent crime prosecutors to the U.S attorney's office in Chicago have created a gun crimes prosecution team because the locals can't seem to handle it so the feds have stepped in\nWow this is interesting remember when the president ordered sessions couple of weeks ago to work with law enforcement to reduce crime there and they've investigated and they found the\nAttorney the Chicago da so corrupt the police department is so corrupt that is one of the reasons by the way that a Dick Wolf decided to produce those shows that are on I think it is Wednesday or Thursday night on NBC have three Chicago made Chicago fire Chicago police\nAnd it was a way to bring attention around to other it doesn't by the way the Chicago police show doesn't pay the Chicago police in a really good light\nInteresting the way that they're portrayed fire yes med yes\nPolice no not so much and anyway so I thought it was interesting that the FBI announced the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms\nAssigned five violent crime coordinators to project safe neighborhoods which is what they're doing the feds have a daily review of firearm are so basically there's no need any more of a love which Goggle police department because they're so bad the feds are taking over everything looks like lists\nBasically there's no need any more of a local Chicago police department because they're so bad the feds are taking over everything looks like what\nIs it realistic ally what are the Fed's going to be able to really do unless you're just driving up and down in these neighborhoods where people get shot every thirty seconds writing what can you actually do\nIn and even what can the police do you know it's it's there's a lot of gang violence so I don't know if I ... at least in New York City a lot of police I think probably look the other way and figure out you know figure all the criminals who killed themselves off but maybe that's the same attitude in Chicago but the problem is just so many innocent people get caught in the crossfire\nYeah you're right in a moment we're going to tell you the story of the youngest woman on the Forbes four hundred list the richest Americans of next year in the D.

the president and the first lady made that trip to the panhandle area of Florida yesterday they were on the ground for several hours and they also took an aerial tour to get a look up from the sky of what the devastation looks like\nAnd the president took a walking tour of one particular heart had neighborhood and lean haven Florida so bit inland not right there on the coast and ah\nLike Panama City or Mexico beach which is certainly getting a lot of attention\nFor the damage that's been there the president did his walking tour of a neighborhood you know made his way down the street where house after house just had trees down in the front yard front yards just ripped apart covered in mud and some of the houses obliterated on cars and trucks were crushed by\nDebris or by the trees that had fallen ... the most part though the president was hearing a message from people that they were getting what they need that that they were very happy with aid and supplies that were very quickly brought to their area one of the big challenges a no surprises that there's no power\nThere wasn't a cell phone service so if you're trying to start the process of\nRecovery and rebuilding its really

months after a tweet thought by many to be racist got Roseanne fired from the show that she created\nOn the day be uh we'll find out the fate of Roseanne character and then we'll see how the ratings do without that a controversial star\nWell what happens when you get a great big soundtrack you get the number one out in the country that's what we can say about Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper they've got the number one album right now thanks to a star is born and there's the Trump effect fading his interview on sixty minutes and then pull the big numbers that uh we used to seeing for the president and presidents in general\nAnd how are the numbers for Alec Baldwin\nTalk show why you didn't know that there was an Alec Baldwin talks off there is a debuted this weekend on the cw [noise] it was the lowest rated broadcast\nWhich will be a great choice to do some driving in and then some flying after that where where you're going to be saving hundreds if not not close to five hundred dollars going to Europe or person\nMhm well we can see that again would have an advantage to getting to where you're going but there's you know Americans don't really know much about mass transit compared to what the what we're seeing Europe\nOh no I just got back from Europe it's you know mass transit is just part of the way of life there it's amazing to see how many people are on mass transit and these particular cases when you have airports within a couple of our radius it's it's\nNot ... it's pretty palatable if you can save some money to do a little bit of driving you know driving or sitting at the airport um you know I'm not sure it's half a dozen of one sixth of the other in some cases so it might be worth your while to check into that it's really about being flexible and\nYou know there's a lot of resources on the Internet a fare compare we have them um that can help you find some deals um\nBut you have to be proactive in and be looking in and looking for those great deals and making sure\nYou sort of adhere to the the simple rules like flying on the cheapest days like today are not buying your ticket inside at thirty days which most people do by the way over over two thirds do in playing rather than airlines hands if you do that\nAnd a couple of extra cities you could probably find a deal from time to time take one extra triple your that's what it's all about\nAll right well in terms of uh I you know if I was to go to Europe I think the only time being a vehicle car rather would probably be a taxi or something like that but ah you and your experiences are fun country to drive around\nWell it's a little harrowing for example to be in the United kingdom and come around a left hand turn when Lori\nIsland that aside I wouldn't do that\nAnd you're like I'm going to go they have a lot of heads Bush's on the side of the road I I had to scratch up one of my rental cars a few times\nWhen I was planning on doing that now there are\nCountries like France I just got back from France they do drive on the proper side of the rest of\n'em they do that in Spain as well Germany is fun to do as well um so there are places where it's worthwhile to to get into a car and the the cool thing about a car is is that it's they let you sort of stop and go wherever you want where you're not on mass transit in on a train where you have to sort of map everything out though there are some advantages\nTo a car or in many cases are a lot of these cities have ... and it's not too expensive to go out there already minutes\nI'm away from the city and once you get thirty or forty minutes away depending on what direction you go to some of these cities you can get in some really fun\nAreas and get get to interact with the locals now have you driven on the autobahn\nA little bit
