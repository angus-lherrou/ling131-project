of bugs me that's not being talked about statistically one in three women is a victim of sexual assault now that's what the numbers are in America and that's reported sexual assault so we ... you could say that it's probably more than that\nBut only for in one hundred\nNails are falsely accused so if you think about those numbers when when I hear Trump and all these other male blow hards talking about that one senator who posted the champagne glasses congratulating Brett saying oh it's not beers for hashtags beers for breath but champagne will have to do\nMaking fun of the fact that you know Kavanaugh said he liked to beer and\nIt's still very much the old boys' network that's happening in Washington and they're still down and talk about but to hear them talk about the poor males who are being accused now that's the only four out of one hundred that are ever accused falsely but one in three at least women are actually sexually assaulted\nThe ... we we have to stop focusing on\nThe poor men who were accused yes it's terrible if someone's falsely accused of course no one's endorsing that\nBut we really need to look at the real problem is the guys who are actually sexually assaulting women and that's that's where as a woman I get really frustrated well and I'm getting hired here in men going oh well poor Brett Kavanaugh what he went higher well Dr Howard I got it what about all the other women\nSo there is that to be sure\nAnd there is the the the the conversation if that's what it is is it getting us someplace or not is it action or talk\nThey were looking for I'm looking for action I'm not looking for talk I'm done with the talk I'm done with listening to all these people and their BS whether is this jerk with champagne and beer these comments that are showing sensitive that are so unnecessary that or you know it's the typical up yours I'm In charge and you're not\nThat doesn't work it and it will not work\nBut there is the the the ... that has come over our country part of it\nAnd this is not about fixing the blame of fixing the problem but there's a mobile lays there is an acceptance\nFor a long time lots of these judges\nLike the judge that we talked about and a stand for the case of that kid that to get off got away with raping a that it was just the whole thing so stunk at the stench around that judge ... around that kidding around his father and around that whole incident\nWhich is very indicative in my opinion very indicative of the sort of thing that does go on that tries that that people try to bury so the the population that community took action they got rid of the judge\nThat was a very ... yeah exactly right so the conversation has gone on a not long enough but in this particular instance this particular case there is nothing more they can come out of it it's it's it's trying to\nEducate people and uh that ... that starts at the youngest level that starts at home and so many families are broken today there isn't a good strong positive male and female and it's a representation at home\nOr especially in minority community and so these kids grow up around people who may or may not have a good background but they influence them and so\nThese kids grow up around people who may or may not have a good background but they influence them and so\nThere's a whole we can keep digging and digging and digging to find the problem and the solution maybe as one step at a time there has been certainly a lot of positive action that has come out of this in terms of the protests and that sort of thing\nBut in the the particular incident that we're talking about\nI think we've struggled with this\nI Would like it if you are not there but he is and so are we going to spend all of our time and energy trying to get him out of the Supreme Court\nOr are they going to try to figure than him it is ... and right yeah and that and that's\nI understand that that you know the women's march is going to arrive at court today in this first day of protest I get that\nAnd I'm all for protesting I'm I'm more like you know I I Want to see some results\nAnd the problem is we can't ... you know when we say believe survivors we have to believe survivors because there's an entire generation of young girls who watch Dr Ford testify just like the generation before who watched Anita Hill testify nothing happened it didn't change anything\nThat sets such a bad example for women who don't come forward later on because they've seen those examples where do we deal if I get on the ... not that I think\nThere is I think there is a difference between Anita Hill and the circumstance they are the results are basically the same but I think a lot of things have happened with me too movement and some other things that have been generated a they were slow to come as a result of the hill and there were a lot of people who still\nYou can poke holes in either side of any argument just go to her courtroom for a day and listen to the trailer watch some of the court dramas on TV uh you can see how things you can find in friends in in your window and but you gotta have proof in order to make\nChange see that's the problem though so many of these cases are people in a room\nI Know people in a room you can't ... if he said she said\nBut the ... the the real problem though it's not just poking holes in whose side of the story it it's ... it's just the precedent that it's set of having a look at the all those gymnasts when aren't there three hundred\nFemale Jim ... yeah the one after that ... live yeah yeah almost every one of them had reported his sexual assault to the to hire their Jeff Jeff somebody else and nobody did anything they do what happened way\nPeople after the fact that we're all those people get fired and they should have been if they weren't I Want to know if those people\nWill ever connected to Larry Nassar apparently has been fired but look at how many years it took you know how many years it took for that and all those girls who came forward hundreds of them\nAnd it ... and it wasn't until the me too movement that really pushed it into the spotlight and people said All right we can't ignore this anymore it's a systemic problem ... court is in college campuses across the country it's it's such a much bigger problem than Brett Kavanaugh\nFor that is very true but again back to the action and what we can do that is positive to be a focused on changing so we\nWork at it but I'm gonna I'm just off of a cabinet I'm tired of listening to the conversation it is and you're making a lot of noise going to the Supreme Court today are protesting\nA isn't going to do a damn bitter good uh I I'm with you and you hear me talk about this all the time on the air I Want to have I Do like protesting protesting has a lot of value but at this point the protests all of the information\nHas been heard everybody's been heard on this pretty much all sides all angles a\nBut likely go ahead go ahead\nEverybody's been hurt on this pretty much all sides all angles I'm\nRight but likely go ahead no doubt that the people at gun\nWell I just think that we've ... we've exhausted we're getting exhausted emotionally or physically um I think you know I Know people who have been so upset about this they physically gotten ill\nUm I wouldn't be surprised you don't feel that well and I wouldn't be surprised if some of it is the emotion that has worked its way in coal catered itself into your psyche and you know it's the mind spirit in mind body connection in your mind is on something and it upset you than it affects you physically\nOr I think that it has affected a lot of people physically and emotionally um but as sadly it's a it's not the worst case of this women have gone through this and they've been killed\nAs a result of these some of these altercation so ah I just this we have a sickness there's a mental health side to this that we are not we're not dealing with mental health issues in this country at all when you have a problem with gets done squat\nUh and so we spend all this money on weaponry we're going to be the biggest toughest guys on the block or you know we are able to blow the world up above Seventy times over so I always spend some of that money uh and and are in place it in a\nIn a position or in some use\nThat has value or to help us become a healthier\nCountry instead of this is very this these things are very difficult on our mental health uh\nWell they are and you know I don't I'm not a parent but if I if I had a daughter heading off to college\nI Would be pretty scared these days you know there's we we just I don't know if we talked about it on the show but I Know a couple of weeks ago that the device is the head of the education department\nShe just rolled back some ... some regulations that were there and that were put in place to protect girls on campus an off campus if there are sexually assaulted now she wrote it back and it's no longer if you're off campus the school has no obligation to protect you\nLeaving in off campus housing that's part of the school it's still if you are sexually assaulted\nThen you you know you can go to the local police and see what that does but there's no you have no recourse with your own school if you're and is there is no there is that\nA lot of threats against her life she's now upped\nHer so I Want to be hiring there have been doing for even Donnie ... actually saying it's another person\nThat should never been there All right so we got to move on or it is very valuable and we continue to focus on it but we got to focus on other things like whether or not you've got a good night's rest did you\nDid you save the information that I have ah been

going to impact like\nI think what's gonna happen is is that um will have to see because this wasn't really a policy change it was more of a letter that's changed is\nUm and really what it does is restate which is if you're a delete traveler you\nPaid a lot for your ticket you're going to get higher preferential treatment if something happens within the airline if if I'd entire airport closes it doesn't matter you're not getting out of town not on that airline or any other airline on that particular day it's about you know I Would say American Airlines has a mechanical problem on\nOne of its planes they can't fly for three or four or five hours people requesting to go on other airlines have had these agreements in place for decades where a legacy airlines\nOr a legacy airlines knocks a low cost carriers could actually move passengers form one airline to another as a courtesy when they have issues and especially when it happens\nInternationally which is going to be affected by these new rules but in this case they're going to have preferential treatment to their most elite and highest paying customers which may leave many coast passengers alerts about airlines do not want to leave passengers\nIn the lurch and pay for their hotel stays that would be actually be more expensive than that the actual airline tickets so this is going to be interesting to see how this rolls out I have a feeling we're going to have\nSeveral senators and maybe if you're running to the microphone the next couple of weeks right ahead of election time and saying well this is something that just won't be able to stand\nDown one I don't know what they were married in hopes to lead them to accomplish with this up in a few hotels overnight stays a second to break them\n[noise] um you know I don't think it has to be honest I think what you have is a bean counter at the airline\nAnd I and maybe they're not as busy that used to uh where did\nWhere does this charge come from and how do I cut that particular one I think this is just a general philosophical change over the last four or five years we've seen their loyalty programs\nGo from a mileage based programs or how much you pay for your tickets we've seen preferential treatment for those paying the most for the airline tickets and essentially the legacy airlines and and to some degree the low cost carriers are saying we're going to treat our best customers better than people that just hop from airline to airline looking for the cheapest price\n... well maybe that will pay off foreign but again it it could be bean counter thought as you pointed out Rick Seaney joining it take\nIt in the in the in the short run let's see how long it lasts\nRick Seaney fare compare in Tucson morning news thanks so much wrecked\n... like
