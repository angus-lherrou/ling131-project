world of children let's go to the adult world Jennifer Garner\nHas been speaking about a ... of alias the TV show that became her sort of signature entry into being a big time star\nOr she says that there is there something to it shows on from two thousand one or two thousand six\nVictor Garber who played her father on the show and pretty much plays or farther in real life\nOr the or it was a press\nEvent for her new show called camping on HBO\nShe said quote I heard that there is an alias ... happening but no one talked to me about it or comment marks a change for past remarks where she said she feels like a revival of the series is up to Jay Jay Abrams that's where he first got known to I think isn't it big time\nThough yeah right she said quote it would be totally different but if they didn't have me on as a gift that would be very very angry but I Can't imagine it being that seriously because they haven't heard anything about it from anybody is kind of like the discussion of the re boot again of twenty four and what goes on who's going to be in it\nWho is that what what what of what value would they showed me if it didn't have Jennifer Garner victory Garber it it it ... that's what people remember and its recent enough\nThere's only ten years ten twelve years ago that it would be um I Would be ... who you're going to put in there that\nYou know they keep rebooting stuff and they and for whatever reason it's very rare that and and I think it's a it's a mistake but there are some reason it's rare that they involve the original cast and I think that you know there there there's one great example on the cw the new the new version of the flash\n'em that can't that came back I don't know maybe five years ago six years ago something like that and they brought the original flash from the nineties\nHe's now the dad on the show of the of the young flash so they didn't the right way because they got the old fan who now are hooked on the new show and it kind of something for everybody and I think that's the smart way to do it when Dallas came back\nIt was the same thing that was brilliantly done I watched it with my mom I was too young to watch it when it was on the first time that my mom loved it so we're we watched it together and it was something we really liked but for some reason I don't know what the report of these shows they can Agnew into consideration that there was an older audience they're\nRight magnum PI I thought I wasn't going to like I've seen a couple of episodes on Monday nights and it uh it's okay that great but it's okay\nAnd how you guys All right Tom Selleck is so iconic\nRight he's not a time so it by any stretch of the imagination he doesn't have the caliber and there have to pay that kind of money for him he's okay here's a woman playing the role of Higgins who's a Brit who's a an interesting character on her own right but there's a lot of contrived\nCircumstances there are a lot of these shows are there's a lotta contrive ends in it\nAnd show seems to be somewhat contrived but it's it's ...\nIt's kinda like Hawaii Five o which is now lasted as a re route for nine years is I mean he's been around I\nDon't know anyone who's ever seen it but it seems to Seattle and\nI say it but the only reason I watch it actually as funny as it seems is because I Love the theme I watched the first four or five six minutes and then the theme comes on and I'll sit on the couch a move around\nBut to dot dot dot a started out on a\nShow just for the theme song yeah the theme song is right for anything thing about you do now as you can just watch that thing over and over again anytime you want [laughter]\nRing tone on your phone and then you don't need to wanna\nI was going to put this\n[laughter]
