around talking about this for a number of weeks now so let's get some tips and advice on teenage driving safe driving that sort of thing a welcome Sarah you've teenage a driver and your family\nNow now I don't but I Do a lot of that team driving instruction and came driving school for car control clinics so got a lot of connections and I feel responsible for every single one of them\nI'd fess up what was it like when you learn how to drive as a teenager\nYou know I was very fortunate dog and my parents put a great importance on situational awareness improper in car training and they sent me to one of the car control clinics early on when I had my learners permit so that I can\nLearn the the tactile driving skills but ultimately you know you don't even have to enact those skills as long as you're staying aware and being prepared that's why Michelin in a you know in our efforts\nThose skills as long as you're staying aware and being prepared that's why Michelin in a you know in our effort to try and reduce the number of teen deaths in automobile accidents because it's still even though the number goes down your over here it's still the number one killer of teens and until we get to zero that's not really acceptable\nEspecially when you consider most of it's preventable so you know as I said there are a lot of things we can do about driver training in in car but a lot of what we do\nHave this before we even start the engines so Michelin did a a recent survey and in seven major cities and discovered that forty percent of teens are driving an unsafe tires and probably in a lot of cases they didn't even realize it so\nWe wanted to start educating people on how simple it is to check your tires check your pressure check your tread debts\nAnd in order to do that uh you know we we just want to make these common connections and it's\nIt's not always fun to talk about tires me not everybody's a tire geek like me and\nMy I feel sorry and lit up when I tell people about\nThe dire geek are meant yeah what are you talking about when you go home at night to your husband or your general game I'd see I saw four tires were banned it got the people to change them I mean\nThat's really not too far from reality so yeah [laughter] but I mean the thing it's it's kind of like any any situation where you were all of a sudden you see something for the first time or you notice that for the first time then you start noticing it everywhere but I'm\nReally what we want to do with tires and and so what would Michelin did earlier this summer when when the kids were out of schools we launched this contest\nUh it was a street tread contest and they go on social media and show them taking care of their tires learning how to check their pressures or checking their tried that through the condition of their tires and what we did as a as a price for a hundred of of the winners was we partnered with bans the\nSneaker company um because you know it's not really easy to get people to care about or talk about their tires but it's really easy to get people to talk about their shoes and the kind of ironic part here is that tires or like the shoes for our cars and um I Wish you know I Know we're on radio so you can't see these awesome shoes\nBut they're uh you know vans created these with the Michelin Man designed into 'em and uh so the kids had the opportunity to make that equation to you know the performance of\nTheir car and the safety of their car their tires to I mean let's be honest you walk out on a\nSlippery day war tolls on your shoes your take on dive knows
