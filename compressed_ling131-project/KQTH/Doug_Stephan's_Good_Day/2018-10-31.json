active guys or it came out so organically and it's become this huge news story that now people are starting to panic about it but I Believe\nTheir antics rather agrees I'm just trying to be setting the table so why is Paul Ryan against it or is it just because he doesn't think the president is a riot against ending birthright citizenship or against the way the president's trying to get it done\nPaul Ryan's always been a little squishy on ... on immigration issues but he believes and this is it fair argument it's not like he's making something up or he's the Iraq thing out of line\nThe argument is that the president and have executive power to change immigration laws and I can remember not that long ago when Republicans what absolutely bananas because President Obama used an executive order to create DACA\nAnd that was the program to keep children of immigrants in the country which is known\nSort of it will walk but not right and so Republicans said you don't have the right to do that so there needs to be a real look at at not necessarily whether you can write an executive order on this but when the legal challenges come to the world will stand up all the way to the Supreme Court\nDoes the introduction of the legislation by Graham Senator Graham ah and to this is the lives vision is aimed at ending birthright citizenship is that fix the problem with Ryan's

actually have a step forward with that because\nYou're still going to have a lot of gridlock no matter who controls the house in the Senate there is going to be it's not going to be a blowout for

necessarily go anywhere but that's\nWhen I was on what grounds do you fight this kind of an outrage ... I don't even begin to understand how these people think how do you come up with an intelligence strategy or an intelligent reason or an intelligent answer\nTo this problem is is something that it would seem to me anybody's got any comment says why do you want all these people coming here\nAnd taking advantage of what you pay in taxes for ... well we don't know what they're going to grow up to ... so it will be born in their own country and they have something to offer we look at them when they should be able to come in not just willy nilly everybody gives is is nuts weird ... some people are just crazy in this country already\nStars that I'm just curious because you know a lot of people think that that's written into the constitution and so does that give us the ability to look at other parts of the constitution and interpret them differently\nWell that's ... that's where the court is there for is to interpret the constitution requires right they're saying in the United states or convention and you know I don't believe that I actually got on the constitution but I think you know and\nAnd it was right there saying what are we in the United states or convention and you know I don't believe that I actually got on the constitution but I Know and there's always been okay I'll just finished my sentence and the way it is you're right\nThere's always been a debate about what the meaning of jurisdiction is when it was originally written into the constitution by\nAh by the creators of the constitution so that that's what they are going to go after it's not about necessarily a constitutional amendment it's going to be about trying to figure out in tents and using examples throughout history of how that intent was supposed to play\nOut though who does the interpreting here does Trump is negative order and then it goes to the Supreme Court and the other side whether it stands up or not or didn't know frame court interpret it and then Trump can make his executive order they\nNeither one actually what would happen is if he does write an executive order the executive order would go into effect and then no doubt somebody on the other side would it take it to court and legally challenges much like a travel ban\nAnd so then it would be sold and it would go through the lower court and no doubt be probably pushed all the way up to the Supreme Court where the ultimate decision would be made about intent at the clock to do with it\nFell and effect I'm just curious about all of this as a fill in effect as it goes up to the Supreme Court if that happens or they don't\nTypically the travel ban they like the travel ban blades on\nThat until there wasn't quite make the decision okay\nAll right so that means you know just be retroactive would this be like every baby ever that was born here or would it be starting hardening run Iraq yeah\nIt's hard to regular director but it should be in place and with regard to the constitution just to sort of what I was saying not necessarily getting my election I just think there are a lot of things to be reviewed from time to time we have a lot of things that carefully battered\nFeeling you start doing that though the protections that we all love they go away so you got to be careful when you start making\nBut I think that there's too many uh infringed feelings on both sides are it's but it's hard to know what the right thing to do is you're right about that happy Halloween everybody how do you do a lot of which has created broomsticks for\n... in Oregon to get into the Halloween spirits\nAre they paddle six\nMiles on voids along the ...

it's a perennial a good idea I'm basically the idea would be you know you take a look at regions right fairly by the states they get up\nYou know border region or no counties and in Arizona I'm where there aren't a lot of insurers are a lot of Obamacare insurers and basically say well let's create a region of\nYou know maybe there's only one insurer here and and one insurer and the county right over the line um all of a sudden there's two insurers right and you expand that no\n... you know I think the way to do it would be to to take that sort of approach create you sort of regional zone

jobs that are very quickly you know the Democrats decided that the only way to provide affordable health care is through the ... the Republican started making some pretty big promises that\nYou know it turned out they couldn't keep I don't think it's because they don't want to but I think because they realize that\nYou know ten years down the line their constituents are actually you know some of those that if it from the Affordable CARE Act and you got to pay a but it's hard for them to defend or or push through a full throated repeal ah\nWell not the case but fortunately in the past couple of months yeah in some good but I'll distraught and all these things really quickly the first is that the Trump Administration are extended\nA short term insurance plans which are really great option for a for people to get affordable plans would suit their needs these plans are collapsed anywhere from a year to three years and they're not subject to any of the uh Affordable Care act mandates that
