I'm a lawyer devout\nTypes I ... I had women teachers a male teacher I had more women teachers probably than I did male teachers but I had some great\nMen teachers that I still love so much and I still keep in touch with it keep in touch with that ... that it's all about for me someone who just talk to kids like a person I I think when teachers tried to um\nTo teach above the heads of their students that's when I think they lost a lot of people I loved it when a teacher could make something relevant with something that was either going on in our lives in our school\nThat's when I think they lost a lot of people I loved it when a teacher could make something relevant with something that was either going on in our lives in our school maybe something we had heard about the news when teachers made things relevant and told us why they were important those are always the one\nShow died and I kind of skin totally not religion a sort of carry what about you\nYeah I'm trying to think back and I feel like a kind of agreeing with Jen that my favorite teachers in classes now there first of all based on the subject though I Would probably never going to like a teacher if it was a subject that I really dislike there wasn't a way that I think teachers can always do\nA better job at getting kids invested in those subjects that they're not interested in but they're never going to be my favorite teachers and the future as I did really love really went above and beyond to train relate to the students and make things exciting and make them\nUnderstand it and make it make them want to be involved in it in a way that was just beyond like oh well that's the history of the I don't know European kings and stuff like that like\nThey have to make it personal to you and I I'm sure that there's way more to this when it comes to what didn't do well in what students do bad what district it then how much money the kids have at home with their parents are at home reading with them so I think it's much more complex issue\nI think the teacher thing is interesting but I I think it's important that we just encourage more and more people to go into teaching because I think we're kind of at a place where\nThere's not a lot of money to be offered that it's a lot of hours you're working with people and kids who are not necessarily in great places and don't necessarily respect you so I think a lot of people aren't going into teaching and I think we need to figure out a way to get more and more people into teaching\nI think that's the solution\nObservation yard but back to you and your days in school to whom did you\nWell that's what I'm saying is it's not really I I don't have a specific you don't if you're going out like only white women I mean one of my ... was your name or class or a year ... one of my favorite teachers\nWith my sign language teacher she was a white woman but it was the very immersive experience so we were not allowed to talk at all in that class we were only doing sign language and I feel like I learned some of the most important like I I learned so much in that class and I ...\nUm well I thought it was interesting my one of my older sisters had taken the class a few times and she minored in depth study it when she was in college and so\nYou know me being the youngest sister I'm always kind of interested in what my older sister did and I took it and it was so fun I'm much more of a visual learner and I learned by doing things and so\nI've taken friends for years I was never super great at it because we just kind of went through a vocabulary list and that was not fun to me but when you're in a class and you're using your hands and you're communicating that way that was\nReally fun and I thought the teacher taught it and a great way she was a white woman I don't know if that influence it at all I think it was her personality and the way she chose to teach it\nBut then I had a lot of male teachers for English and history and math and I really liked them as well so I I don't really see it as a a gender divide unfortunately a lot of my teachers were white I didn't have a lot of teachers who weren't white so I Can't really speak\nOn that even in college students and professors are usually a much more diverse group\nYeah I'm trying to earn their way or maybe I just didn't really love any of my college classes that my [laughter] 'cause none of them are really coming to mind my favorite team or were so high school and\nI'm thinking about as you said that my favorite I had three or four process in college that I really liked and we're friends with when I was there and and one of them I didn't remember to keep up with because he was\nCollege that I really liked and we're friends with when I was there and and one of them I didn't wasn't able to keep up with because he was killed I he was in Iraqi named movie dean hot war and he taught a political science at every course that he offered a he was a\nMess [laughter] moslem guy came discovery went to northwestern get a doctorate there ended up in Heidelberg in the middle of nowhere in Ohio married to a Southern Baptist\nIt while most interesting I was just amazing and he went back to fight against Saddam Hussein and was killed\nA but he was his family he came from the era before ... Hussein or the era of hum of kings and queens in princes and and he was the son of a prince\nAnd and then that's how he was able to get out of Iraq and go to northwestern to get an education\nAnd he just said here and then this country became such a mess he went back to try to ah work under if you will under the guise of or some other you know the ... he went back to teach so he said but he didn't really go back to teach he went back to try to disrupt\nWhat Saddam was doing and he was not successful but that's a name and their face and an experience\nI never met a moslem before in my life for God's sakes I'm from Framingham, Massachusetts the moslem within a hundred miles of here when I was a kid growing up plenty him around\nNow but then no and I didn't even pay any attention because I've never been much that ... and it was [laughter]\nTo school and I went to was supposedly\nBased on Christian tradition\nA and was affiliated with the United church of Christ\nAnd yet here's this Muslim guy who shows up a who that people find fat of the girls loved him and he had no idea that that was what he had no sense of anything except his job\nAnd his country he paid no attention to his wife had a couple of kids who are running around all over the place but he understood because we grew up in a family of forty\nForty siblings 'cause his father had eight wives and yeah [laughter]\nAnd so that we learning of that stuff is fascinating how that all happened but I\nI think there is something to you know the more exposure to have the different people in different thinking they healthier your mind is going to be that's the way I look at it so trail same ... just breeds and it's like inbreeding yeah you never you're you're you're having a baby with your sister or something is that\nKind of crazy is not not productive as I said I Know it was a ...

cake you da\n\nAnd I love to hear from your right here\nHave to jump back that you're taking the game this weekend to catch them from four to seven I Want to take you G H\nI probably I read a biography there's a\nBunch of interesting ones out there Henry Ford Thomas at us and I'm Charlie Parker Stormy Daniels yeah Stormy Daniels\nGot that memoir coming our way and those who are interested or be advised it's going to be released today it deals with presidential trust in a variety of other issues ABC's Dave Schreiber has the details\nVoid those if you can at least on one of those days on Thursday morning is the best time to go and even if you're flights are only three or four hours in duration\nYou can still get there for for um family food to football on Sunday or right there around lunchtime so it's pretty good time to fly as well mhm I'm so ultimately if you're trying to do the logistics on\nWhose house should we have just which we do in our\nFamily in many cases um it it's usually want it to be wherever there's a bigger city so if somebody is coming in from a big city or\nGoing into a big city does tend to be a wildly cheaper prices ban 'em for you know other cities where you know regional cities and not put Tucson in that category no if you're going if you're heading to Tucson to somewhere where somewhere to Tucson you're probably better off having to a bigger city\nOkay All right well the again the idea is to get on your horse right now and get a deal you know before they're all gone uh the closer you get and again you point out the traveling on Thanksgiving itself became work that and that's a great deal [noise] [noise]\nYeah no it's actually kind of fun I've flown on Thanksgiving morning as several times and you would think that everybody who doesn't like to work on Thanksgiving but they're getting triple time\nOn All right they're actually they're actually quite sphere [laughter] so uh and you have some in the middle seats on planes too which is a luxury we don't have very often while I just got back from Paris last night and there weren't a whole lot of empty middle seat on the plane\nOkay well let's get a little wonky here and talk a seat pitch\n'em spare fight going on right now about getting people laugh airplane safely and comfort and that kind of thing um I guess they got spirit Arab or frontier airlines among the industry's tightest they got about twenty eight inches did seat patch as I understand it as the distance one seat back to the next um\nHow was he was a measure of the room essentially leave room is is where\nOr price sensitive with those things but generally the other argument is you know if we do have to evacuate this plane and the seats are so close together already preventing people from exiting the plane quick enough right uh and and so you know you have\nA lot of arguments being made by policymakers I I've seen lots of people in the house and the Senate make those complaints saying those kind of airlines the rules or um\nOr state they have sort of minimum rules but even the airlines are close to those from a safety perspective and in order to test that kind of stuff that can take years to actually do those kind of test\nSo even if they wanted to test what's the difference between twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one seat pitch and how you exit planes um it\nWould take years to do those kind of test some trials so\nI I don't it's not overly feasible but it's a it's a pretty good argument if you want to set the rules and say the minimum is twenty eight or twenty nine and have the spirits and frontiers in the world you have to adhere to that and they'll have to do that and change their business model\nWow All right well I just want story
