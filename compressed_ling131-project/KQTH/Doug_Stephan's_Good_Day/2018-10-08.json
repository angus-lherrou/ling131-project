complain about the past\nYou can progress Nate you could talk about it you can do many things in fact or you can just plain do it the faster you do it however the faster you'll get it done you see when it comes to a central time management there is no fancy advice just plain practical wisdom just do it\nAnd do what you have to do do what's most important first just get it done because of the end of the day just as there is no such thing as half\nYou're either dead or alive there's also no such thing as a task half done if you have something to do with these are done or it's not done and

inspiration to help you to ensure stuff\nOut of your budget Boston would\nTo make it sound like the world is coming to an end is pretty damned irresponsible what is responsible is that people are

recovered expect to be saved and those people are just to leave him\nThere and that's why I'm ordering people try and make it sound like the end of the world every single time because somehow after all the time people still don't don't aren't paying for it and that's what I don't understand people who live in these areas and they still every year act surprised that you know they are gay\nWow this is the thirteenth named tropical storm of the season and the season lasts they're probably maybe a chance or over the next two or three weeks that there would be another one that were developed by the time we get to the end of October pretty much go put ski let's go backwards shall we ladies\nOr the Senate passed one point seven billion dollar disaster aid package\nFor the states that were ... by the last Hurricane Florence last year not remember than what it did to Carolina this storm that ... is going to dub tons more water\nOn those states that got tons of water in Hurricane Florence so that's where the real danger is uh and so it but it\nSort of tied together with this um\nThe ah we talked about this little bit but I don't think we I think we gave it short shrift\nThis bill was passed late friday\nOr was overwhelmingly by the way pass by the Senate for two reasons one disaster aid helping people to keeping the Federal Aviation administration running and included in that is the passenger bill of rights\nGiving the department of justice and homeland security the authority to track drones they may be a credible threat also how the airlines run their business how the airlines act\nWhen it comes to things like over booking practical things that have affected probably all of us who fly the bills specifically says airlines cannot force passengers off the plane\nThey must compensate passengers or kicked off and over ... plane so I'm trying to figure this out the bill says airlines can't force you off\nAnd then it says you must be compensated if you're kicked off [laughter] so are we really clarification on that one\nThat I mean if you're booted from your flight before you get on it\nOh once you out on a plane they can't pay you off ... that makes sense thank you\nI don't think that's a law in New York City once you're in a taxi cab by law they're not allowed to kick you out why would you get\nIn and then you ... ... that's why you always get in and close the door before you tell the guy where you want to go to guy has a lot of them can if you go and I don't want to go to Brooklyn or no I don't want to go there and then they eat on New York or any of that I mean look at that\nHow many people that I you know I never knew that it happening every day to tourists they open the door and they go can I go to JFK and the guy speeds off [laughter] I don't want it they don't want to go to certain places but if you get in and you close the door to the law they have to go where you tell them to\nThank you I was in your area and I thought everybody knew that but I can now I don't know that I don't know if I didn't like that and that's I don't remember that now next time I think I gather in New York doping nightmare hit in in order them around and then clothes that are yeah All right today\nIs the most wasted inefficient use of time day in the Syrian sixty five days and we have every year\nUm I usually boycott even talking about Columbus Day because he was such a no good bastard a was a waste of time this is a whiz day is a waste of time and so and the fact that we don't have people in school on this day to teach what really Columbus was about is even more offensive\nNot if they're in school today I Am not around here\nThey are no they're not and that's good is that something new I didn't think they 'cause when I was\nI never had a people honoring any last day\nThat they shouldn't even no good useless piece of you know what so what do I really\nLike is it a banquet holiday today it is like that I call it up to the banks and post office banks I posed\nOut as well get an email today all in honor of is no good SOB now\nAnd when do we get you know this is the kind of stuff that people say why don't the why didn't the legislative process take hold here all the most of the people you'd think someone in a in Congress would introduce a bill to knock this day are\nI'm sure they have I think that's already happening but knowing why does it not get knocked off because who wants to take away a federal holiday when they are fine wonderful\nBut less production\nUnveiling ago All right let's get to our a TV report Joey uh Jennifer I

I don't think all that water has receded yet has it no good on the floor and they will at some of it will have but some yeah\nNot a pretty picture so it brings around to a new report issued by an inter governmental panel on climate change at the un warning that the world is rapidly running out of time to scale back greenhouse gas emissions\nThis document says global warming has to be kept within one and a half degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels to stave off planetary changes that could be catastrophic\nAnd to do that fossil fuels have to be phased out to meet net zero emissions by mid century or more immediately emissions have to drop by forty five percent below twenty ten levels\nOr by the year twenty thirty I this is this kind of stuff is very speculative as far as I'm concerned one thing I Do know is that we are creating with a fossil fuel\nA situation that isn't ... quote unquote natural I was reading something in a uh I don't go to the un has come see ... as far as I'm concerned but there was a there's a great article in the current issue of a National Geographic that pretty much ... outlines what's going on and some of the major cities in the world\nAnd how they're coping with is you know you hear these stories and then you throw your\nMy God and that makes me done well nothing is further from the truth 'cause a lot is being done\nAnd some of it may have impact significant summer may not but to think or to say that nothing is being done is nonsense because there's a lot being in some cases some of his little puff or a\nA but in in five or six if you see the new National Geographic there's five or six cities including Los Angeles some Asian cities some um southern American cities it's interesting because I never focus on the middle east when it comes to this because the middle east is such a disaster [laughter]\nWhen it comes to any of this stuff nobody pays any attention to it\nBecause it's it's a mess everything's a mess\nSo but there are a couple of Asian cities that are impacted Hong Kong I think is one of them is one in Malaysia that they highlight and what's being done\nAre in this in in\nAnd not to the extent we've done a lot in this country I can always do more but it's it's instructive European focus on this has been very serious and one of the things I remember when I first started going to England in the Nineteen seventies you would go into some of the older\nThe the really beautiful English towns and the buildings would be black\nAnd I never really thought about it much the buildings were black and then you go back and you see the buildings cleaned up and I remember asking having a conversation with my friends in London and how it goes back to when the only source of fuel in England was cold\nAnd after the war or even before the war when they back in the Nineteen thirties when they knew they were going to go they were going to have a problem with Hitler they focused all of their\nUh attention on on the war machines and building stuff and so everything sort of stayed the same\nAnd the cheapest fuel because all of the the more modern fuels will be used in the war effort so coal is burned everywhere and it was off coal and the soft Kohl leaves a really obvious uh I suppose you could call a contaminant on the side of buildings that black\nThat there is from coal dust from the cold going in the air so imagine what people who walked around in the city of London or any of these other places what it did to their lungs that's the beginning of black lung disease\nThe population the people who worked in the coal mines wherever they were coal mines for the hundred or a hundred and fifty years before this all were dying of black lung disease but it became more a ... a a a circumstance or a problem in the general population because\nIt was being burned everywhere so people were breathing it\nIn their normal course of their their days\nAnd so that black stuff on the buildings got into your lungs\nBad news man but that stuff is really been cleaned up so anyway do we get to this point do we think about ... all of the national international focus on it really has to come back to you\nYou got to decide whether you want to drive an electric car a car that's a hybrid or do things at your house like I'm building a new barn facility next year at the farm and it's going to be completely a solar powered\nA and I go to a four and a half acre I'm going to put it on top of the building and I'm going to build I'm going to have a on the side of a hill a little a solar farm\nTo power everything on the farm not this just as new building so\nThat kind of stuff and more people around where I Am anyway a friend of mine I just work did some work helping him at his house and he's putting up a solar on his roof of his garage so we can power is out and buy another guy that I Know is putting it in a because he wants to sell back the power\nTo the power company and that's a good plan to but there are a lot of really good wind is fabulous I was thinking of running a windmill at the farm and generating but we're on the side of a hill and there's not going to let him be a lot of wind is oh probably a waste of time\nBut there are lots of things you can do think about it yourself in terms of your own home that's where you start what should drive higher power your home that's the sort of thing it means something to tell us about you know one and a half degrees Celsius and global warming and all that crap that doesn't mean anything to anybody\nBut when you get right down to the nitty gritty what you can do than and if there is a financial incentive which there is\nA when it comes to solar and that sort of thing as a financial real financial incentive as well as an atmospheric incentive for doing it so I'm just telling you what I'm\nYes I'm doing I'm big as are the ladies on Texas super food Texas super food what a great name isn't it\nThink about it for a minute what would Texas it's the big state of Texas what could be bigger than Texas super food do you know that they've created a blend of the best organic vine ripe and fruits and vegetables
