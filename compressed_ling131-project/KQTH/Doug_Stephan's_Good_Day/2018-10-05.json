word she wrote and dash word but fill out of context and not letting anyone know where the source material of that is which is John Lennon in this case\nThat was a huge mistake but what other part of what she said is true that is just an historically factual statement those things have happened to women since the beginning of time\nSo I don't know that if I don't I don't agree with you that I wouldn't put her in the category of joy ... by Barbra Streisand I don't really get to\nConnect to learn about through okay and I don't like the next show there but I just explained it to their angry Jewish woman\nAnd I I don't I don't know if the tweet with necessarily it didn't feel I mean an angry yes but it's not her just like being unfounded yeah and this and I I I think she was\nOn ... the long run around and it seems like you're dismissing her because she ... maybe ... or a over that's not what I'm doing\nAnd that you're not a real live of how is it unfair when I'm trying to that's how your words are being interpreted you know she's an angry Jewish woman I think he already much everybody heard your your statement very angry Jewish women yeah I was at it but in any other way so that is what I think they're right and that's what I'm saying it is what you said\nThere's a little bit of I mean just to\nTo try to figure it all out I mean I think with Bette Midler it's unusual to hear her go this way because we don't hear her getting crazy with the ... you're on Twitter we hear that from the joy they are in Barbara Streisand who not for their religious beliefs are who they are culturally I Would link them together but because\nThey are loud outspoken\nA left leaning\nAmerican women and so I think to put Bette Midler into that crowd is unusual and that's probably why she's trending because I don't think she would make\nThose statements would I Would tell you it's probably more the story here is that when celebrities have a couple of glasses of wine they should not be allowed to tweak we've seen this happen with Roseanne and careers are ended we've seen now maybe that's happened with Bette\nMidler I doubt her career will be ended because her messages on the right side of the Iowa which makes it more acceptable even if she uses despicable language so\nDon't know I don't think anybody's hiring anywhere it's hard to draw correlations you know we we are burying the lead here the reason that she got backlash is because she has the language\nYeah it is not because of the message if she had just taken that sentence out and just talked about the other stuff she mentioned everyone would have been re tweeting this in a good way\nBy the fact that you know that it's any it's and this is on the left to know no one on the left as tolerating anybody using the N. word especially if you're white\nSo glad thing we need to back away from probably the the wind or whatever like makes us think he was kind of cool and it's like right wing ...\nRight and I said we totally miss fire and that those kinds of things these days are enough to bring someone down because if you look at the wrong word in the wrong language which clearly this is the wrong language to be using right now or anytime you're in trouble\nRight and she's trying to be like you know too smart for the room and not giving ... of this is John Lennon song from Nineteen Seventy two I have that album that's the only reason I even knew that when I read that it was like oh she's coating John Lennon everyone else seems to know that and as soon as you're dining room I went and I would have no clue if I start writing like writing and most don't know that right\nUnless they do now seems to know that and that's an Israeli thing um I went and I would have no clarify side right like right and most don't know that right now\nInteresting phrase too smart for the room at ... that is what I think of Jimmy Kimmel I think Jimmy Kimmel is always trying to impress everybody he's the type of person that I bring that in only because doesn't refer necessarily although he may be on board with the thinking of these three women we're talking about but\nI find that phrase to be interesting and I was just looking at something that he said and how he's been called out he he gets\nHe thinks he's that it sets them as snarky yeah mugs ... on the smartest guy in the room kind of stuff\nAnd I think joy bay Har presents that I don't know that I feel that way but Barbara Streisand although I don't agree with anything that she says politically I just find or a ... more\nI may agree with or actually politically and some stuff it just bothers me and and maybe the nuance of what I'm saying didn't come across Victoria\nI don't like it when people have that stride and I'm the smartest guy in the room and you need to believe me otherwise you're a moron I don't I don't that doesn't I don't find that attractive er appealing of dust I shut that off or turn it out or go away\nOr from the conversation that's basically why I put those are specially joy they are about whom uh when I first met her I had a great admiration for her that she was funny I thought she but she just turned into this angry angry angry woman\nAnd there's nothing that you see or hear from her does anything other than than the horror show the right as a horror show\nThe raise any more of our show than the left depending on where you're coming from but it's that kind of stuff and we've created it seems are allowed to be created this uh this whole sense of\nI'm smarter than you are I'm right you're wrong you don't believe me than you know screw you that kinda stuff never fixes anything and that's a lot of what when and I go back to the law of attraction that is one of the reasons that things are is messed up as they are because we keep holding on to this um right you're wrong\nIt isn't the case that you are right and I'm wrong all the time sometimes I'm right sometimes I'm wrong sometimes you're right sometimes you're wrong and I'm not even to be about that it ought to be about OK what can we agree upon where do you see that in any of these conversation\nI think I don't have to find their point on it what I think you're trying to say is when people have when people state claimed instead of introducing a conversation about important stuff I think\nThat you personally see that as a turn off there are a lot of people who like to consume media yeah I Know people who know exactly what\nThey're saying they want to stay in their stride and that's why they have people follow them but I think you are more like not stay you're more like a woman but I think females can see them but there are a lot of people I heard all females no matter if they agree with the person or not that have a hard time dealing with listening to people who are very strident on the radio and so I think\nWe want to you're inclined to want to have\nA conversation more than someone who just as well that's that's how it is a ... and that that well that would make sense to me\nIt was a nice guy tried to cover that try to get it out OK [laughter]\nThank you but ... but\nWe used to have that sometimes it is today we celebrate world

D. program [noise]\nHi I'm Warren expert with the pet show tip of the day you know it's well documented that music therapy can provide a welcome distraction your pleasure for people especially those hospitalized with cancer or coping with terminal diseases\nMusic and minimize pain decrease anxiety and service a powerful distraction for patients this theme seems to hold true for our pets\nRecently a a professional concert violinist talked about something called harp therapy and studies with down at the University of California in San Diego they tested the effects of ... music on wolves dogs cats goats sheep stuck his guerillas\nAnd other species of animals and what they found is absolutely amazing even the paid veterinarians and tested discovered\nThat animals when listening to music will calm down you know we've always heard the old saying that music calm the Savage beast well absolutely that same is true so you have a dog a little excited our cat it's a little upbeat try playing some good car music for that might help them out but I Know what's going to make you feel better at the same time I'm Warren ...\nLosing weight is one of the best feelings in the world what's even better is when people notice most people who take couch and say they sleep better at West joint pain and more energy throughout the day it's all natural so it doesn't interfere with any of your medications and it has an eighty six percent success rate with weight loss just take it at night right before you go to bed it's that easy ... science\nAnd you can add it to coffee can put it over ice cream it's it's something even I think you would like that but it's made from a fruit that the elephant in ah like in South Africa love and they wait because it's so hot and all of this or that ah\nYou know all the heat goes into into the ... and then it falls off the vine et falls off the tree and the elephant eat it and they can't even stand up they actually like to [laughter]\nJust [laughter] and it's so cute it's so cute to watch but the alcohol that they make from it is it's a really good so is that what happens to people when they drink that's\nSimilar to ... all over like elephant yeah let on your side\nSo I'm just sort of in that same department for a moment how many have you seen the picture of the elephant crushing the a lion who was a ... a mother elephant had her a elephant calf with her and the capital's being attacked\nBy a I'm a buy a lion and the mother knock the line over in stepped on it\nGood for you miss elephant\nVery interesting to see how that the protective how it works because there are a big elephant in going to be afraid of nor is it going to be attacked by a a a you know a line or a tiger or anything like that 'cause it's too small\nUm but in the case of the cub or the they call them cabs element tabs that is not the case and so the ah the the system as it works in Africa or wherever they are as the survival of the fittest and picking on a little elephant\nCub will elephant calf is something that lions and tigers do all the time\nAnd in this case uh the uh the lion didn't survive didn't make it\n... this is just mother made by their nature and um all of the pluses and minuses of realizing what life is all about really that survival is all about we have is maybe we're not much different than they are the animal kingdom\nIf it was all about really that survival is all about you know maybe we're not much different than they are the animal kingdom is focused on survival are we not like his round survive always\nHear the stories of moms are able to lift cars up or do other crazy stuff when they're in danger so I think don't mess with a mom when it comes to their kid I mean I always hear that many see their cab and they're adorable but if their mom is anywhere near the donor and that's\nAround ... well that's true for elephants too into that you don't mess with relevance if their cabs are around so there is a word to the wise as we move on people in the news of next year on the D.

challenge the candidates on their record her position [noise] I didn't realize I was to ask a simple question and let the gentleman go at each other I offer my sincere apologies to the people of Pennsylvania state I truly love\nOr he kicked off the event where they monologue telling the audience that he was not drunk when he accepted the invitation to moderate the debate\nAbout whether or not he should have done it was the question later on what on earth was I thinking and that a couple of laughs came out of that but the fact that he put himself in that position and then the criticism that has come for some of the things that he said that\nYou know one way or another they don't seem to be life shaking a but it's that would you expect from him and so that's a but his whole reputation has been Gerard and that's the point I'm making year by his appearance at this political event\nAnd whether that was you know ... not a huge deal as been blowing up into a huge deal yeah and now are acting his life and yeah and his personality forever\nYeah but anyway uh\nThat's uh an aside so meanwhile back in the ranch or the other the the the Facebook hacking how many people have worried Victoria cue and you're good at this stuff from Victoria joins I'd like to have you jumping on this as well as Facebook what was it fifty million\nPeople accounts were compromised yet again ah what in the name of God is going on there\nAnd why is with all of these questions I Know the numbers have gone down on Facebook but they don't seem to be going down appreciably and one wonders why because they seem to be very well have just if they got to shore of themselves what is going on there\nWell as in terms of numbers one of the reasons why Facebook's numbers have they've definitely dropped off but in the older demographic they have not because that's\nFor two reasons one older people don't know how to disconnect and delete an account on Facebook and that's actually I'm not making a joke that is a very real thing\nAnd the second thing is for a lot of older people that is still their lifeline of communication with family across the country or around the world and so those numbers of the older generation are always going to be there on Facebook\nBut for a lot of younger people they've just you know pulled the plug\nAnd and you just keep hearing these stories time and time again that they've been hacked and security isn't good\nAnd you know and again going back to the older generation using Facebook they're probably still using password one so they're even more vulnerable and they don't even realize that\nThey don't change their passwords they never change it right you have to change your passwords\nOn a regular basis I you know get my mom to try to she's not even on Facebook but if she was\nTo get her to change your password you know it's all I've got a sheet we're right on my password right out and you know it's just it's never going to happen so unfortunately there are a lot of people who are very very vulnerable to all kinds of now where and you know all kinds of stuff\nGoing to be that and we live with forever yeah and it just it is it's got to be something that we have to learn how to deal with the way you deal with it is you change your password and your right your user name uh\nYeah and it just it is it's got to be something that we have to learn how to deal with the way you deal with it is you change your password and your right your user name or at least a couple of times a year yeah\nCan I can I also said something very creepy I'm about Facebook which is that they've asked people to use to fact to identification and I'm In\nAn American id number and your finger some representing the log in on the computer and then you get attached to your phone yeah and you and then you say yes this is me on your phone and not computer says okay you can get in so is that good or bad return it it's good\nWell in theory in theory it's good but\nWhat Facebook has done is that uh they have been ousted and court for settling the phone number is ... ... well being used for two facts to identification in other words to make people feel more secure to advertise it\nYeah there are a bunch of the that they were really really really made that has to be able to get to ...\nThat right I I mean I I I'm Still on Facebook because I like to see occasionally will my nephews that do it I don't use Facebook anymore I I Am so Don ... with ... but I got done with him when he announced a few years ago\nOh well you'll stream it's no longer

listening who knows who they are uh is really silly but there's one thing that I Want to mention before we pause\nHere and that has to do with where the Facebook and other social media come into our society come into our lives\nThe story this week of a third grader who brought a loaded hand gun\nInto a an elementary school because he wanted to scare the children who are picking on him and where that went in terms of social media\nInstead of curtailing it\nControlling it he goes out for everybody to see and in my mind this gives other people the idea to get a hold of a hand gun\nTo do the same thing I think that's what social media does it spreads bad ideas and there's no shifting there's some good ideas and loving things that are there and I promote and I put up on my personal page but there are a lot of\nThe eggs in there at all angry at that age is ... television news ah everything does that spreads ideas now good and bad\nForty six past the hour we're going to help
