J. B. show [noise] [noise]\nHi I'm Warren ... with the pet show tip of the day you know\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with telling your dog no once in awhile\nExcept that doesn't give them enough information what are you telling him no for I often joke when I Walk into some homes and say the word no the dog comes thinking actor's name instead of telling your dog no no all the time tell him what you want him to do dogs don't generalize well so if your dog jumps up on someone to say hello and you say no he\nMay jump higher I may jump to the left side and said the right it's really important that you understand this concept okay when you're working with your dog\nDon't focus on the negative because if you do you'll get a dog that may reacting negative what you want to do is focus on the positive so for example if you do have that dog the jumping all over people rather than saying no no no bad dog would I suggest you do is take the leash and Colorado at that point I'm assuming you've done some basic training with your dog\nAnd used up positive reinforcement you learned early on to control the situation it's never no no no occasionally yes and basic training will make all the different um our next time\nDoug seven here for purity products namely the krill omega fifty plus with co Q. ten\nI've noticed that I bet you have noticed decreased mobility as you get a little older things began to wane so I've started taking krill omega fifty plus with co Q. ten from surety what a difference my energy is back\nIt's like all the votes you\nAre you going to be a goldfish does that offend goldfish because they have memory problems I mean there but I I understand the historical significance in contact a black face and it is not a pretty time in our culture it's not anything that we should celebrate\nBut if someone on the real housewives of New York who likes Diana Ross is admiring Diana Ross not goofing on Diana Ross and like there's so much she wants to look like or is that an insult was I wrong with that I think and I think Megan Kelly was kind of going in that direction\nAnd people absolutely smack down even lost her agent ca her her uh agent or agency dropped her she had to sit there and look like a ding dong on television crying to apologize about it and we just we need to take a step back and if someone said something stupid do the right thing and use it as a teachable moment in\nUnder ... given forgive little novella\nYeah anything that you can dress up just kind of the other perspective I think that you can dress up in a costume but I think it's the adding the racial part like you can dress up like Diana Ross with the hair and dress and that and that's kind of part of the costume but I think adding\nThe skin color is what makes it offensive to people because your skin is not a costume it's it's kind of the clothes that you wear on top so it's like if you're a Geisha girl and then you paint your skin to look more Asian or you pay your skin to look dark or like a native\nUm it's it's kind of the clothes that you wear on top so it's like if you're a Geisha girl and then you paint your skin to look more Asian or you paint your skin to look dark or like a Native American that's am I making sense that's not part of the\nWire that offended by that or why would somebody who had a yellow skin tone be offended by someone who wanted\nTo ... their faith of white and what are the only ... the like the white powder kind of like yeah you know the cake white powder that they were part of that\nCost him but I don't know to be offensive and why do people take it as often I think that\nPeople don't like their skin color to be used as a costume I don't know how to I'm trying to figure out the best way to explain I I think it's just that the costs to me part of it that seems offensive even if you don't mean even if you admire Diana Ross I think it's that thing okay you're a black person and and making that part of the costume and\nAnd because it's not because it's someone's real life and it's something that they have to deal with real life issues about I don't I don't know but I also think\nI Wish that was better at explaining this because\nIn my ... and you're saying it's like a costume and I understand that I I guess it just I just don't see it it's more of a big deal not to do that because this is the truth is is that my skin is whitish and that ...\nAnd if you're wanting to look like her is it more of a ... I don't know is\nIt does turn it around in a U.S we don't All right let's say there's a\nBlack person who likes ah Jennifer and wants to dress up as Jennifer for Halloween and puts white chalk all over his or her face is that offensive view Jennifer would you be offended by that\nI think of it sure looked bizarre looking white chick that was what the whole movie was about was Damon Wayans and ah\nWhich I'm a ... who is the brother Damon at whatever but they did the whole movie and white face because they want it to be white girls light checks making fun of like well I don't know it's\nA hard line to walk but I don't think that we will ever move past all of the terrible things that happened in our history I think\nThe question about that for a while he was every time somebody does something\nRepresent all of the horrors of the past if somebody does something like that does that represent all of the horrors of the best I think that's\nI don't know I think it was kind of the way that she said it I didn't watch the whole interview it was one of those things and and maybe you can say Jennifer ... if you did watch it if she had said or one when I was a kid blackface was okay and I think that\nKind of the day and all that that is what people take issue with the whole idea of all when I was a kid it was okay most of the time it wasn't actually okay with anyone else it's just okay with was one yeah the ... you know like people have done terrible things for a long time and you know people thought it was okay but it didn't actually mean it was okay\nYou know what I mean it was so ... that in some states didn't last week we talked with some state that\nJust approved ... station that makes lynching black people the illegal\nThey were talking about the just lay out some fate and like I Can't remember which one of the water but\nOkay\nForty three past the hour good conversation beg you ladies on the D.

chime in America were crazy allegations can be made against men and women\nThat doesn't even matter if they can be proved the person who's named as politically and professionally dead\nAnd it's the

eighties but he listens to me now\nAnd he heard me talking about Neil Armstrong and the movie first man which I went to see last weekend and I talked about it on Monday and I said I didn't like it it wasn't comforting because the characters of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were not particularly likeable\nSo he sent me a note telling me of a story that I probably might have remembered I vaguely remember it as the story of when a Neil Armstrong came to Cincinnati and this was a good deal I think it was a ... well after I had left Cincinnati in Ninety One\nUh apparently what a puzzle ... who is a a University of Cincinnati engineering professor came from that area I think originally and had now at that point in time he became the spokesperson for Chrysler\nSo he came into the a Cincinnati auto inspection facility\nAnd he did a little public service thing reminding people get their cars inspected that sort of thing and something about the greatest story in the planet but a lot of people like me and this fellow or space geeks and he ... he said this to me because he knew I was a space geek is well\nAh he arrived at the inspection facility with a couple of other reporters to do the interview with Neil Armstrong and so they did the obligatory interview\nA and then when he was all done he went over and shook everybody's hand\nUh and the car hadn't been finished yet so for twenty minutes they they all stood around and talked\nAbout space program but Neil Armstrong family you want to know about their family or this guy by the way had also been in Dayton and Cincinnati the fellow I'm Talking about\n[noise] and um he now teaches I think at a broadcasting school or in some university if I'm not mistaken anyway he said that in person Armstrong was so very friendly it was like talking with your next door neighbor over the fence he was quiet\nBut his incredible intellect was obvious\nAnd so he's told the story to his children grandchildren and so forth meeting Neil Armstrong and I I did not ever meet and you know I met Buzz Aldrin on a couple of occasions I thought he was he just tickled\nSort of but uh in terms of\nI'm Sorry I just didn't know what the movie portrayed him as they portrayed him as intellectually a strong and smart guys thinker cetera et cetera et cetera but it didn't\nHe didn't come across as being likeable at least I didn't think he did
