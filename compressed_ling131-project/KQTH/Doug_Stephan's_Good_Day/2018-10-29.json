J. B. shore twenty eight past the hour [noise]\nHi I'm ... with the ... of the day you know frequently people ask me war and we looked to adopt the dog we're really looking for a puppy or a kitten\nAnd very often I explain to them that they should really be thinking we're re thinking about possibly adopting an older dog or cat\nYou know you get what you see when you adopt and all that you know what they look like how big they are going to be an older pets generally settled and easy and bond ... with their new family many older pets have already experienced parts of life like riding in a car going to the vet walk you're on a leash or just happy\nTo be with you all the pets no you save their lives and and pay you back every day for the record bears and that tackling their second third or fourth chance when you adopt older pet you can a race they are packed unpleasant experiences my loving and caring for them older pets grade the same sense of belonging and need to love that all living things to do something\nIf you think about adding a pep your family next time you go to the shelter rescue humane society check out some of the older dogs and cats they make great great pets and I promise you they will thank you every day for saving their lives ...\nI'm not all of a trauma diary of low scheme diary I\nBrush off again I don't get it is there something wrong with the way I waive although although rent that little town acknowledge me I'm friendly I get everyone peace of mind when they protect their homes their progressive jumping for joy when I Walk by\nIs terrible all of that as bad as we should words have power I understand that they do but what you're hearing right now is a narrative about people who\nI protect people's rights for hate speech if you want to say that you hate so and so I'm going to go out there and fight for you because we live in a country where our speech is protected and what's being done now if you listened very carefully you listen and very quiet you can listen\nThat they're trying to say and this is the news media narrative that is being fun\nThat words are going to now influence people's behavior and what slippery slope does that bring it down and brings it down to the limitations of speech and you know once we started doing that we lose who we are as the country and we can not be intimidated by these crazy people we have\nTo fight them and we have to prosecute them hard and I think Trump calling for the death penalty on the Senate God killer is absolutely appropriate absolutely\nSo here's the thing that happens Virginia Byrd comes to my mind as I listen to you that the the thing that shuts these\nOutfits down first of all this guy raised about a million bucks on a some kind of a I think it was a goal for me page last year but that means that there are people who were following him that I agree with the border\nGuy a guy the shooter or the the creator of the when the creator of the website and I'm not talking about the shooter I'm Talking about the website\nSo uh but the other side of the ...\nThe shooter or that the creator of the creator of the website and I'm not talking about the shooter I'm Talking with a website\nSo uh but the other side of the coin is that if you really feel strongly about this you don't have to you don't have to you're not required to do business with somebody like this if you don't agree with that might not shutting them down just don't do business like a radio program or TV program or whatever you don't like it don't buy the book\nThat's it period not somebody artificially shutting somebody that I did do something [noise]\nThat um I Hope will be instructive for a couple of minutes I looked at some stats now is I'm just talking to you and I actually did this last night a couple of weekends ago or if you go back through the four largest\nProblems we've had with shootouts the last maybe months let's take the last month New York city not one single shooting in the entire city for the past three Friday Saturday Sunday nights have you compare that to the\nThe last two three four weeks and in Memphis\nWe're about one tenth of the number of people live is in New York seven people were shot and killed\nAll seven of the victims were men six of the dead were between the ages of twenty three and forty nine and then you look at Chicago over the same weekends Seventy two people shot\nIn Chicago in that same period so how come should ups in carnage in Memphis how come should ups and carnage in Chicago and how come no shoot ups in New York a lot of people will point to the fact\nThat there are um the police are better in New York uh there is not as much gun allowance I don't know what\nThe law is or what the rules are the New York have one way in and one way out and that's why you don't the school in New York New York ... in video at least\nRight so I mean certainly did we a deadly weekends are not exclusive to Chicago in Memphis you can see that some things I Baltimore and a couple of weeks ago didn't they have in September a shootout in Baltimore where a number of people got killed\n'em but the this that the weather in New York City as of his training for police or whether it has the same as you suggested these public buildings one way and in one way out whether they'd curbs of it certainly is worth thinking about for me anyway why it is there's such a difference\nIs there is solution to gun violence and the New York has it why isn't it being replicated is the question from someone who are pulled the records of these cities back to Nineteen Ninety six and looked at the shootout and the biggest change\nHappened when Bloomberg was mayor of New York the rules changed in New York or at least more action the focus of the city to make things like you just suggested a reality make it safer not lots of noise about their early just do it\nWhatever it is is that you see this is what you get the blow hards who want to talk about gun control of the blow hards you say it's this or they say that it's that it's just talk action action action\nAnd they have action in New York\nThey've made it safer in New York police presence whatever it is so why can't these other cities by God Chicago is an outrage\nIt really is it's become a national joke 'cause it's so violent there but we are in a vat we have a valley I mean a violent society by the honest\n'cause it's so violent there\nBut we ... we have about ... I mean a violent society by a streak in us but\nNew York has dealt with it and I think a lot of people could learn from it I don't know about Los Angeles I don't remember much I don't hear even though I'm they're part of the I don't know that there's a whole lot of violence in Los Angeles I Can't put my finger on anything crazy lately is their Jennifer\n[noise] there's always violent but it's what I mean you know the violin no I think there is but you know there's a month and drugs and gangs and all the stuff that I think you see in a big city and I got it for sure Mm [noise]\nAlright well something to think about it anyway risk factors of living in a big city speaking of risk factors risk factors for hepatitis C include being fifty three to Seventy three years old is you know that\nHaving had a blood transfusion or organ transplant for Nineteen Ninety two it's time to learn more facts\nDid you know chronic hepatitis C can cause liver damage and lead to liver failure in fact it's the number one cause of liver transplants and the leading cause of liver cancer Hi\nI'm senator Nancy Todd from Colorado and board chair of women in government and I'd like to recognize this October as liberal awareness month today there are options available to help treat hepatitis C if you think you have hepatitis C visit a doctor to get tested and keep your liver healthy for more visit women and government dot org\nCentral tenant of the American dream as always been that the next generation would do better than the one before it\nEducation was the essential key because ...

spirit has and I wind up getting called once it gets to daddy you know when when when the husband and the family winds up feeling something and says okay that crazy what's going on over here yeah call you a psychic friend\nUm that's when I get called but I've been doing a lot of clearing out uh recently a lot of negativity begets negativity so you've got all of that going on all over the United states in the world and it actually brings them out even more so because they're mostly negative they're stuck there are they're frustrated\nThey're angry\nOr they're resentful right and misery enjoys company so they look for everybody else's miserable too so that's why I'm more of a coming out now\nI'm a ... because it is a ... game and the celebration of them with thinking about them so it brings into the surface and especially the way we celebrate Halloween with ghosts and ghouls right the\nRise silly or frankly your there's much more to this is you're pointing out I'm I'm not against having a good time I think Halloween the way we celebrated his just plain stupid or there are as you pointed out the all Hallows eve or the significance of people who are stuck\nHere uh and so I thought perhaps we ought to talk about what happens when somebody from the other side is trying to\nTouch into us a lot of people deny that they have psychic abilities the psyche connection even though I think you and I were on the same page would agree that we all have it it's tapping into it it's understanding it's it's letting it come in there's so much here\nAround Vincent that people don't want to admit to them so that even the simplest of contacts the shiver that you get in your shoulder when somebody actually is communique that's a communication and a lot of people that you know I just got chilly you know I\nThat's why they want to talk themselves out of it so that everybody knows without into wishing we wouldn't even be able to survive so intuition and psychic and this is the exact same thing 'cause you tapping into the same place\nBut has his psychic I have learned to open the doorway and hear a little bit more\nSo yes it and and those in spirit\nThey're just as much as we missed them they miss us they want to talk with us because they know what they've left behind whether they've left behind some mistakes are lower choices that they made or even some abuse\nRight they want to help us fix that they want to help us get through our lives and understand ourselves even more so because when you get to the other side you see the big picture and you're like smacking yourself in the head going oh my gosh I should add a V. eight um and and you've got all this disappointment than what you've left behind\nSo they're around this constantly we smell them okay that's interesting because I get a lot of clients as well as my self uh that will smell the aroma of past love what I mean my father had a distinct\nOdor and cologne that he always war and when I when I ... every so often I Will get a whiff of it and I don't deny it I don't say oh that's strange ah nah that's just my imagination I figure if it's in my head I smell it he must be there so I say hello to him\nI doesn't always have something necessary the said to me but with others there's always a comforting feeling there's always a a a this trying to get some information and the person starts feeling more gut feelings or whisper in the year\nMany times people are driving or they're doing something and they get distracted and at the last minute something makes\nMany times people are driving or they're doing something and they get distracted and at the last minute something makes them turn their heads and it's a good thing they did because they kept from hurting somebody else or running into somebody that's usually the whisper in our era going look\nKnow and and sometimes when we're not thinking about it we do we go and look you know and and then we go away why did I Do that okay never mind well thank goodness I did\nWell in your gut is very important I Am curious as to I I ask this of people who I Do a um\nA focus on this sort of thing every week on a program called your hidden power\nAnd the fact that people realize they have this thing the development sort of thing and they can use this sort of thing I Wonder and I often ask this how do you turn it off like you and I am and your conversation now\nHave you dug into me can you feel something for me and do you not want to we just want to have a conversation here but can you help yourself\nFrom figuring out what the person is all about that you're talking to whether it's here maybe in the grocery store you're driving and you'll get somebody to your left is going down the street or where does it stop and where does it begin\nA that's an excellent question and there's too many psychic medium to turn around and say I can't control this thing and think it's a gift that you can't control it actually if you can't control this thing you also can't control your life\nAh ... our brain has the filtration system naturally so you're not\nPaying attention to all the stimuli that's coming in at once your vision you're hearing your taste your smell your feeling you're not doing that all at once you usually do two of the time because it was be an an an overwhelming amount that stimulation coming into you well it's the same with the psychic sense\nAnd you can actually consciously and knowingly keep it off so rather than me turning it off like right now okay I'm getting on the phone with\nWith Doug I don't want to tap into him I don't have to do that I'm automatically off until I open it up ... and when I open it up the difference is I'm paying attention then\nTo another sense so just like you can I Want you to pay attention to what you're smelling right now you can direct all your focus to your smell sense I Want you to pay attention to what you're hearing right now\nAnd you can pay attention to that it's not that all of a sudden you go blind and you go um if you don't feel anything else but what you're doing is you're just paying attention\nThat's exactly what I Do with my sense is I pay attention to it and listen we don't sit and listen enough\nAs long as your brain is chattering you can't hear the intuition or feel of a gut feeling so you'll have to sit quietly what is that what is that that I'm feeling old I Need to go over here that today I'll make an appointment and I'll and I'll call the doctor and I'll go there you know it today not disappointment that so\nYou're absolutely right listening to the gut feeling is vital\nMouth matter of just focusing on it so no I did not reading you or anybody else until I Want to\nOkay so here's let me just go back to what you said a moment or two ago and I give you an example but I I Want people not to be in denial and they have the same experience yesterday I was driving I have a farm\nIn addition to being a broadcaster I'm a farmer and I was delivering hey a to a fellow in a different part of the state and I had actually it was driving all day long they're delivering picking up and doing that sort of thing and I as I'm driving along I my dog with me\nOn a different part of the state and I had actually it was driving all day long they're delivering picking up and doing that sort of thing and I as I'm driving along I my dog with me and I'm listening to the radio\nAnd it's not the first time it happens frequently but somebody came in to my mind into my thoughts and I felt the president we didn't have a long conversation but we had a conversation out some people would say a staff and urine nuts\nNow I have this happened to me frequently with people but it's more as you said because I'm thinking about it I'm open to it I had a conversation with my former wife\nThat lasted almost two hours and the drive that I took a month or so ago I've had people that were in my life\nThat I wanted to talk to them they just start talking to you and I feel like they're they're I Wonder if that's part of the vibration can you attract people in Vincent if you want to help\nI Will tell you this Doug about you you're an extremely sensitive person because of the work you do and because of even the show you are more open you're taking a spiritual journey in your life in general that opens your heart and the waves and the channels automatically\nSo now it it's a great time what do we do in the car where we're usually very quiet or listening to the radio or very\nThoughtful and thinking of all of these things so you kind of open to it and you accepted so as soon as you get the feeling of it\nYou could have gotten in your own way and then the message way by turning around and going out yeah but thinking about how the other day it yet is to let me turn this station on the radio you know and you could have been ignored it but you didn't you went with the flow you went with it and then the conversation was able to take place but\nYes that's the way it can happen for many people are now don't get me wrong it doesn't mean that I don't feel my mother or I don't feel other deceased loved ones coming intimate no\nI it it could be at any time during the day that I get a sense or feeling from somebody it's when I'm with other people that I can I'm On the control that I'm not feeling them
