Steven as an Arizona says my wife and I are in baby steps to those there'll be new that means are getting out of debt everything but their house\nShould be done in a year we're entering what looks to be a lengthy and intense custody battle with my ex wife\nWe have to hire an attorney and it looks like he'll be expensive should we pause baby step to to pay for this or should we hold our falling the paperwork until we have the debt paid off\n[noise] um\nWell the fact that you asked if you should hold off filing the paperwork tells me that that is an option see I don't know what is going on with this custody battle\nAnd all kinds of different things can go on there if I thought my child was in danger if I thought there was a predator [noise] uh that my ex was marrying or I thought uh some real extreme thing then I'm going to cause the baby step\nAnd we're going to take care of the cat that's primary but the fact that you mention\nIn your email that we could wait tells me that this is more like you are aggravated with her\nWhich would be like kind of standard operating procedure right so um if if the child is not in danger and is not is not harmed\nBy you waiting a year yeah I'd get out of debt before I entered a lengthy custody battle because it'll put you in a stronger position to enter that battle you'll have the cash flow to just stay in the game 'cause most of the time when you get in something like that the first one that runs out of cash is who loses not the first one who's right\nAnd so you got to have war chest man and um\nIf delaying it until your debt free one year from now is a is a reasonable option given the thinking about the good of the child than I Would because it'll be your best legal strategy to because you'll have the finances to keep pounding away and\nPounding away until the gates fall right but um\nOtherwise it's going to your ear you're fighting from a weekend position so you know I don't know what's going on so I Can't tell whether that's a couple of different ways of looking at it Chris is with us in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing great how are you better than I deserve what's up\nGood good to hear [noise] um I have a quick question my brother and I are are are going to small business and I'm Around last year my wife uncle had um had a sign up for what's called a ... an insurance policy\nNow I'm a little ignorant to add to what it is but he explained to me that at a contract to my wife any event she came I got to take care of it in the event than anything happen to me she kind of get my portion of the business but it also worked as a retirement fund the type of thing so I'm kinda just calling to see what\nWhat your opinion is of that type of power\nHis name but it also worked as a retirement fund the type of thing so I'm kinda just calling to see what what your opinion is of that type of policy and if it's necessary or or what I what I should do\n... team in is what it's doing it's not a type of policy so let's separate the two things sold you a piece of crap called a whole live life insurance policy because it has built it is okay has a built in savings program\nOkay so we're we're going to cancel the stupid policy alright ... simply means is typically used in in a situation like you're in in business uh by cell agreement\nAnd the way it would work is that uh you you said you're in business with who your brother\nMy brother okay and so uh let's say you died the life insurance on you would go to him giving him the money to buy your share of the business\nFrom your wife okay because he doesn't want to be a partner with your wife\nOr not because he ate your wife maybe because you had your wife but not because he had your wife but more likely because she didn't want to be in the business right so if you're on the air and you do it in reverse as well he needs to buy a policy on him that goes to you but it's state in in the\nPartner should have the same thing we're both okay so you're both going to cancel this grabbing the world's going to get up we bought a piece of crap\nYeah you're going to buy term life insurance little do the same thing for about a nickel on the dollar for what you're seeing now okay what's the face of milder that's what's the face of math is given to him if you die\nOr her um I have to I'd have to look back I don't I don't remember what we signed up for like I said it was it says well over a year ago\nOkay I'm In a bit and putting in you know paying their premiums yeah the premium I suppose [laughter] have you know like a ten year you\nKnow have articles are are you in L. L. C. or\nAre you a general partnership or an escort escort okay do you have articles of incorporation that defined what happens in the event of death\nUm I'm not sure if it finally happened to me than a\nDad and now I'm not I don't know you need to have a what's called a by cell\nAgreement okay and it's funded by inexpensive term life insurance\nTerm okay the trivia with attorney or certain if there's a whole like all the\n... whole lives as the only one that has a retirement benefit later okay I got that means it as a savings element and that means it's twenty times more expensive for the same amount of insurance\nRight now you got me he's like oh when you're you know when you're sixty this is what are the cash cash value will be yeah yeah and you start heating act number at the end and I'm like okay\nSo here's the thing if you spend one acts instead of twenty X. two accomplished your business goal\nOf being able to buy out the widow of the one that there's a lot that died right uh that's the business go and you spend one acts of doing that use the other Nineteen next to invest and you'll have a whole lot more money than you would have had inside this piece of crap policy that he bought and sold you\nOkay that's the problem ... life insurance has a horrible right of return it's loaded with fees\nAnd ah if you die they do not pay you the money that's in savings that you pay the extra create they only pay the face value and so the ... the money that you're playing for the money that you're paying extra for to create savings is all being done poorly that's the problem here\nI got a guy that makes sense yeah I'm ... I'm a new listener so I you know six months I've kinda been grinding Mickey at my watch it on our own baby step to cool I'm now going to want to cash out that\nWhatever and then the whole like yeah yeah and then you go with the term ... or you get term policy\nNow we're going to want to cash out that whatever it is in the whole like yeah yeah and then you go with the term ...\nOr you get term policy in place first case she died while the ball right an issue but once it's in place and you cancel the garbage policy but again you're going to save so much money doing this and you can accomplish the goal and it's going to help you clean up your ass Corp\nCorporate documents by having your attorney or it's not it's a one page thing but it's yeah and then you need to cover that with all the for abuse it down their spouses and go okay\nIf he dies I won't be getting money to buy\nYou out sister in law okay you're going to be out of the business that's our thing and um and if I die my\nWife's going to be out of business 'cause my brother's going to buy her out and he's gonna have the money to do that from life insurance\nFrom the guy from this new term policy\nAnd it it has stated that that money has to be used for that\nOr that specific bought for ... yeah yeah\n... that's the by cell agreement very standard stuff in a situation like you're in\nOkay awesome I really appreciate your health\nThank you brother thanks for calling him open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money [noise] John is on Facebook what do you think of group life insurance is is a life insurance today\nUm group live insurance means that you're buying life insurance through your company that's what you would have to I mean by that that's the only type of group life insurance that is because you can't buy life insurance on into our group\nYou buy a lot of insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished to you through your company as a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance benefits package or life insurance benefits package\nUm I it's okay to buy that\nIt's usually if you are buying it you know if it's free of your employers furnishing it frees free shut up okay but if you're paying for it it's usually not that much cheaper it's maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is it's not portable and what that means in insurance world as you leave the company\nYou can't take it with you so let's say you had a cancer scare or a minor heart attack and now you're not sure\nYou get diabetes now you're not in ...\nAnd you leave that company you got in a life insurance that you can't take this with you [noise] says okay to have a little at the company but I wouldn't have it all there this is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big time extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life you see changing these habits is the foundation of our teachings at those smart conferences and I'm excited to announce this fall and\nFun very cool you know that's what what I signed the ... or the total money make over a book with the scripture I use romas twelve to to be transformed bother renewing of your mind now don't be conform to the world they're crazy out there\nDon't be don't be like everybody else they're nuts and ah my pastor always said don't let the world teach theology you know and\nAre so good stuff you guys so what do you tell people when they find that you got forty nine thousand dollars worth of debt paid off what are you don't like the keys to getting out of debt are\nBut like I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh I always wanted to drive a newer car I never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset that you're always going to have a car payment and so you know you pay for a car for five or six years and they would against it then you're going to get another payment and and uh so we have not had a car\nPayment for four years we were driving to very old cars one\nIs sixteen years old the other one's eleven years old while but we drove it up here from South Carolina this morning and it made it finds out and made it finally gets us where we need to go and you know never again never again\nWell now you don't any payments or you can save up in ...

thirty eight percent of you lie to your spouse about money [noise]\nWow\nAnd you wonder why your marriage isn't topping out isn't awesome [noise]\nNow I mean it can be a little white lies the target bags under the bed\nSnickers sneaker right or or it can be big Tom credit card debt it can be won over years running a business and is running up debt down at the business and not telling your spouse because you're trying to live your dream is turning into a nightmare\nLet me just to clarify this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you didn't already know that did you [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] she was one of a smaller fires quickly so here's the thing\nIf you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase\nOr a financial issues that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that is a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm also down talk Sharon Hi Elena bothers toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean that again you have too many guns already\nAnd most of them on TALK shows and hey I Want to buy this toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy thing Andrea and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another but you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those have got too much too many like toys right [noise] uh for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to share and about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to\nOne of those guns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there's not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's the one of the seven habits to talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated\nBy you to the spouse is an arrogant rebellious immature\nPrints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child in the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden debt though it's the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and its shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation base hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible dislike that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband you shouldn't dump it all on either one of your both of you should\nBe involved and I want to be again can carry the ministry of weight wants all the decisions are made but everybody ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nYou probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who would almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I'd been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air I'm Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nFamilies on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] that's what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said was partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not love and his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof he's freaking clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially his fault and he owes or an apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand all over the debt and he don't even know what the flips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated to her as Oprah this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect\nYou would never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture he said and now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got eighty grand and debt that he didn't know he had and oh man it looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm Stan I'm making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time it's you just did you're just dumping on it and then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away and close your eyes and what we'll do ... well\nYou know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nDidn't work out well the rest of the show but we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month against a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increased their level of communication tenfold increase their level of ...\nIt was on paper on purpose increased their level of communication\nTenfold increase their level of cooperation tenfold increase their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize\nThey began to agree on their goals and their productivity what their money goes through the roof or you'll feel like you've got a raise when you've learned through this together\nOn paper on purpose before the ... begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software for every dollar the best out for your phone every dollar of every dollar a name [noise]\nDid you know there are more than two million or real estate agents in this country\nUm you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really like it you say that\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God looks down and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that kind of happened was with us 'cause\nYou know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors and we were able to pay off with a much quicker re a lot quicker than we thought because\nWe didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just looking at all the student loans we thought how are we going to pay this off\nAre we going to get home do all these different things started family but um you know definitely goes on our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this in a\nPretty good parents know how how do you explain to other people will because I Know I Know what the answer is but\nHow do you explain to other people the level of intensity that is required cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game all\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was um mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us then and we just had made the decision in our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so\nI had and we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know and it was normal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life\nAnd Sally money's going to be a room mate for life\nRight by guys though people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could fit into your life that we had just made the decision like you know art student loan was just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we were really we were ready and willing to do I'm told to do those zero budget you know there's Iraq's and budget everything out and every dollar had an assignment and every extra dollar went through my student loans though we were making payments like in the grand jury making payments to having dogs and a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so um you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nLive to two years bike and that lifestyle you know but and I would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to say I really had to praise through um just the frustration of that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted in the spirit um to really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and you kind of and he had countless hours worked\n... hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days or weeks then months out of time um but he was just very focused and just stay prayer and\nStayed in prayer to really I'm kind of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd those are the pains of it was it worth it yeah I don't know you're completely free yeah good yeah\nI Know what else should get out of this it's like when you climates\nAnd now you're completely free yet good you know what else should get out of this it's like when you climb a wall but that tall you kind of come away going we can free can do anything [laughter] I mean\nThere are crushes strengthens me but I mean we can do anything I was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of your married life you know you didn't sit on the on the couch and watch Oprah reruns of wine is

M. direct messaging\nYour urban word of the day thank you for saying that in dated urban place about our understanding is that there were ... or by word of the day we damn stress shore cranium\nBut I've been dealing with since July the town the downhill slope that show has put us on Israeli dealing with a demolition derby [laughter] Grassley\nMan he was all fired up today so as Mitch McConnell monitors that why you might want to me ha ha\nThere's no way anything we did would satisfy the Democrats no oh they've always got a reason while the goalposts needed to be moved\nYeah absolutely absolutely so there you go\nYou will never going to survive you would never satisfy them ever is nothing about this there was ever going to have three ... three five three twenty four twenty three ... ... what what scares you of capital that's me I'd like to hear from a tweet at me you can damage if you want to do as well man\nPoll among joined just talk a little pack some crazy stuff out there let's change directions Chevys Joe [noise]\n\nSuch Chad bend to show [noise]\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanics mind something wrong and surprise your head\nWith a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty your paying out of your own pocket to fix it that's why I recommend extended vehicle protection from costs you if your car has five thousand two hundred and fifty thousand miles car shield\nBased on what the ethics as derogatory so it's going to be policing our language before you can sit sin it's going to say do you really want to say this here's alternative ways to say your thoughts\nYou know what you know a lot of times it is what I mean like it or not what I post maybe what I mean\nAnd the fact they're wanting to police are politeness seems really odd isn't not you don't always want to be polite\nYou know what if it would it be Richard you know as we already had that now it's like you go on to things did you have you come on everybody we all tried to type a certain word and it comes out with a ducking [laughter]\nLet's not pretend that we haven't won like and it doesn't make sense of people like that's totally stupid come on now we've already got that I don't want a I telling me I Can't tweet something that may be offensive because everything's offensive nowadays so I might as well at least enjoying\nEverything everything offensive to somebody and so that becomes the fear on this who's training to a guy and who's trained to think something's offensive so what you're getting another one of those giant technical glamorous being able to control speech and that's\nWhenever anytime that happens that's a bad thing because you just want people to be able to be a jerk and they want to be a jerk or be nice if they want to be not\nAs a you know it's just that we got enough issues with tech right now in Silicon valley running the world and and and the craziness of that and trust me I I deal with it on a daily basis basis trying to do stuff hey that Facebook hacking thing like I don't think a lot of people understood how big that was one of the reasons they didn't\nIs it's being reported that Facebook was purposely not allowing those stories into its own\nWell one of the reasons they didn't is it's being reported that Facebook was purposely not allowing those stories into its own feet so stories about they were being hacked was being blocked as spam by baseball so that was interesting to me\nI was like there is an example of when a giant corporation can't control a message\n[laughter] this is the message he says it was bad for them and they're you know their algorithms are saying oh yeah we should allow that through that spans what wasn't span that happens\nYeah like you're not fooling anybody off the establishment media it's not real real talking to pull the Mona or a tech guru we moved from there to this is what I find interesting we're going to do as we know more and more about the brain we're going to get to the point where we can\nReally understand it and eventually you know I say we're going to be downloading all kinds of stuff and you may live forever may not be in the body or in right now maybe an other bodies are inside of a computer and all of this stuff\nBut as far as like violent people shocking the brain 'cause we've always tried stuff on the bottom ease we've tried shocking stuff we try to potentially shocking the brain could make you less violent\nAnd so a new study where they've they've brought a bunch of violent offenders mostly you know physical violence back in the sexual assault type of vendors and they struck their brains and they asked them on a scale from one to ten how likely are you to\nWant to do this again how I Want to you know get physically violent and\nIt was really resting forty seven to Seventy percent of people reduced their what their wants or their desire to express in a violent manner\nThey were able by this ... in the brain it was giving them the ability it seems to readjust their thought process and re channel that anger in a way that was it a violent aggressive act that would be physically attacking someone\nYeah as a ... minute treatment what this is a small\nStudy I also look at it in in how we gonna do this in in the future when it comes to things like people with post traumatic stress disorder or memories\nWhere maybe we can block it or shock it out of you as if it doesn't happen and there's a worry that if you do that you may change the person that you are today but is it better doing that than living with the thing that has happened in your life\nBullets and sometimes maybe you want to change the person you are today you are becoming a super it the first person or a super problematic person you're not be able to to really cope with life\nThey have seen when it comes to depression potentially twenty plus percent improvement using a electric magnetic electro magnetic stimulation of the brain\nOn depression patients so if it helps with that and that's something you know you don't want to be a depressed person and we society don't want violent people running around so if you're in prison could this be somehow instituted were prisoners that are violets get this as part of their therapy before they're released from prison\nArea decided they said it's not like doing not I'm not doing you know the bottom ie not you know and it's not you know something that would be invasive to pace and it's like ... year for twenty minutes in this contraption that goes on your head and we will treat you for your violent behavior I think it's worth a try\nAbsolutely you know what the outside the box talking to ... ah and finally last ... for all of those you out there who was super excited about the fight from Fifteen ah people at the fast food restaurants and we saw yesterday that a lot of us read in fast food on a daily basis and has become a way of life here in America\nAnd guess what the burger people who are serving you may be leaving the touch screens are coming but there is a bad thing because what do we do ball\nWe buy more and that's the death ... for uh\nBut there is a bad thing because what do we do ball\nWe buy more and that's the death ... for uh the the regular human service\nThey realized the McDonald's is put all these touch screens and a bunch of their stores and they're talking about putting at least a thousand touch screens or a thousand stores will be adding touch screens to them every year or they're gonna try and make getting faster than a year and the reason why is\nIt is fun they realized people find it fun and because it's fun they order more\nSo once they hit that big corporations bottom line Burger King Wednesday everybody's going to say why don't we put touch screens in here if people are going to have fries with it [laughter] have you know the super size to drink and order maybe you know deserves\nThe touch screen takes the place of everything that you can't really train a person at the counter to do which is up sell your food items they try to but it never really apparently works as much as it does when you're in front of a computer screen it feels like a game almost edition of buying food\nIt's a game and it's a game that's when you're sitting there and and I've I've done it you know walk into some of the newer McDonalds and stuff and I look and there's a line for me because people for no reason to also knows there's also people are scared\nTo go into those thing and it's the same thing when I go to a movie theater and there's a line and then there's two chaos that are just and like people are still this fear that that somehow that's not going to give you something to get inside the theater or your food's not going to impossible for that to for me to order there I got to go to this kid [laughter]\nAnd and and so you don't have to go from the computer knew those that's the other thing so judgment do how many Big Mac [laughter]\nThat's the other thing it's like oh my God I can only three of these members as many as I Walk out the theater you're not you're not going to just make computer I mean as much as I Want [laughter] wouldn't that be like if you go or I'll take to double a quarter pound or if you're really\nReally you don't really lately\nBut I noticed when I go into these places I go to the movie theaters that people are afraid to use the touch screen like it's not real and I just go over not being bing bing bing bing bing bing and it is kind of fun 'cause I can do it myself and the whole time I get out of bed that you've had any Byard which I don't think it's nice either but I Do think that a lot\n[laughter]\nBut it was it it kind of fun I have to admit it they've got his animations that come on screen and your ears to and also it's really easy to customize\nYes as you can tell I'm an effigy auto McDonald's ordering as [laughter] usually systems quite a lot and I can have like extra onions in or know mayonnaise or whatever just a few punches my finger\nAnd I don't have to worry and check like you do with the drive through did they actually hear me and they actually get my order right that's right because the only thing that you hit the hits him to the back of the ...\nThat is so she had her I said I don't like my I grew up and right if I screw up its on me if I tell you something to screw up and I got a check all the time because I Know the chances are and the sounds horrible to say it for a lot of places around the country\nMaybe English isn't the first language and there's a there's a there's a barrier and a gap there and it's tough and oh good to me you can just go\nPlus you can customize and a lotta times there's things you want and then you go up there and you're like if you're telling somebody you just like okay this is how I really want it but I'll take this if you get half of this right I'm good you know that you get the whole thing right and it's easy ... and if the game yeah what a cheeseburger\nPutting took and I want to cookies on it when you're young [laughter] and well known assuming\nIt ... go ahead go ahead\nI was gonna say if if this weekend\nAnd well known as sue go ahead go ahead no I was gonna say if you if this we are talking about the pocket [laughter]\nIf

restaurant open the Pasadena to try out a robot cook and they just announced today there was just kind of a side but interesting they got a robotic in late drywall\nSo it's ... so the robot can lay drywall in construction he can definitely give you a big\nYeah no absolutely Aslam ... genius you're genius or I Love having on talking about food this is just like Anthony Bourdain but in a much more
