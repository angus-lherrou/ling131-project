ago and now the loans are kicking and then if I would've got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying 'em off sooner but\nI Will I Am get free or two years ago we had our first child and

return for going into debt fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lot of overtime and the path so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent increase my base\nIt didn't show on the paper called your check not yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true ... and I've always felt pretty smart with money so I I have a positive net worth right now four hundred thousand between my four oh one big assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I I'm not terrible but I just want to know\nWhat kind of way gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nI have a hundred thousand in vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollars\nYeah [laughter] [noise] thanks for\nWas like five five five Andy amateurish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped by\nCars that were in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question we do we have\nA question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs in ... in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a\nThe the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is on your own all and we'll be rented or on we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it at that\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from\nYou for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or which happens to be your non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of\nA you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the ... the good so the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands are land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah keep that separates a infiltrate the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liabilities right with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords ... you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you'd said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and they cause this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing him on his liability do do hold harmless agreements a carry any weight in any of this\nUm no I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm the\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um that's\nA liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk\nI but I hold harmless is it what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful [laughter]\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean ... they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and I think\nStill loose so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new national holiday that this is something that you've touched on our why\nI'm so I'm new to the baby and I know that number one we have the thousand dollar emergency find my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment where this job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years on or never happened to act we really lucky we've never been laid off you go in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to work\nOn something when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws on them want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as well we all ... and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one didn't as a dental discount program\nAnd um that would be baby step forward and I do that first and a Roth IRA and then I Do it in a ... T S P after that\nIf they're matching I don't think they do but if they're matching you on the ... going to start their with Iraq with a match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate it it's good to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey what is that while I was\nA one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and pay off any other debt also that I have\nOh I'm not sure that that if you got\nThe gift to cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nOkay so your debt free but two cars and the two houses\nRight okay how much do you own your cars I'm fifty thousand on bald each\nOr total on both total okay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty\nOkay you got a lot of car and um so what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm and the rental and now my my rental Ohio one fix the un is worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has four fifty but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right [noise]\nSo on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nCan say I'm you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know when you start doing what forty fifty grand a year at that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car I'm ordering shoulder rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and ... most of the party much taller rent on pay off pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind for that but I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nI don't know how house by managing cash flow that right okay good no doubt no the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore right now my credit card check that out there and they let me get right by a car\nYou pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not and\nSo if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college now say about ... mission where the rentals with cash or go alone out there in the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental and pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building towards junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered a by just don't want to start in a savings account the junior college junior colleges do within their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby step share the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the soil that rental I Would I Love rental property but I Love being debt free more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call man we're pretty sure you're joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life in your money it's a free call the phone number is

I'm not exactly sure\nWhat to think that there is not the beneficiary of that ad or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a trial yeah this is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd at ... ... dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay if it's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my dad and I found out the beneficiary and I go I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's\nLike I don't care as a guy doesn't matter if we had a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very unlike the greyhound on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married a long you been\nYeah yeah how long have you been married ... how long you been married five years you know and then five years they've not address this issue that strength just drops I Know it really I mean they should you should\nAddress the issue and they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy on this is a whole lot of policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and my dad's\nA I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want to pay that kind of thing you know and then it cuts but you have all\nIt's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm a question regarding out part of my retirement savings said comes as a thing called a pinch him from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as ... or\n... or ...\n[noise] well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a projected retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total as pets you know and\nAnd my question is whether good at it as a lump sum yes or ... okay yes\nHere's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you can take that two hundred Ninety five thousand you could rolling into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal\nRight\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but Mm uh\nIt's still you know if you die then yeah you gotta survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept ... so the bottom line is it's got a decent\nI Love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low\nRate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal and so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to Iowa race and invest them and good roast our mutual fund so it sounds like your network didn't exist from a million\nA yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total network to assets house and so forth\nYou know well ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire one for that but ... before that happened\nA millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were Ella typically young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nAre shutting patterns or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell by twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [laughter] well\nI certainly you got to a live well below your means live they bought a modest lifestyle which ah we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things ... I think if you can limit\nThis thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that it\nMay cause McKay every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things but then you can minimize those new things along the way\nIn a way of a modest lifestyle with below you mean I'm no void\nSo do you think you're going to be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize those stupid yeah maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple and the math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nThe question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there it's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire [noise]\nOh I Love this millionaire subject is so when\nThe people

and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a low income than have to generate a lot she's only a couple of hundred bucks short a month\n... and above sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay so what we're saying is is that you know that there's this houses really poorly managed\n... don't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in ... but the last year I think that any\nKind of women if she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um her checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drained her checking account\nOkay I Gotcha yeah than let's cash it out and put it in a good mutual fund or a couple of good mutual funds and let's walk through a child wouldn't do

eleven hundred miles from where they are now and you've got kids got all kinds of people man you're committed you're absolutely a hundred percent committed committed committed\nIn something like this and this is going to continue the weekend where\nThe bomber will be front and center the rhetoric will be front and center the arguing will be front and center the blame game will be front and center Monday it'll be a little bit more and that's kind of that will be the tail end up putting it to bed and then it'll here's a little things here and there are about it\nBut what will start to happen is come Monday afternoon Tuesday them all week 'til midterms this I Believe will start to become something big and this is very interesting\nI Want you guys to listen to this right 'cause this this right here I find this to be absolutely some of the most racist\nHorrific things according to the left that you will ever here in these three people or leading the charge in this hatred\nIllegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S legally\nI voted on numerous times when I was a senator or to spend money to build a a a barrier to try to prevent on illegal immigrants from coming in we\nSimply cannot allow people support in the United states undetected undocumented unchecked\nThose three people who I Believe I've gone on to do some things in politics or Hillary Clinton she went on to a annoy us and never go away but she was secretary of state and think that was\nA senator as well first lady ah the last gentleman a was a senator at the time when he said that and he went on to do something else I I think he wrote a book but then he was president for eight years so there was that and then the first guy of course is chunky from the rocky movies and he's done several sequels that\nSee how they change your ... see the game I mean that's that that is the game we ... how is the wind blowing quick oh yeah it's going that direction so I Need to be in this direction\nMarriage equality or traditional marriage right now I'm all traditional I could grow in a few years and depending on which way the wind's blowing a I could be on the uh marriage equality it's the game that people play and it's that's how it's being used and it's frustrating\nIt is absolutely frustrating or we need to figure out what we're going to do with this and my frustration comes from the sense that we know what's coming\nAnd this is a small thing the caravan compared to the overall but the optics of it or bank\nAnd as they're coming here what we're going to have is two groups of people Republicans and Democrats who are going to argue it's two people reaching for a glass of milk\nMilk falls over the glass falls to the ground one of them says you did that you need to clean it up the other one says no you did that you need to clean it up and then it\nGoes on and on and on and all the while the glass of milk\nAnd\nMilk itself lays on the floor and it doesn't go anywhere and they argue over it and eventually the people live and\nThe milk itself lays on the floor and it doesn't go anywhere and they argue over it and eventually the people arrive and what has been happening will continue to happen and that is the frustration that so many of us feel out there\nThat is it and the Democrats there they play the game they play the game remember what they said and this is what Tucker Carlson that because\nIf they're talking about of all if you talk about immigration reform in the way that they don't like you get cold certain things\nAn Asian laws that must be ignored disagree with any of that by the way you think nations need borders in orange county nations the cable news genius has to have a message for you shut up\nRacist than just crumbs native is base very very excited every day\nAnd they look at these people as less than human they believe that those folks are are less than humans and they believe that they don't deserve asylum I Believe that you know which is in cages was the net benefit for this country Donald Trump wants you to know that he have the same pay people you have if you have Muslims\nIf you have black people if you have anyone who live south of the Rio Grande\nNow\nBut we heard what the others said right like you know they shouldn't come here and they just can't\nIt's if the game it's it's an absolute game and depending on which way the weather and the wind is blowing it's the way that they're going to go uh I don't have any of these people\nI in fact empathize with these people\nIn many ways I can look at it in and said to myself my God we have people who have been stuck in the mid west in in in in the rust belt for years who can't get off their asses at times to go hey maybe I Need to go somewhere else where there's actual a work and potential and they'll stay there and I and\nI can be honest and say you know I'm not a big fan of maybe you should go somewhere right if it's not working for you there maybe go to another part\nBut they have the right to do that these people don't have a right to come in our country\nSome of these people probably do need asylum I'm not some idiot that they'll take some of these people are some of these people are all just you know some of these people probably\nAre and potential danger because of the corruption because of a lot of stuff that's going on down there the the gang warfare the drugs all that stuff yes all of them\nBut it's a game and nobody is going to do anything about it and come December first ... give or take a few days\nThey will arrive some in Mexico some and Arizona Southern California and then there'll be given their you know court dates and a good majority of them will show up but that won't be for a couple of years because they're so backed up and we'll be talking about the next caravan a month after that\nTwo three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from your twin poll up about monsters monsters UGA yes\nGood monsters not bad monsters and by that I mean now these people we call here are villains Michael Meyers Jason Vorhees people of that nature and I question of the day is\nWho is your favorite Michael Meyers leads the back Jason number is is dead last he's only got nine friday with twenty three percent thirty to a lot of people saying what about Dracula what about Frankenstein who's Frank his name's not his name his name was ... monster but you know they don't really given as your name's Clinton [laughter]\nHorrible name for a monster but whatever will come Clint a you know because you're black or mommy Dracula and Freddie Krueger the reason I think people like Freddie Krueger Dracula is because they talk right\nUh you know because you're black who'd mommy Dracula and Freddie Krueger the reason I think people like Freddie Krueger Dracula is because they\nTalk right they talk and that's\nLike cool like the wolf management right when he became the wolf Mitt in those old movies and Frankenstein just ooh Dracula was like hey check it out like I'm a European like you know dude hanging out in the castle\nAnd I can make chicks fall in love with me was like the you know with my own and then you got Freddie was like always talking smack and so I think they they had the edge in a in a weird way but there's something about Michael Meyers in that mask and just the fact that even if you talk to him\nThere's something about the weirdness of not being able to get through to him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Tucson",
