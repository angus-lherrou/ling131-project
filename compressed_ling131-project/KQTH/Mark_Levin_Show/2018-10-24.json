I'm right now there for one a and for three B. and fidelity\nOkay um well the four oh one K. is after tax correct so that doesn't have any penalty took converted to a rough I always suggest\nAs a general rule when you leave your employer\nTake everything that's best did enroll it into an IRA and good growth stock mutual far you're more accessibility more control and more options to pick from in the open market than you do leaving something behind in trying to manage it through a former employer right now that I Would not converted\nVerdict to a Roth if it's pre tax unless you're out of debt have your emergency fund and have some extra money to pay the taxes of that creates but the four oh one hey you can go ahead and stick that into a rough it doesn't cost you a dime\nBecause there's already after tax money that's in there um you know there could be some growth in there that how you don't pay taxes on possibly um but it probably wouldn't be much\nSo just you know ... are you out of debt\nOn my will be I have about ten thousand dollars left on a student loan but um by the time I make this transitional that covered\nOkay well then the other question is when you're not going to have your emergency phone number ... so we're not we don't do anything that creates any taxes so when you sit down with your smart Mr pro roll it all over to Iowa raise\nA traditional IRAs unless you can move some of it to a Roth IRA in similar mutual funds um without any taxes and then later on if you want to convert it to Rob from traditional the taxes that are created you just need to be able to pay those in cash\nThis one from one shaky th juice on the news and talk\n[noise]\nOwns a AAA eight to five\nFive two to five Jacob follows me on Earth Day Ramsey what's the best way to decide which payment plan I should go with from my student loans a minimum\nPayments on every thing except your smallest loan and throw every dollar you can possibly throw it when it's gone attack the next one down when it's gone attack than actual down that's called the debt snowball and that is the most efficient way and the most the highest probability way to get out of student loan debt\nVery fast and very hard do not get into income based repayment plans do not get into I'm going to pay the minimum I can pay I Want you pay the freaking maximum you can pay doesn't want Sallie Mae evicted yet that old ugly woman out of your house\nShe is not a good roommate you want her to leave Louis is on\nFacebook should pull a thousand dollars on my four one K. to do baby step one\nOh you don't cash out of four O. one K. except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure when you take money out of your four o one K they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax rate\nNow that means if you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year household income your tax rates twenty five percent plus ten percent that means you just got charged thirty five percent interest\nIn fact\nI mean it's not technically interest it's penalties in taxes but you never borrow money thirty five percent interest to fund your baby step one no\nNo no no no no\nNo or would you use that to pay off debt thirty five percent hit no no\nWell they told me they're only ... percent out that's all they're required to withhold but that's not the calculation of how much the government keeps you in the\n... the government keeps you in the teeth out of ten percent penalty plus your tax rate you do not cash out retirement accounts unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure save your home yeah or if you're so far in debt it's the only way you keep from filing bankruptcy yeah you would do that\nBut at that point you're beyond desperate you're in deep weeds you know but definitely not never catch it out to buy a car or you know is is that kind of stupid stuff that people do all the time no never never and I was with us in Washington DC Hi Anna how are you\nI have I'm doing well\nThank you for taking my question should go into that sex my husband and I purchased our first home\nAnd kidnapping at eight and market crash and flash value of her house now ... years ago our family through and we bought a new home twenty percent down twelve years now and our first home at ... foot worry about it for it and we\nWait a minute wait a minute that that's not economic there's something else going on\nI carry a few places in the United states has not recovered after twelve years would you buy a ... or what\nI I don't understand it either 'cause we live in northern Virginia which is like very close to Washington DC and right now it's worth two hundred and Ninety five gay I bought it at um\nWashington DC and right now it's worth two hundred and Ninety five K they bought it at um according to my ... and we bought the house at three hundred and fifty K.\nA recent comparative market analysis by quality real estate agent says this house is worth three hundred grand\nOkay is that what you're telling me yes so\nYou must have done the world's worst real estate deal\nI I that well it likely satellite I we bought the house into that\nBut I think you know what I own it up and an eighth [laughter] I'm Sorry that you owe on it\nUm right now we know about sixty chaotic o salad\nCrowd we should salad it's crap\nThe world's worst house well we there's a faded twelve years it sucks [laughter] so you don't think we should wait for it we we are you willing to suck more two years\n[laughter] All right do you that that actually my question because right now we're at ... baby step number six\nHere's the thing and we gave you three hundred thousand dollars in cash would you go by the house next door\nKnow why because there's so much\nThis neighborhood is not appreciating for some reason or another it's the world's worst rate of return meanwhile the rest of the nation gripped way down and his up twenty percent\nI I I agree with you I this is why I'm calling in because I'm trying to decide if we can pay their rent this out no and wait until okay\nNo it's a bad investment it's a bad neighborhood I don't know what's wrong here but I I mean a ... a house you pay three and fifty thousand dollars for in two thousand freaking six before the crash it goes down and it's not even recovered back to three fifty it mean that's a very unusual real estate market unusually bad\nAnd I don't want to invest in it and going forward and so I wouldn't keep it going forward take your take your loss and get out you bought in a really bad place for some reason I don't know what's wrong but that's the worst numbers I've heard and I don't know when\nI mean everywhere else just about as recover Florida went down the Knicks went down freak in Las Vegas crashed and has recovered\nYou know I mean but there's some you know there's some parts of Detroit that habit but those are economic pockets but it's not an overall national economy thing and so you don't buy in bad economic\nPockets yeah and you don't keep in bad economic pockets and so out of there I'm Out of there from you amount of they're done quickly done yes thanks for the call appreciate you joining us sucks All right Heather's with us in Raleigh North Carolina Hi Heather how are you\nI'm going to have you are to better\nAnd then I deserve votes up in your world\nOkay I have a question on how long it take me to pay off my that\nMuch that you have not counting your house\nThirty five thousand what your household income\nI make my full time job and make thirty five [noise] um when my part time work I can make anywhere between forty five fifty\nWell we were doing better part time and your your fold them\nIn an area that combined oh okay okay God already quit at the foot down by the okay\nSo fifty is your ... your oh thirty five on what\nUm it's a car and I my home equity line which I combined my student loans in my pre existing home equity line\nYeah okay and how much do you own your stupid car\nIt didn't wind up paying you know make when Eli yuck okay and how much do you own your stupid car twenty sell it and yeah\nYou don't make thirty five thousand dollars a year driving toward that was our car that didn't work\nYou got too much tied up and things going down in value and you've got a four hundred and fifty dollar car payment don't you\nFind that almost like I've done this before [noise] [noise] yeah yeah that's killing you it is not a blessing is it kind of the car\nIs not a blessing\nIt's financially killing you it owns you you work for this car\nYour part time job that you took is because of this car\nIt's not worth it sell the car\nAnd then work your way through the debt and then you'll be debt free in about a year year and a half max and then and you know including the car that you buy that is very very cheap that years like five thousand dollar car that you pay cash for or you pay it off very very quickly with your other debts but\nI mean you love this car if you want but I don't love his car it's a stupid car and it's killing you your numbers are horrendous on this um\nIf you have more than half of your income tied up in cars or things with motors in them all totaled up then you have too much of your life shot up and things that are going down in value and you're always going to struggle\nIt's causing you to be middle class or lower middle class socio economically speaking financially speaking and it's all because of a choice of what you're choosing to drive I Would not choose to drive that\nI Would rather be wealthy and drought whatever I Want later Dr like no one else will later

you tell people to key to getting out of debt and\nOh that's a that's a great question um one thing I can say is you you have to be committed a once you agree to do something you have to be committed to do it and and you have to see beyond your current situation you have to see what you want to be more than you see where you are Mm\nSo once you can see beyond that then you can start to dream a and and there's many times where we actually drove through neighborhoods and looked at is a nice houses and say you know when we do this right we can go pick a house and we can do that ... ... well he wants to do it right\nYou know I hadn't thought about that sharing and I used to do that we would go drive the rich neighborhood and that's and go you know someday we could do that and here's all we

eighty billion dollars for quitting [noise] uh but\nUh no\nI wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't worry about any of these scores by the way because they're all based on you borrowing money\nAnd so

[noise]\n\n\nSuch adventure show [noise]\nDo you like saving money do you like knowing someone has your back as you're getting older and starting to be faced with the reality of Medicare and the future of Social Security my partners at the association of mature American citizens otherwise known as a Mac are focused on protecting the interest of mature Americans meaning anyone over fifty I'm partnering with a Mac\nYeah OK let's just talk about some of their taxes back in the day a Astrid\nLingering who is a she's the author of this book in this series called ...\nAt one time the marginal tax rate was above a hundred percent\nUh she was taxed at one time essentially a hundred and two percent of of\nSheet by the time they broke everything down to what she oh the whole nine yards and she was a she was a socialist if you will and she said oh oh no no no no no this is ridiculous and she actually wrote a thing called a ...\nIn ... near a or a ... in the world of money it was a satirical story about a wicked witch in which the wicked witch was being chased by the tax\n[noise] could you imagine that that you're working so hard\nAnd out of all of that work do you wind up with virtually nothing so the socialist started can play saying look this is counterproductive it's not going anywhere you've nationalized everything everything's going to hell in a hand basket what can we do finally the light went on\nBeating then reduced government's role they cut public spending\nPrivatize the national rail network abolished certain government monopolies eliminated inheritance taxes then sold state owned businesses like the maker of absolute vodka\nLower taxes and reformed the pension system so that he wasn't unsustainable the results from the spending cuts and privatization impoverished estimation developed one of the world's richest come [laughter]\nYeah they finally\nDevelop in one of the world's richest comes [noise]\nYeah they finally said okay we had enough\nGot take this the way this is a it's counterproductive right all these people want all this stuff\nAnd the problem is is it's just not working so let's let's let's privatize stuff a lot of stuff and we'll we'll we'll go free market and remember when I talk about somebody like a cause of your calls as well let's talk she's just she's an aberration for for ... she is she is an aberration\nAnd I'm going to say this is getting sex is horrible she kind of pretty people in front of the cameras and and they like to talk to her because they know she's going to say insane and inane things were last week she compared to global warming to Nazi is I'm In an all I mean she's going to say stuff this wacky do like she's great she's not she's not\nShe's young to get there maybe one day she'll have an awakening maybe she gets welcomed goes yeah a lot of stuff I was there back then was full of crap\nBut here's the thing people like Bernie was the guy who enjoyed Juba long before we got a little for the friendly with Cuba enjoyed the Soviet Union looked at their model wanted to\nUnderstand that like those kind of stuff wants government you'd be the center of everything and knowing full well that was still a capitalistic nation and even a lot of people in the left like it don't take away our capitalism wants to look at a situation where they can come in and not be Venezuela\nBy nationalizing everything but having the government be over everything is kind of their dream no\nSweet and for all intents and purposes and this is where the check comes in for everybody's gonna start sending me stuff\nHere's your here's your check right you can check your privilege right here how free are they\nAll I hear that sweetness the socialist paradise we do have a bigger well first faith in the U.S higher taxes on the west but in other areas or when it comes to free markets when it comes to competition when it comes to free trade Sweden is actually more free marketing fat free market pays for Sweden's big welfare programs\nThey are paid for and you go to Social Security [noise]\nFor Eighteen months pay rent movies government paid childcare for working families\nThey pay for a lot of those things right it does it pays for a lot of those things and those are the things we can discuss yeah no problem discussing some of those things you're not going to get Eighteen months off it's just not going to happen you know that I Know and and here's the thing\nIn a world where we are going a thousand miles an hour I don't think too many people want to stop down take a few months off their career that's that that's the reality some people do some people don't\nKnow what\nBut now it starts to get real so this is what they want to remember burning them they they they believe the government can do a better and if they can't make it a nationalistic thing where they take over some of these things they want to be able to control some of these things well guess what let's talk about some control how well the government doing sweet and when they kind of ran everything\nHaving the government manage all of these things were so we had to manage it in another they privatized\nWe realized in Sweden that with the government monopolies we don't get the innovation that we get when we have competitions and this is particularly true for the school system Sweden switched to a school voucher system that lets parents pick their kids' school and force the schools to compete\nSee this is one of the Bernie's or the world and everything this is where they're going to come out and they're going to want to pick and choose because the last thing they want to do is give schools that opportunity to compete with one another every state right now going to an election there's going to be on a majority of those some sort of school voucher fight or funding fight that\nRight now going to an election there's going to be on a majority of those some sort of school voucher fight or funding fight that's going on this is the name of their happening and\nAnd and while schools over their private schools are good guess what schools around private schools because of the competition had been forced to be better oh\nBernie didn't want any part of it if you tell a a socialist or progressive or even a hardcore Democrat that you want to school vouchers by and large most of not all of them but most of them will say\nUh no no now\nWhat about things like we get Social Security their pensions\nPrivatize the pension system that terrifies me and hopefully that scares people but when they realize that the alternative was that the whole ... system would collapse they hope that this is much better than nothing\nYes and their pension systems very interesting\nWhen things are going good you get your pension and potentially a little bit more when things are stopped down you're going to get a little bit less oh yeah yeah because people look at it and say well I'd rather have Seventy percent\nOf something that a hundred percent of nothing and the way that it was going it was going to completely collapse but for all of the on the left to scream and yell about how they're able to do all the things that they're able to do\nWhen it comes to taxes and the fair share of the whole nine yards I told you over and over yet you don't listen\nHow does the tax system work over there well guess what see\nWhat sweetened does may surprise you despite the fact to Sweden looks like sort of a socialist country which taxes rich exorbitant the high\nThe truth is the only\nPeople who weren't below average income pay up to sixty percent in taxes that the the little secret about the sweetest taxes than we don't take from the rich and give to the poor we squeeze the poor because they are loyal taxpayers boom\nIt's a Ponzi scheme amongst the middle class and the lower income\nThat's it the value added tax the twenty five percent tax that the the the huge taxes on all kinds of consumer goods\nThat allow them to pay for all of the things they don't go and tax the wealthy exorbitant leave because they know that their money makers and they generate and if you start to do that they saw that in the seventies what happens is they leave\nSo they had to find another way and this is the other way income tax low but the value added tax nationwide is massive and it disproportionately hurts the people the lap screams they want to help\n\nBut we could make the rich pay their fair share what's their fair share Everytime I see a new study it shows how much they pay towards federal income tax what is enough that's the thing stop telling me what their fair share is just once outlined it I Want them to pay this\nThere you go\nBut that's the look into what it is in the world of quote unquote the sweetest social model which isn't socialist at all three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and she always your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you\nSo it's
