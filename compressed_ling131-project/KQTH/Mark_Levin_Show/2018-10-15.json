I was just going back and forth yeah\nSo what ... did you pay off\nWe paid a ... like that I think of a Home Depot credit card mhm and I'm like this law I don't remember\nYou're with us Chuck is on the line and it's our job welcome to the Dave Ramsey\nDave thanks for taking my call sure once [laughter] well\nMy my wife and I have a pay down a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you and\nWhat we've only got about two hundred and Fifteen pounds ago because we have our mortgage oil three rental properties that we\nHave mortgages on and and those two and a half years we've had a fungal graduate high school he's in college we paying about half the today show he's taking out loans for the other half and I and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and see if I've got a beginner baby step save but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm\nDoing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand okay\nShow can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd I stopped the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental property as we in the past couple of years\nOkay if you um I mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into debt I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to here and the next few years ago yeah\nWell ... maybe some four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college which you are in our cash flowing in this case\nAnd on the Sixers payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is stupid\nIn an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our consumer that we should just save up a a but for three maybe four month emergency fund that then yeah\nAnd then I went there must stop taking off student loans and\nClear him out and then do the same with the other day and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we start throwing it at your\nEither your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounded like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn ... and then around your house mortgage must be small\nYeah it's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay a fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen\n... yeah yeah and for one is only one only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still on the take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make them out to work All right uh yeah still I'm just going to plink alone on those minimums\nAnd take her college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then among ...\nOnce when I first moved back in the oral okay or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now well okay yeah well no says you get your emergency fund\nRight yeah the emergency fund is maybe step three and then by bishop Forrest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there's money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages\nDutch is that there's so there's still a prioritization even though some of the news is that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skip it will treat for two and three I guess technically you're\nSkipping five or ... yeah yeah\nYeah and you and your skipped three to\nYeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're\nOn around the way we want you back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHigh ... it's an honor to talk to you how can I have a question for you okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now we listed it ends alive for two teams [noise] um I Know there is not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter]\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um what we're struggling with here we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that that a case and because it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm a realtor than that our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in a house in Harrisburg proper then no no I'm In like northeast ... you're up near New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes the\nDummy three or six to nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and you just have a limited market I don't know what to tell you other than\nA is there anyone in the resort area\nIf you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our military that just not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates their resort area\nThe higher and stuff\n[noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer\nYes on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter] so why are you moving\n[noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know that's a great kid you know well number four hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem when I got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll their workers or not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was I walked away they were not client's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\n'cause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours here on for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer wearing masks to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this\nIs a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes and that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses\nThat when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that can do that\nThis that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area and and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and that a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't want this area and they and they don't have a central Meyer stores you need it it's a very unique [noise] semi rural ... situation\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people about their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed\nAnd freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to find out really quake out unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... id theft plan to our benefit\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and simply wasn't that way on one of\nThose ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to Dave Ramsey [laughter] or on board and the beginning so I mean I'm\n... with your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the\nForte anyone would you like when I heard it was really difficult to to give up something that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get ... and and what do we want to show them and so we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with the legs that kind of stuff\nWith the income you've got no debt even do anything you wanted to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe and if you want I mean as you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so right man it's um you know you are your free up such still have incredible\nUh family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say yeah interesting very interesting\nSo um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um [noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off who were able to pay off the home that we live and mhm\nAnd so we we use the cash derived from that\nPlus cash flow and some savings to pay for our home that we live and\nOkay so it was just three property ... yeah that's what I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt which everyone operates okay ... ... worth what one point six wow you guys are amazing\nCongratulations well and obviously holding back then and clearing that that's a big part of the equation there yeah 'cause that's secured then amazing absolutely amazing\nSo you're sitting there with a net worth Whelan exposure to a million dollars now easily I'm the I'm guessing it for one case but with this income you got to be loading up so\nUm how Sheffield feels great I mean I'm

I might get that through collection of what you're getting out and then move out in dollars mhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlement from the male ... or less like I had a federal keen hundred dollar bill that there there are are\nFrom David take family hired for a friend of mine was telling me that that thousands of dollars that were given mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering how true\nThat is true definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for\nGays oh okay so what's your household income [noise]\nUm [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay so let's say let's say around ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal what's your yeah\nYour I have about two hundred dollars per thousand so that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but if in the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so yeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have in in addition to that now if you had a large return coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question\nThank you for joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money our question today comes from blinds dot com you do not need a second

only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but I had a lot of wealth in the background\nAnd I'm Sorry I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about but then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery has asked for me in my house we

not considering an focused on mine and my mother and first lady\nAnd I have much more important things to think about going to do\nYeah I like it I like it I think it's a very cool thing that she's willing to go out there and do something like that and talk about it and so it'll be very interesting to see how the world handle it because the world's been hammering her a\nIf we're just for the things just listen to this I Want to listen to ...\nSo this is the view right so you've got these uh these ladies here who are on the view and they're talking about her outfits this is the kind of thing or what she said she said she's one of those bully people in the world and everybody's like oh but listen to what these these these women are talking about when they're talking about an outfit in particular I\nCan we talk about this gigantic white ... sitting in the shot and it's really not going to say that represents a lot of stuff for fault [laughter] especially folks in Africa\nSo I brought this up as high as as many different elements that summer when this is her first election since I concentrate on what I say not what I wear but the problem is when you're wearing things like that which is very charge the symbol of British colonial around I just don't understand the fashions says\nWell that's it she's won a pet pet the ... what you see in a lot of those old movies when guys around ... look at me here I Am and its its colonialism it's\nAll of these things any such reach that they're sitting around talking about this first of all that's privilege right like we're all white privileges privileges that privilege that's insane secondly she look I don't think she was\nThinking about hey you know what if I put this on the shows power and it shows that I own these people\nGiven now I'm Wondering what the real problem Harris is when you don't do any homework about where you have you know when when when you think about some of the things that have been sent about Africa the kinds you know I met him pen pals ... says we own you\nKnow is that what it says I think what they're really saying is hey she looks like she's at a polo shoot 'cause that's what it looks like right\nLike what are those like like weird commercials that you would see Johnny Depp in in a beautiful woman in the Johnny Depp like\nHe's got his arm around that tiger and there's a woman off into silhouette she's got the hat on and like a a tie and she's got her jacket over it and she's got you know this look and it's in the silhouette in the sun's going down and he's like stinky it's what I wear or whatever that's what it looks like\nI don't think she's putting the helmet on going you know what\nThis is really just can make everybody uncomfortable I like it it's going to make everybody know that I own them I don't think that was it I think she's like hey this looks like something good to where\nThis is what it looks like this is what happens when people sit around all day to think about things to talk about and they're just they're they're doing on her when she said she told me the most bully people in the world people like oh that's a bunch of crap look at the privilege and the life you lead yeah she does doesn't mean the people on line people like this don't take shots at her every day\nI never did real Michelle a bomb and the kids I never once anything in fact one time oh people pissed off of me because I went off on a few of the or the middle eastern folk if you will when they had some harsh words to say about my first lady at the time was Michelle Obama and I was not happy\nAbout that three two three five three twenty four twenty three at your best in show is your Twitter\nSpeaking of the middle east what is going on with this journalist why you see so important\nWhere Izzie we're going to touch bases on that and it is a very interesting story to say the least ... [noise]\n\n[noise]\n... Benson show [noise]\n\nA good night's sleep is the foundation for good health not getting enough sleep can compound the facts of stress on the body not to mention lack of sleep contributes to premature aging in a way gate\nSleep is just as important as diet and exercise when I tried my pillow for the first time and started staying asleep longer and sleeping more deeply I knew I found a real solution to the sleep issues I'd been having like no more neck pain the differences real unique to experience it for yourself\nThey bought our stuff it is a weird thing that goes on there remember this is and people say well we can't not do this we have to do the steel people are texting me and I'm saying no no no\nI think we look at this I understand what Trump's trying to say he doesn't want to kill this deal because a lot of money pouring into us has a lot of jobs at a hundred billion dollars the people are getting depending on and saying that the oh this is a journalist who\nHad power and\nIf I'm Trump I look at this seriously really seriously what influence what was he working on what was happening that you would send potentially fair teen\nMen to take him out\nAnd by the way from\nMay really wants to steal but I Will tell you this Congress has a say on this and a ... yeah they're not thrilled and if anything's going to unite them for all of the stuff that's happening in our country it may be this thing\nBecause I think it's important to know what happened we've read the same clues everybody else towns obviously I'm probably some additional information which I kind of share we need to know what happened but ultimately I'm going to say this and I'm not saying this is what happened during the learn it soon enough\nThe Saudi Government ordered a guy to be abducted they killed them they chop them up the sound a bunch of people and the killing them chop them up and then they lost 'cause that's what happened [laughter] I'm telling you either the what's going to happen here on Capitol Hill is a complete revolt against our policies with Saudi Arabia I\nThink about that and they could override this they could override this it's a very ... and again the relationship we have them look at nine eleven look at several of the other issues that have gone on well hobby is them all of these kinds of things it is the you know it's one of those things where\n[noise] they hate it they hate Iran that that huge\nThey do their mortal enemies and that is a big issue so we walk a weird fine line and that we have for for years the oil all of that stuff it is a very fine issue we walk but that a hundred and ten billion dollars in a lot of people were looking at what is taking place in this kind of\nBizarre weird fight revolution that is going on in in in what is trying to become a more modern Saudi Arabia\nWhere they were the younger king who was forward looking women may be able to get you know drive and yes what they're getting license but there may be some more progressive things but then you've got a very hard line religious sect that doesn't want to move any any more forward than the sixth century that they're living in\nA so you've got all this weird things and this guy I mean this guy is a very ... very interesting character like say he he befriended\nOsama bin Laden and the eighties and into the early nineties and when he was fighting the Soviets and\nUh and and at times he was even trying to broker a deal of peace between Saudi Arabia and bin Laden he disavowed him after\nTwo thousand or one in nine eleven he just said he would would never have anything to do with him but he begged him to step away from all of this stuff this guy he's had a lot of influence there and the influence he has\nIn giving people the opportunity to have a voice\nEven if they don't say it's so much out loud to him and threw him was huge and now we're in a situation where you know people look around going what what is going to happen with is what's gonna happen with this relationship with us in Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's unfortunate because they're unimportant partner and our Middle Eastern strategy to contain sort of Iran and the various influence in the region\nA but but if they haven't gone as far as the lord of the sky into this consulate kill him kind of a body offering them Santa Cruz here to do that and then they laugh at they're responsible for not I'm not for an hour and find out what the evidence was presented\nBecause that's what happened that I'm telling you what's going to happen here on\nCapitol Hill as an effort to completely fundamentally altered the relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia yeah\nYeah that might actually happen and what did it take\nTook a journalist of all things Trump and the fighting and all this stuff Trump I think it's going to fight tooth and nail to try to keep the deal together talking about the influence talk about all these kinds of things that you know with this money what can they do and how do we need to keep them close\nBut I'm I'm On the opinion and they're going to go spend that money and it sucks the more you find out about this that originally I was like well we've got to see what this is all about but I mean I wouldn't want to give that up they're going to spend the money with Russia is going to go spend that money with with\nMore you find out about this and and what it entails the more you're like you know what if they are a part of this can have it\nI just hope for the show you'd say for his fiance for his family that's not what happened but I'm telling you of it is then there's going to be a complete and total revolt on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle about our relationship with the government so and it's an important relationship but I think but that cannot come we cannot walk alone without violence of in the face of something like this that's what's happened\nCenter Marco Rubio thanks for
