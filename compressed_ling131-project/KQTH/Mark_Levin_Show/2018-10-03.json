I'm about six months after my transition I still have not done that up until this point when I got a statement from um my current ambassador to the other day with my standing\nUm so now I'm at that point um my husband and I am baby step too and I'm not sure whether I should roll over the four oh one K. what she eats about ... broken up into almost thirds\nWith ... percent tax on a pre tax match um I'm not sure if I should roll it over or cash it out it's just shy of Ninety five hundred dollars and I don't know if I should put that towards baby steps to or\nJust roll it over and leave it until we get in a point of our baby steps to start investing again\n... retirement unless it's to own void bankruptcy or foreclosure cause you're going to get hit with your tax rate plus a ten percent penalty just probably by third of it would go to the government and that's borrow money at thirty three percent interest playoff pitcher bad idea\nRang that so that that that's what I Would do is I Would rural led to an IRA and just get with your smart roaster pro or whoever you use for your investment advice and knew a direct transfer roll over anytime you leave the company always take my money with me\nIn the form of doing a roll over to an IRA and the way of got control of it what it's invested in it it's it's convenient for me to get my hands on and if you don't have somebody to help you with that you clicked smart buster Dave Ramsey dot com you fill in your stuff it'll drop down the list of people in your area\nThat we recommend ... procedures and they'll help you out\nAnd he's with us in Columbus, Georgia Hi how are you\nHow good how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay um I Am contemplating going to a new job and my current I'm a nurse and that's his and um my current hospital offer to ensure held a life insurance policy\nThat I think it's about five hundred thousand um my new employer their life insurance policy they offer is only one hundred thousand and I can't get it um otherwise I have some bottom end his orders and\nI just I get denied or I'd have an outrageously\nExpensive policy and I just I'm trying to think outside the box that I'm not stuck in a job that I'm unhappy because of this one issue you know I don't know how\nYou're going to be making more at the other position\nIt'll be the same okay are we\nBetter I only have to drive ten minute instead of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place the new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they had some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\nI asked about that and they said the man I spoke with said that it's a bundle package and he doesn't believe that's the case mhm\nTime and I spoke with um our investor and he um he said he goes it goes by your credit for the well and he's about to manage bond account known\nAs ... [laughter] I ever heard of it I'm not gonna start buying\nThat's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you I'm mean you you need to build up a big pile of money called wealth and then you don't have to worry about life insurance and that's the general principle that you moved towards a mountain\nTo pay our house off and they don't have any that um\nAnd so you know as a matter and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm right if you're having up oil that your family's fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income then we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become self insured\nYour family's fine 'cause the point is is the family needs your income to live\nRight on to the extent that don't need that just to the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago I tried\nCalling ... calls end or insurance then the market has changed dramatically\nWell I got another diagnose it back in March that when I Lived a life insurance and this diagnosis it um they basically said you'd get denied but I haven't tried Vander\nTrying them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything to ask mhm let's talk about it and find out that I don't I think you may be right I mean if you know you probably found some ... research and probably not insure all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five hundred grand how old are you\nThirty eight\nAnd and uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can't there's different degrees of it and mine mild but I um when they hit record it kind of\nGone down by the actual fact you die and I am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nWell I don't know how you doing I'm In I'm In good health so I mean it could get worse but you know I mean that's how old are you thirty eight okay\nSo I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old would have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve and it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not going to worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income which you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you passed away I think your husband can struggle through\nYeah I think you know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy\nAnd they've got about three hundred thousand in retirement yeah and your house was praying for him so and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he going to be OK yeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing he works right hey we're here now so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job\nBecause the call Center for informational purposes and just double check your assumptions okay okay I Will thank you thank you Michael is with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood thanks thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nSo overall I'm trying to figure out whether or not to continue to build up my underfunded emergency trunk or to pay off my car so I can give you a little bit of a back story\nWe teach people who we call the baby steps\n...\nBaby after one is a thousand dollars already got anything above that goes on baby step to any other money goes on that anything except your home you lift your debt smallest largest you attack that with a vengeance how much do you own your car\nOr Eighteen\nAlso in how what's your household income [noise] sixty four fifty five other how fast you can pay off in Eighteen thousand dollar car\nPretty quick what's pretty quick uh well right now I'm just making the normal and\nSo fast to make sixty thousand are you going to pay Eighteen thousand do that math\nNine months yeah\nYou have no life you get the car paid off or you sell the car and moved down there too but you don't need to pay that much longer how old are you twenty four\nTwenty four and a\nAlmost like I've done this before [laughter] okay yeah so you got to really expensive car and it's kicking you and the tea so a payoff have the car I said oh my God it's a really expensive car was worse\nAh thirty and you make ... it was it was my graduation\nPresent myself yeah I'm also a resident to yourself not a president turning my Brazil do myself is I'm going to run my life you know no that's the other hand said okay let's get stupid thing paid off for let's get it let's get assault on that too so you got nine months to pay it off with a thousand dollars you got any money saved other than a thousand dollars\nA or curly what the company match up putting Fifteen to\nStop putting money in your four O. one K. and do you get this carpet off\nOkay and I'm putting three hundred dollars a month into an emergency fund\nStop doing that to see how much it I mean our emergency fund a approaching four thousand dollars to correct okay take three of it out but it only Eighteen you're down to one shop all savings\nAnd completely lenient completely focus and completely affected by this car if you are unwilling to do those things that means you need to sell this car [noise] this is the day branch from [noise]\n\nIf you're a business owner I Need you to listen up did you know that more than half of teens today associate stress and worry with money half\nAnd young adults are entering the workforce with no idea how money works that's not okay what if I told you your business could be known as the business making a direct impact on your community well it can\nThe arguing down on the on the after the ... after the weddings over there you\nKnow well I can think of a worst place to find a spouse I'll tell you that [laughter]\nThat is awesome guys well since you are experts in indoctrinated through and through what do you tell people when they ask how you get out of debt you played all of a hundred and fifty three thousand and twenty three months no matter where are you mad that's not easy\n[noise] well it's not I I think that they get fired with having a budget and having a plan together and they begin to that plant every month\n\nAnd a safer for me I think that you know I just feel that we're we're over the whale mingling blessed and the fact that um\nWhile before we get mad and I can look back of my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met and we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nUm we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as a couple and said that was dumb now we've got to fight back out of it you know\nYou're going to let all the way while you were single yeah absolutely [laughter]\nGood for you guys very very well done I Love it that is awesome it you're right that's a great story that's a great store gives me a whole new idea for a new product line [laughter]\nThere you go I think I think to one of the one the biggest thing for for us is that um we found out about eight months ago that we are going to be having our first\nChild yeah you know [noise] so uh we we had about two months to go getting out of debt and we just hammered down to finish this off and I know my personal story my father passed away or to\nA he was thirty six years old well our family and a pretty\nTight spot my mom a as such a hard worker hero the family um had many health problems which make money tough yeah so I get overwhelmed to think that our child will not ever know about that yeah well not ever know how that life is you know you know\nI'm sure you're I'm sure you euro seemed about term life insurance through with that\nI Know you go out and we were just listening to that [laughter] oh and the other thing for me is that when the Holy Spirit and not just you to do something and you don't have any debt you know what you do you do it to\nMoon no no I was talking about that the other day it's tough to serve two masters that's right and uh when you don't have another master in your life you only have one it's a lot easier not try on\nYou two very

I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nOr nothing like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\n\nI just being okay by it's not like you're getting the right great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever right this is I'm not sure if I'm\nLike to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back ran over\nWell where no one on the long term whether you want to own um\nWell my wife she we kinda do want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she's in school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got every angle\nArea it's like I say my wife great grandma's house she being here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country will part of Atlanta gotcha okay and how old are you to uh my wife\nShe turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a a one child you said and how much do you have\nA we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income\nI make about every year but I'm trying to also get in school but I had to kind of work with the first answer that was how much I\nDon't know what else\nUm I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month\nAnd your wife done more mhm okay that's pretty shy and that's where we've tried on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nAnd we just found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kind of you know trying to start it off a little better any\nGood good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court will get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah though\nWith all the with the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt you're gonna get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I because I also kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction and that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kinda is not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she\nYeah here's like other relatives staying there kind of beaten it up so I I mean I don't know if it's like maybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house or am I Lived\nThere unless you become the owner of it\nAnd and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now my son's name\nI Would be willing to walk away from this house some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo ah what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment is rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent and the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say a to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be in and I just got to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the heirs are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day this is not that many on 'em or that\nThey actually they know about it like I said we we may here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that if they are paying the oil I just keep paying it\nIn because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like nobody commanding me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they can take you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and them water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just going to walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before David Nadler some something you know in the night in a life a little head because\nLike whatever money whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is gone\nWhen you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court and get the deed transferred to your name\nAnd you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nThe place you kinda like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks written Atlanta is not a bad gig on two and a half acres\nSo I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nA smell hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\n... worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner than getting ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it\nMy guess is ill as probably fairly close on this if we thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative thought it was worth two hundred thousand\nOr a thousand their pocket when assault oh sharks would already been circling\nThey'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without away all you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess and there you can't\nGet cleaned title for this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean title because you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean titled\nJobs that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and you don't home not [noise] not any that's what you would do hope that helps man's thanks for calling in this is the Dave Ramsey shower\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not

for that and the money goes in there and they donate some out then they write it off it's all just to\nHave a flat tax say there is no more code here it is when there you go problem solved\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at\nUs so I [noise]\nI I find this to be interesting I said something last week about the fact that when you look at ... at all the thing that struck me most is it is for all intents and purposes\nIt's the John Hughes movies of the Nineteen eighties remember those pretty and paying some kind of wonderful all of those movies that were as it was a rich kid there was the poor kids was Molly Ringwald it was all of this stuff and lo and behold people talking about\nSixteen candles might be one of John here the seminal cinematic classic that that doesn't mean every aspect of the movie had aids go out in fact there are a lot of things in the movie that are more likely to make you cringe than laugh sure it was a product of the era\nThat some of the movie moments of cultural insensitivity are just plain hard to overlook upon a modern review\nAnd comment one year ago and now the code violet hurting the way they wanted to [noise]\nOkay so that's the retro rage modern sensitivity who's an average but that's what was that modern sensitivity\nModern sensitivity [noise]\nWe look at things now we we look at today's world and we think that everybody should have been as woke as we are today ten years ago Fifteen twenty thirty forty fifty years ago\nDoesn't work that way that's what ... ... ... that's like looking back when the first time we've crawled out of the ocean right and crawled on the land that you should be civil didn't woke us that's ridiculous we evolve not only physically we've all we've evolved mentally socially\nRight\nNot only does he gave her the cold shoulder just because of another girl has shown interest in him buddy even encouraging the desperate freshmen had to take her home because he's trying to death out on her way than predicts he'll be drawn to tell them apart anyway Jake early freshman so so what's the difference\nOh my God he's horrible guy horrible horrible chi can you believe that but this was understand to what they tried to point out it was just it was this weird\nWorld of of nerds and ... freshmen and yet there was former Ted and that was Anthony the whole there and and and you know it was the rich kids and the poor kids and how they came as\nAll of this stuff\nIt wasn't just socially it's horrible I remember the donor write it all the things I mean all this stuff that goes into these things\nAnd that's the thing I mean I look back and I think about all the movies now that can't be made that we look at and go oh producer Phil here's one Blazing Saddles could you do that today oh hell no hell no no chance\nI'm waiting for them to go you know we can't sleep we can't do this because every once in a while you'll see like in the summertime the like hey wait on Tuesday nights we both Classics We can't play these things anymore because of the cultural sensitivity today we're already changing things in colleges\nThey're changing Mark Twain's books and others were books we were getting rid of Laura ...\nIt was culturally is not sensitive to today's world and that is insane\nYou know I when I made those movies with John Hughes um his intention was to not make Porky's or Animal House and um but I think you know as everyone says and I do believe is true that the times\nWere different and what was acceptable than is definitely not acceptable now and nor should it have been then but that that sort of the way that it was\nYeah again yet Porky's I I don't know how many times I've seen Porky's other parties much Animal House one of my favorite movies of all time\nAbsolutely these movies were a little bit they they were definitely different it wasn't just teenage aunts there was all kinds of things that they were going through were the other ones were just anxious and it was craziness and it was wild was about the drinking and all this get revenge of the nerds is another one you look at that\nAnd that was another movie that I ... a lot of us watch them we liked\nDon't look at\nThe end retro rage back to back then you look at it you say that's what it was back\nThen obviously we've we're more will today we're more socially uh we've evolved in so many ways in ... that's like comedy it should be comedy is at the height of where comedy is in a way that it hasn't been for years and at the same time more and more people try to stifle it\nMore and more people trying to shut it down because they don't like what people said whether it's Dave Chappelle or Joe Rogan or Daniel Taj are a lot of these people that you know you go out there like ...\nThey just they don't care but they get destroyed for it right we can't do what we can do these things like we used to be able to do these things go and look at something like even a\nGuy was that movie a few years ago with a\nGuy where they got crazy in Vegas I'm trying to think what it was\nWhen I got lost their I forget my my mind's by drawing a blank but can you do that's ten years on\nRight Fifteen Years on its retro rage\nI feel very differently about the movies now and um\nAnd and it's a it's a difficult position for me to be in because there is a lot that I like about them um and of course I don't want to appear ungrateful to John Hughes but I Do a pose a lot of what is in those movies\nThat small remote well guess what you're famous because of those movies you're famous because of those movies\nAnd I'm sure if we look back I I watch shows all the time and I look at the way that that that the you know whether it's Archie Bunker or The Honeymooners or or gun smoke and the way that people talk to each other is a totally different world\nI get that but that's the way it was then leave\nYour modern sensibilities at home and just admire it for what it was at the time\nI Believe that there is still a lot of good and the sounds a and there's a lot that I'm proud of and I I feel like in a lot of ways they've they've touched teenagers and and sparked a conversation\nThat is important and having a a teenage daughter and myself I Know that it's not always easy to get teenagers to talk\nNo it's not because it's too busy playing on their damned phone's right that's what the movie would be today that wouldn't be any of that because you mean girls today comparatively oh can you a lot of the things that we look back on oh wow Heather's or a lot of these other things that it's just it's a different world\nIt really is\nThat's at the time the problem is people get separate that any more\nThey want it to be they want to move their modern sensibility if you will their inclusiveness they're all this stuff and they want to they want to move it back to there and say look how horrible you were on some kind of wonderful is one of my favorite movies of all time I love that movie\nI feel like the movies that I made than we're very much representing the culture at the time\nYou know and and I feel like that is why they resonated with people because it it was their experience and they did feel like they had these films that were that were real they weren't they didn't have that sort of after school special feeling where somebody was you know teaching them a lesson and you know it didn't it didn't feel like that\nNo no it wasn't it was interesting it was fun and it wasn't an after school special it was something more than that and I don't want people attacking my childhood\nSick and tired of it it was what it was that was the time in the era trust\nIn in fifty a hundred years are great great grandkids are going to look back at our kids and go wow they were not well 'cause we're woke\nFunny let it go three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter you can tweet at
