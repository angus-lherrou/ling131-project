[noise]\n\n\n... Benson show [noise]\n\nYou're hurting battle and they send you home with the battle doesn't then they're\nOh absolutely and and and you know as we talked to agree with you is the screenwriter ah\nThe author for the order of an ex series and and several comic books she would probably familiar with but he's out there helping the Democrats and ... and you're out there helping Democrats who are in in in races in places like Texas where you talked about a guy\nThat is you know a guy was what does he an Army Ranger shows the guy who who's ... he's built up a business\nHe is he was everything that you would look when you look at a Democrat you go like that to me is when I look at when I look a Democrat that the Democratic party I used to recognize just like on the right there is some people out there that I recognize that are that used to be the Republican Party the extremes have the bully pulpit\nAnd the problem is as we've now gotten to the point where we no longer look at the other side is somebody I disagree with a on political things we now just look you across the board is you're evil and your the enemy\nAbsolutely and the gentleman who you bring up is it is a great example to talk about this with names Joseph Kopser he's running into access\nA you know Twenty years in the army he was a ranger he then uh went to the Kennedy School at Harvard got a degree in international relations ... was a professor at West point I mean really impressive guy\nAnd one of the things that he did after that as he went and created a a clean energy\nCompany which was a huge success he now employs hundreds and hundreds of people in Texas but a really successful entrepreneur he understand small business and for instance when he talks about health care he doesn't talk about it in a way that shaming people who don't have the same view of him who who you know it's not from this perspective of\nHere's this sick child and how dare you not care about them because I think people who are conservative it's not that they lack empathy for people they're just trying to figure out a system\nOf here's this sick child and how dare you not care about them because I think people who are conservative it's not that they lack empathy for people they're just trying to figure out a system that that makes sense for them and feel sustainable economically and what's so great with cops are as viewers he's like look I had after Twenty years in the army\nI had a baseline health insurance for myself and that gave me the freedom to go take a leap to build this business which now created hundreds and hundreds of jobs and it's helping to drive the economy\nAnd it's a different perspective on it of trying to look at the robustness of the whole community and ways that we can have conversations about things like health care and look to different types of advantages\nOh absolutely you know it's like it's like when I talked to my friends who are like they're the climate climate change climate change I said you know you guys will approach is wrong you come at Republicans you called them deniers anybody who who doesn't agree with you because the reality is well science is out there then you can find a posing science and the fact that some of the numbers have been\nYou know you know dig dug up a little bit people get frustrated and think it's a bunch of bologna if you come at it from a\nHey you know what whether you believe in this science that science reality is going to take better care of the planet plus there is some money to be made here so there's a capitalism is a part of it\nWhy not become part of a of a solution here we don't do that anymore we can't have a conversation the same thing goes with the health care I Want to find a way to get I Would love to see everybody get healthcare can we can we use a combination of both what are the tradeoffs is Thomas Thomas ... say it's about trade off what trade offs can we have\nBecause at this point I look at the Republicans Democrats and they'd rather have a hundred percent of nothing than fifty percent of something\nLook you're preaching to the choir on this I mean especially with the environment I think the other thing that happens just to talk psychologically for a moment people have a an understandably defensive reaction when they are told that they that they are bad not that it's their views but when you switch it over to that\nAnd there's an underlying sort of negativity and environmental messaging here I'm not being party specific I'm just saying when we talk about the environment we tend to come from the sort of we're so we're not ideal that that man is bad in nature is all good and some people are like wait a minute if a beaver can build a dam\nLike why can't we build apartment complexes like what is this thing that everything that man does is is bad and evil\nAnd and there's this under current to it that people understandably so you know some people have a defensive reaction to and I think there is a really positive way\nFor us to look at this and go look we put a man on the moon right we we obliterated polio from the face of the planet we got rid of the ozone hole and not a single business not a single business went out of business\nBecause we got rid of certain types of aerosols like this is something we know how to do we know how to be respectful of of the environment we knew how to not you know regulate businesses to the point that they're choked off and die and we also know how to solve problems around the planet so let's actually talk about that\nInstead of just rolling recriminations at each other and telling people that man is bad and anyone who opposes this is is in denial there there's ways to have steps towards solutions and look I Will say with the with the intellectual dark Web overlap with Jordan the time he was my thesis adviser as an undergrad and we go back forever\nBut you know one of the things that we sat around a little bit I mean I had a really helpful conversation with Ben Shapiro who I Would say is is is as opposed to me on most issues\nUh you know and and basically I was looking at a certain proposal and just called them up and was like hey what do you hate about this like tell me all the the issue that you have with us we had a super civil reasonable conversation I came out of it not having massively changed my mind on it but understanding the weaknesses\nYeah the super civil reasonable conversation I came out of it not having massively changed my mind on it but understanding the weaknesses\nAnd I made a tweak to a policy proposal in keeping with some of the concerns that he raised so it's it's not like it's something where it caused me to go oh you know I I completely believe now like let's let's get rid of you know the smaller the government the batter the best form a government is when you can drown in a bath tub I mean it wasn't like it was some huge reversal\nBut we helpful if there was a libertarian\nSort of concern that with that I was aware of but that he really reinforced vehemently that helped me come back and make a couple of small adjustments to the things that I was proposing that respect that and I think we tend to undervalue\nIncremental change you know we tend to undervalue talking come up with solutions and one of the things I always say is there is a lot of really smart conservative out there I'd love to have us all pretending not pretending I Would love to have us all actually working on solutions to make use of all these brains to say hey\nHere's what I think is really important for a baseline of health care in this country and for them to say here's all the problems with that and for us to say how do we solve that how do we get here\nYou know how do we get here without causing damage to small businesses and really sit down and be able to utilize brains in a brainstorming away from all sides of the table that's really what the intellectual dark webs about\nAbsolutely talking to a greater which is of course the author of the orphan accident and many comic books that you guys might recognize that never was talking about him\nSaving the Democrats and just having corals real conversations and again it's the trade off I was joking with my friend last night I said if the Republicans and Democrats each won the lottery the other night because the other side would be getting some of it neither of them would want it and it's just some game and the fact is it has to be trade off\nWe can find a way both capitalistic ally\nIn it to help healthcare and to get due to to do things and it may be if there is some government intervention or governments brought in some way shape or form\nThat we can figure out a way to protect children adults people who are vulnerable we can do that the problem is I ... both sides wanted their way or no way and that\nTo me is ridiculous I'd rather have seven Seventy percent of something Greg than a hundred percent of nothing why is it ... that we've got to the point here is it is it only big money and the donors that are out there\nOr is there other things that people are afraid of because this this six percent on either side the bully pulpit screaming you know social justice warrior lunatics\nHave been able to do many ways hijack part of the party and a lot of I think politicians are afraid of\nYeah I think that that that's not inaccurate I mean I Would say that one of the other problems that we have that we don't always look at as ... as as clearly as this is I think social media plays a big part of it and I think whatever side of the equation that you're on\nHum what we've gotten is is a virtual arena where people spend more time socializing than in the real world and they can unlike anyone who disagrees with them and they're creating a bubble of people who largely um\nAgree with what they think hum and and basically what it becomes a sort of the virtues signaling Olympics right like the more vehemently you can be opposed to something that is racist the more vehemently you can only left asked\nThe more clicks you get the more benefit that you get the more followers that you get and it's reinforced constantly in a direction that propelling us opposite sides\nSo one thing that's really important to me is I follow a ton of people across the spectrum there is a big issue in Hollywood here because somebody said that we should follow bench appear to see what he thinks and a bunch of people from the left kind of blew up over and it's like how would you not like how do you not want to\nSuperior to see what he thinks and a bunch of people from the ... kind of blew up over and it's like how would you not like how do you not want to follow people you disagree with\nA and know what they're up to and you know a lot of my friends really span the gamut I've a lot of friends who are conservative a lot of friends who were Wall Street\nRepublicans I've some friends who are kind of you know ... Trump voters a lot of libertarians and when you do that what you start to get which is which is to advantage both strategically I think and morally\nAs you start getting ear for all the things that really turn people off what what are the buzz words that make people shut off and retreat into their their in group favoritism let's call it\nAnd we want to know how to avoid that not just to make effective messaging and not just to when we want to also understand that so we can figure out how to talk to each other better\nAnd people aren't doing that you know people you go on you go on social media and you look at what's happening and people are really competing and doing like they're doing dog tracks for their followers and and the more that you are polarizing the more benefit and

interesting and one of the big things that you know it it it's tradeoffs remember it's not going to everybody but some of the things that they're talking about is a way that something that I've been screaming about when it comes to opiate addiction\nIs how do we treat it from jump meaning we need to find new ways to manage pain from the beginning\nBut because we live in a world of instantaneous

children were not accredited schools in dangerous neighborhoods where academic achievement is often ridiculed the answer to the problem for education in school choice\nEffects that we have coming and the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being spoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real there's always been enemies\nDoing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time but it used to require a prostitute and honey trapping effect business partner in a bribery scheme and more\nYeah well we still have those right but that just like somebody's going oh gee on those kinds of things like that super oh gee but the things they can do now are incredible and\nAnd and ... it is nuts and\nBy the way it can be somebody sitting somewhere in a cave with a satellite link up\nAnd the opportunity connect to the Web and have all the tools in the world they need at their disposal to make something look real that's the thing\nNow we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real it and make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad\nAt it the real reason we need to take the Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and those U.S officials and the public at large\nYeah yeah but also here in America because for every one\nOf those people that are trying to do something you've got ten people here in America that are doing the same thing\nFor their side I mean look at\nAll the PACs all the dark money that's out there looking all the ads that you see day in and day out you're inundated with stuff and all this dark money paid for by that blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and that's for all intents and purposes that's just the ... it'll legalize version of trolling people\nWe have so many internal divisions\nAbout geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided that we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the first Seventy two hours after that flamed the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides\nAnd then I like that kind of football should just be funny it's crazy it really is and it's frustrating\nThat's always telling me like other people I don't know how many I get probably Fifteen to twenty people who I Am me something they saw today right so here's some thing look at this what do you think of this and I'll say look at the source\nIf you're really serious about it if you really want information it's not the beauty of of all of these things these tricks jurors and the technology is the other side of it is you can find out how real some of these things are\nI mean we talked yesterday about the whole George Soros thing I got sent so many of these this is George Soros than a Nazi uniforms like no it's not it's not even close what people want to buy into because a lot of times people don't care they just want affirmation to their belief\nSo it makes it easy to spread these things when nobody really cares if the story is true as long as it backs up their belief system and that's scarier to me and a lot of ways\nNobody really cares if the story is true as long as it backs up their belief system and that scarier to me and a lot of ways\nWe're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video well up here and it will be having a party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now\nIt's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today\nAnd and for all of that stuff though like I say\nIf you're serious about finding the truth that about something you can do that\nBut in the world that we live in for all of these technology advancements that are great that people will use to do bad things or to try to divide us a good portion of people trying to divide us our own selves\nAnd the other side of it is we let them because we don't want to think anything other than the things that we want to think we want our affirmation not our information\nSo we will just go to that and say it has to be true I Want it to be true so if I go to look for it and I find out it's not true that is going against my own belief system I wouldn't want to go against my own belief system so part of it is our fault\nAgain enough responsibility to go around not personal responsibility\nNot blame to go round and enough hate to go around all of those things are unlimited in scope\nAnd uh but ... we have an abundance of we're growing them everywhere personal responsibility affirmation information all of this stuff we can all go grab which which one do you want to put in your little shopping basket well take personal responsibility you don't take some of that\nOr is it yeah I'll take some blame too yeah but I also want some affirmation\nMm I'll take a little bit of information but not too much information I mean if something's really insane like George Soros is the vampire I won't buy it but George ... being a Nazi maybe I'll take a little bit more information affirmation they're rather that kind of information because I Want to believe it\nThere's actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\nYeah and you know what I Want to say this year you know what else is the big issue\nGoogle huge issue\nGoogle's massive do you know that there's what two hundred fifty thousand engineers working at Google they dwarf China and Russia put together and the amount of engineering that's going on\nSome of the things that they want to do some of the things that they want to try some of the things that they're able to do with speech and the way that they go about doing it\nIs scary to it is very interesting\nBut yeah these are security issues that we need to be aware of but part of that I also looked at the people and I say\nPart of this is your own personal responsibility just because somebody tells you something or shows you or me or you read it somewhere doesn't mean it's true if you're honest about trying to find into yourself\nAnd saying I I I'm honest about my belief system I Want to find out if this is true or not you'll do the footwork to find out it's true\nBut our personal responsibility for many of us out there it ends once we see something that that ... that we go oh well I I Believe that to be true so I'll take it at face value\nIn part\nIs that we go oh well I I Believe that to be true so I'll take it at face value\nAnd part of that's on us\nAnd you wonder why the people worry about the nanny state well ... for a lot of people out there for me wrong that you're not an idiot\nMany of you you guys get it you're willing to go the extra step there's a lot of people out there that aren't three two three five

bring out our military is going to be a big episode in American history if things keep going the way they are going and the Democrats they love it because they're the party of chaos and conflict and and if you're not American there on your side of your American they're pretty much not on your side\nYou vote for them they'll tell you that they're on your side but they're lying to you or the president of Guatemala it was a guy named Jimmy was named Jimmy hey Jimmy how what's happening what's going on in Guatemala brother Jimmy Morales says the president of ... and the president of Guatemala last Thursday\nSaid that his security forces have captured almost one hundred ISIS terrorists in Guatemala that's what he said\nPresident said it's been a stretcher and had captured quote close to one hundred people completely linked to terrorist issues with ISIS and that not only have we arrested them within our territory\nBut they have been deported to their countries of origin and Guatemala they'll deport dressed in a heartbeat [laughter]\nSo should we have the same immigration policies that Guatemala I have I think perhaps we should President Trump so he's in prison Trump also mentioned I'm a possible is one of those elements and all the Democrats don't care that's ... ... what do they care President Trump\nSome bad people in that group you know you see the people come up

all in favor of all of that I really am I genuinely and sincerely am I my my building I live in a building in Washington DC I live in Washington DC and I live in a building or Washington DC in my building is like the United nations\nThat are ... eleven languages spoken on my elevator over the weekend\nA with me in it at a in my building and my neighborhood forget about it and and uh and that's great I think that's wonderful\nBut we have immigration laws wherever system for immigration and it isn't let's get thousands of people with foreign flags in March up and we have a list of demands because that's not going to work\nYou know we might have to let the Democrats loose on 'em with fire hoses and dogs\nAre they they they don't do that anymore or they just do that when somebody wants to exercise their right to free speech things like that Fox News center reporter William ... ness down to the border between may ... Honduras has\nThe highest murder rate in the world Honduras has the highest homicide rate in the world outside the door\nHas the fourth highest murder rate in the world go off My Lai has the idea that kind of like ... um has the fifth highest homicide rate in the world you should probably um work on that\nShould see what you can do about that to decrease the homicide rate just in Tallahassee also you know Gillum is his name right the Democrat running for a Senate in or for governor rather in uh in Florida\nAnd um hid under his watch under his two tillage under his leadership\nTallahassee now has a the highest murder rates\nIn the states and they've they've shattered the record for for Tallahassee um and and I guess that's a point of pride or something I'm ... but\nIf you're a Democrat it's not really a big story or I suppose because\nYou get promoted it's like round the manual it's like broccoli ... Obama organized the south side of Chicago good job there and I was elected to the Senate from the state house the U.S Senate from the state house in Illinois and then the president the United states because he's fixed the south side of Chicago which is like\nAleppo right what's Aleppo or let's go to William ...\nDone along the border and um it is true though this Gillum guy at the the the homicide rate in Tallahassee has shattered all records and that's not even something that reflects on him at all\n... why would that be a problem\nIf you're a Democrat it's really not a problem All right let's go because ah William washing us with Fox News yesterday I was watching this live yesterday afternoon and William ... was speaking to one of the organizers of the caravan [noise] his name\nHe said was Luis and Louis was wearing a vast like he's a crossing guard you know as with the reflective orange\nStuff on the vest and\nWilliam washing us bugged him because he was at a designated as a spokesman\nAnd the vest and William washing us bugged him because he was at a designated as a spokesman and one of the organizers of the thing\nAnd I said what you know when these people get to the United states what what did these people want why are they fleeing their homes in Central America what are these people going to say when they get the United\nStates they probably will have something I don't know they were probably as they they get in something they can stay on the United states will they can't they can't go to school so they can apartment and they can go to work\nSo they can get but their their kids aren't with them so they want to bring their kids and after they get here 'cause it's mostly adult men\nThat are that are coming in but I didn't hear him say anything about a living in fear\nAbout uh the crime the gangs the their cartels I didn't hear anything about that it probably has to give them something so they can have stuff so they can stay so they can get an apartment so they can get a job so their kids can go to school\nYeah\nAll right well okay I understand that I genuinely do I understand that\nAnd for that we have something that we call the immigration system and you go to the embassy in your country and you apply and you know now let me let me ask you this so many half wedded live out their let's say somebody gets on an airplane in Aleppo\nFlies to Cairo and then flies to London and then flies to New York and gets off the plane and says I'm here to stay I Want to live here I I I got on a plane and I came to the United states because now I'm here and I'm not leaving\nIs that how our immigration system works is that our immigration system should work is that how the immigration system of any country works or should work\nThe answer is obviously know Luis\nWas asked by William large enough they said well look the president said he's going to ah\nHe's going to shut down the border as you\nBring this caravan up toward the United states the president said he may call it the military and he's going to shut down the border but listen Louis knows she paid attention last time around the Democrats ginned up that whole fake news story completely fake huge lie that's like the red solo cups story\nThat Trump\nBecause of a zero tolerance policy in a part of that was true separating families like never before none of that was true Obama separated them all the pictures that they use word from the Obama administration\nBut listen Louis learn and then because of the media slash Democrat but I repeat myself pressure\nOr the president was forced to basically let the caravan and they were processed\nThey were let loose in the country catch and release because the Democrats were and their allies and the media were able to manipulate public opinion with fake pictures they're real pictures but they were from Obama putting children and cages then Obama literally did turn people over to caregivers\nSome of whom used them as slave labor including sex slave\nLabor children handed over by Obama personally\nJust getting it wasn't personally but it was his administration\nIf it were Trump handing kids over to people that use them as slaves on a chicken ranch in Ohio which is what happened during Obama with kids living in a in a chicken shack with a bucket as a bathroom because the Obama people handed him over to the flavors and there are literally\nYou know in a chicken shack with a bucket as a bathroom because the Obama people handed him over to the flavors and there are literally slave labor\nIn Ohio the children that were handed over by Obama and that story just got nothing\nNothing because I don't care about children and don't care about human life they don't care about slavery in our care about the sexual abuse of children and their documented cases of the Obama people handing children over\nTo people who are not their guardians who then uh the cereal a sexually abused them but you know let's not get all caught up in that show Louis was watching the news and he knows last time around President Trump said he wasn't going to let them in but then they got him so what did Lewis said yesterday that\nI found a lot less time and we we take over there but he opened the border for them all and then people will say voter Neal radio in the United states", "year": "2018",
