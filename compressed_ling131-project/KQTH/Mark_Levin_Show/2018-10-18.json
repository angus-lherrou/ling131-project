know even touch or pay off its loans dynamic of the off the credit cards but it'll take a few months for that to happen\nYou know um yeah so I'm a mom I have I have a six year old son Don ... well they came from um when I went to Harvard law school and so um I\n... I'm Sorry did you complete pharmacy school\nI didn't come to me I like all this happened last year um I hadn't got and I had gotten to the program because I had a serious I mean like I said I kinda

helping them and that kind of like you don't mess with the times that I had to study for for my my my um studies and it was wrong\nTravis is in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Travis welcome to that I rent them Hey David how you doing taking my\n... ... you could uh settle the debate for my wife and I thought a loophole or\nFuture um we have about Seventy five thousand dollar the debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is in case than at Seventy five thousand probably make a decent money and we have an Iran\nThat had about two hundred and ... and it sort of equipment on one what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo that the question that I that I have a good faith that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an inheritance in here and she had to take a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inheritance money I'm is who you\nTake one lump sum\nPay off all of our debt and then to repay ourselves back off of that to an IRA I'm so that we don't have to worry about including sleep paying the uh interest game if you will her a worry about that is that she um you know she is going to be coming that aren't good for that for our retirement\nUm my report could at is is she already I'm thirty eight we still have a good amount of time to be putting into our\nUm different calming count so I guess my my question is should we go ahead and take the distribution help all of our debt that we're no longer paying the um you know the interest rate or should we go ahead it pay that debt down as we are\nAre they will be there for in the winter you and a half years well\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to wealth what is the shortest distance to wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what gives gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing in mind that it's not all that in mind that it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process\nThat process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years and many many people have become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process and if your is it so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that won't answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process was called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one year most powerful wealth building tool\nIs your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk\nNot only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically freeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and uh and the second part of the things driving the process is is the personal finance is eighty\nMake money with instead of giving it to banks and uh and the second part of the things are driving the process is is the personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent have knowledge the stuff we're talking about snow really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is so having said that we say baby step one save a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that too is to be dead free everything but your house you've not done that\nThree is to have an emergency fond of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then force you don't have that for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about who fiber so in our savings account\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach you to do that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it to that and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was ... or ...\nOr a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a knife in your life wait a minute or no on him right probably the majority of\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know twenty five dollars and that\n... ... ... you know\nYou guys make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do it the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that you take all those payments that you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you have a paid for home\nCorrect we we heard it when it\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hunger go somewhere north of ... Seventy five\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct\nOkay and why she taking distribution says they'll just taking it\nUm ... we want her financial grant or told her that she had to get a good uh this debate to I'm a cover her at a over the fear that hit hard over at the most part because the way the quick money out of town\nYeah it's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making your decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\n... what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm getting a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt\nAnd I would invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see control and know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do\nBut that's what I Would do um because I think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen there's a lot of opinions flying around here\nAnd you guys have got to get inside this and to as a couple of decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do instead of them telling you what to do and it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor\nTo I don't think you picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine as well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even ... dead\nThey need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even though rebels dead and that's the way their stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my debts and invest the money\nWas watch less that's what I Would do and that would take your wonderful two hundred thousand or income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a\nCopy of the book the total money make over at a walk you through not only what to do but why do it and then you can decide intentionally whether you're going to use our system or someone else's doesn't matter to me [noise] Oscar's whether it's in Chicago hey Oscar welcome to the Dave Ramsey

everything that\nWe do we get older but I Know I have a partnership\nUniversity ... because you don't like to I can do in order but I'm just a ... point through my doing everything you're saying about doubling so the question today is\nCut off all my credit card um I can say that I called the credit card company to actually\nMove those count totally out of my main that we just all I Want to remove become patient abusing if you've got a right way\nOr absolutely absolutely and to be close the account completely not just cut them up and that'll keep them from reporting activity on your credit bureau report and it'll keep someone from accidentally fraudulently use using them or are you\nFrom using them down I definitely would close the accounts as soon as I cut up the cards\nNo doubt about it and talk to you Oscar monitor heavy as a new listener hold on I'll send you a copy of the book the total money make over and that'll get you started and give you the\nThe framework from all these

from Laurie in Iowa I was interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the severity of or autism\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens is the money to five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and ... it'll be taxed and heavily penalize\nSo um you know the five\nNine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and on where you get a special needs situation like this\nI'll bet you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and on and we've got a special needs situation like this I Would use the ... um and or\nI Would just use mutual fund just bored and mutual fund\nAnd let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money you're just you're marking it for them for their future or they may do a trade school they may do uh uh they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em\nThey may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing but you simply going to save money it's that simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to the only advantage of the table or the five twenty on it's just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual fund\nLike Washington says at our as it grows is going to be taxed\nThat's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving it in a mutual fund if you want to use the ... that's fine that's what it's designed for you all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it where I can get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push of our twenty nine just those two things uh ... in a traditional such a situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefits but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child you know\nIt just in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do um so we're letting it grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the\nPension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you'd just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work out open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter David I'm thinking about studying abroad next summer but the cost is at least five thousand dollars I really don't want to go into that\nUm but I'll be out of college soon and this was a once in a lifetime opportunity what should I Do\nIs that there is a hundred percent chance of Dave Ramsey is never going to tell you to borrow money\nFairly predictable I'm Thirty years\nI've been doing this almost under twenty seven years I've been here and there I've never told people more money\n... if you want to go study Rob I suggest you get your motive job five thousand dollars to do just work your little tail off\nAnd then go and enjoy your study abroad experience and pay cash for it and that way and we'll follow your home\nThere was a point um be amazed what you can do if you really really want to like for instance if I told you that you were going to die if you didn't say five thousand dollar\nHome do you do work to find out as long as the not die it's amazing what you can do when you really want to but I'm going to be a little lazy here and I'm just gonna borrow my way into a mess and I'm going to say well you gotta live oh you've got\nA no no this is like a shot [noise] oldest child no

U.

life like retirement and I'm Wondering I'm would be a good idea on how to invest that extra money I have to put my house in Middle East now you know that's a\nGood good question how old are you a fifty four fifty for you're single\nOkay and how many years do you think before you buy a house [noise] um I'm thinking at least sixteen\nOkay All right go well as long as you've got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would your shoes and that's in the index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I've started to a group of ... five hundred fund an index fund and use that to grow for the next five ten years or so and do you buy a house\nAs long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things\nI don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a a nurse and that that is I'm Wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nI'm so my question is if they work for me to go to school now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year and um so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a what do you make a year now uh right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years of ... three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than on the out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school um but I don't think I can catch anything right now because I I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nA or putting and Lisa putting a down payment for a house next year before I started school so\nThat then you need to wait until you can pay for school or whatever but you never in Thirty years of doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow it um I can see it pretty easily ... how long does it take to go through the glass again or go to guy ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nOr thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand you\nCan't cash flow thirty granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA love note when I'm not in coal\nNo if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... thirty thousand a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year I thought you said it was Ninety thousand [noise] ah sorry I got that wrong it's it's the sixty thousand a year\nSeems high yeah it it it is a it it is an expensive program yeah go to a less expensive program so that but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it\nFigure out a way to pay for it if I usually go you don't actually have it all starts stacked up ahead of time but you've got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether they finish or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mess and so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens dude and the last thing you want the only time debt works as if everything works other than that that doesn't work and so we\nSomething like that my life happens dude and the last thing you want the only time debt works is if everything works other than that that doesn't work and so we tell you
