Andy and Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nBy 'cause we're in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but things were going by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nThe camp will be a uh the the operations\nOf the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... own all and we'll be rented or on we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk\nAbout what kind of a you know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then for a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that\nWho are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the turn of the good show the the nonprofit or you either one and show\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property or they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance\nOn the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an ... interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a infiltrate the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liabilities right with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get confidence insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords ... you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but interest\nAnd walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that right airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash wrote what happened in the same kind of thing here they\nWould find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs so much in this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\nBecause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements a carry any weight in any of this\nUm no I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm the\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless\nYou you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building if you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hall Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk\nI but I hold harmless is that what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean ... they may not lose as easily but\nDie you're not ... they're not liable they're still wobble [laughter]\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't have a thanks for the call euthanasia you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your

what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new national I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on our why\nI'm so I'm new to the baby fat and I know that number one fan the thousand dollar emergency find my question is do you ever think gas saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering am how do you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years I enter never happened to act we really lucky we've never been laid off you go in and they get home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something ... going to work\nOn something when he comes home if he did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws all want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checkout one dental dot com it's not\nAnd I do that first and a Roth IRA and then I Do it in a ... T S P after that\nIf they're matching I don't think they do but if they're matching on the ... going to start there with her off with a match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country buddy we appreciate is going to talk to you Martin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey what is that while I was\nA one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary rap for them or in path any other dead also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the life that would say three or four months\nOkay so you're dead free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars I'm fifty thousand on bald each\nTotal on both total okay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty\nOkay you gotta lotta car and um so what do you own your primary and what are you oh on the rental\nMy primary goal to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nAnd the rental and now my my rental Ohio one fix the end is worth about I Would say or thirty a fellow at work they be but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right [noise]\nSo on you know if we state taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars\nAnd so on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know when you start doing what forty fifty grand a year at that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um Oregon shoulder rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and pay off more to pretty much tell the rent on pay off pretty much all my that yeah the ... but I also have in mind that for that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in three years she's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can catch while they're right okay\nYou know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check that out there next time you get hit by a car\nYou pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the planet you can to get on track yeah you can't sort or ride this out a dead horse it doesn't work you can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college and I would say about ... some other rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental on pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want to just do it in a savings account the should junior college junior soldiers still within their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the soil that rental I Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call man we're pretty sure you're joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money it's a free called the phone number is triple

show right now on what oh for a long chain you\nTo Dave Ramsey show\nJoanna is with us in Los Angeles are Joanne welcome to show how come I don't\nThink that taking my call Cher what's up [noise] um\nSo we're currently on maybe one on and we've been on a plan for a month and I'm David ... to ... we're in the process of getting a life insurance um evidence to last a\nMap and a summer that his dad took out if they had a full term policy on him when he was younger and he wants to eventually take that over and make those\nPayments um I don't know what that is um but we have four kids I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do it if I'm not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a trial yeah good\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's close to half a million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay\nBecause her whole life insurance policy ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my main cooker it and I found out the beneficiary and I don't I mean he's a great guy so I'm not worried about you know that it's\nOn my own director guy doesn't matter at a good guy the ... it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family\nParents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very ... and like going on you know wild blind\nBut it's strange yeah how long have you been married for a long you been married five years you know and then five years they've not address this issue that strength the strength you know it really I mean they should you should address the issue and\nThey should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term\nTo create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money so our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and my dad's a I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now\nI Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to pay something that you know and then it cuts but you have like I said\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I have a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings comes as a thing called a pension from my company [laughter] and that overall is about eight percent of my total as sad or\n... or ...\nWell it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a projected retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total have had you know and\nAnd my question is whether the cat has a lump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you get that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\n[laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred\nWell that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I did [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but Mm uh\nIt's still love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you down the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent\nBut low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal and so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Bijan lumps arms enroll them die of race and invest them and good roast mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nUh yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total network to assets house and so forth\nYou know Well Don ... congratulations how old are ya I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire one for that but before that happened\nA millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nAre sightings patterns or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell by twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means live they bought a modest lifestyle which ah we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things I think if you can limit\nStupid thing to do along the way that's good I like that it\nMay cause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things begin you can minimize those new things along the way\nIn a way of a modest lifestyle live below you mean I'm no void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if he's listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize those stupid yeah\nMaybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple and the math on that works to your benefit a at a wall of live if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor sure you come out three hundred grand ahead [noise]\nAlive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand I had a\nQuestion about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there it's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire [noise]\nOh I Love this millionaire subject to this show in wreaking\nYou're going to be hearing more from Ramsey solutions on that promise [laughter]\nI promise [laughter] this is the day

the go it it it's not they don't see it and it's not life threatening are you going to do it while every year\nYeah okay so now I don't know so they look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is that it's an air tanker commissioned the Packers are unsure of where it comes time okay so if there was a ... year but I Do is I'm sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced God help you that you have with this the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a\nYou know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing frantic medical and just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally like penny
