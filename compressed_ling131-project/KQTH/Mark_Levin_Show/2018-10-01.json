AAA eight to five ... five two to five\nMitch is with us in Kansas City welcome to the day Ramsey show Mitch\nHi Dave how are you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise] well they have um I got a question for you about a whole life insurance policy [noise]\nMy wife has a whole life insurance policy that her parents got her you know twenty some years ago and they don't hang it and now they're transferring ownership over to us\nOr we're wondering if that would be a wise thing to maybe cash that out yes or [laughter] okay I'm wearing baby step too so I didn't know it it'd be why the cat out orders to let it grow no\nIt's not growing but about one percent a year one point two percent as the average cash value gross\nAnd ... so it's sucks as an investment of success and insurance product\nSo are you you should get I uh ten to twelve times a year income on you tend to twelve times her income on her in term life insurance Fifteen to twenty or level term and then cash this stuff out and use the cash value towards your baby step too\nOften um we already have that term life insurance in place for both of us so good caution harms our income yeah I mean there's ... and it would be it would take about their care of the rest of our debt which is about Thirteen thousand in the cash value right now about Seventeen great every taxes with it\nNo probably not the basis in your whole life policy for tax purposes calculation is your basis numbers as if what you paid for it is the total but her parents paid in over\nPolicy for tax purposes calculation is your ... as if what you paid for it is the total that her parents paid in over all those years which is probably a whole lot more than a Seventeen\nThousand oh okay\nAnd yeah it was as long as that's the case there is no gain now if they paid in Fifteen thousand if a total of all the premiums they ever paid was Fifteen thousand and you pull out Seventeen the game would be two thousand\nGotcha okay um\nIs actually be ordinary income is not again because it's not actually an investment\nSo are but um yeah Ninety eight percent of all life policy particularly these horrible childhood policies like this when I Do not you don't even get back what you put in it that's how bad the rate of return is you see what I'm saying if that had been the actual fun it'd be a hundred thousand ...\n\nHonor\nHow are you [laughter] I'm good how are you days better than I deserve what's up\nA satellite question was um how much do you think young people say Eighteen to twenty three shed um\nPrioritize investing and starting early relative to kind of piling cash for a first time\nUm I think you can do both um there there's no rush to buy their first home I'm generally speaking from Eighteen to twenty five there's a lot of transition in your life or there's a lot of moving around\nUh things that happened new jobs a finishing are going to college possibly getting married a lotta stuff happens in that Eighteen to twenty five range\nAnd so yeah and every one of those things may precipitate living in a different place\nAnd so like if you bought a house at Eighteen and let's just get you know I don't know your situation but let's just pretend you then uh or or at Nineteen and then you\nFinished college and got married there is a real high percentage chance that house and cutting it you're moving somewhere else\nSo you probably should have just rent it during that time uh and piled up cash so it's not a rushed into things kind of subtle out in your life and you know what the groove is now you can settle in the group at Eighteen that's fine you say I graduated I Know what I'm doing this is what I'm doing and\nThere's not going to be any big changes going forward um then that's fine\nBut um you know a ... if you are in college one hundred percent I Want you to focus on college not on saving for a house and not on by investing because the best right of return is education assuming you're studying something that's usable in the marketplace\nI'm not getting a degree and left handed puppetry or something like that\nSo but yeah that's the best return 'cause you make more money on that than you do on a mutual fund or on purchasing a house and so but it all depends on your situation is more stable and predictable the less transition that is in your future\nThe more you would lean towards may be buying a house but I'm just not in a hurry there I Love real estate I Want you to own real estate real estate's a good place to have money it's a good thing to own to have a part of your life going forward but um but it's ... it's not necessary\nThat you get in a hurry on it to just just to you know just to say on a house Anthony is with us in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Anthony welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nOh Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm twenty two and I'm starting a air conditioning company and I wanted to know if I should we at least or\nUm by a van for say

another way\nOf financing something if you Lisa copier you financed your copier if you Lisa van you financed year than what you did you bought a van you couldn't afford to our guys too and so have you

good for you good for you know every sharp young entrepreneur man to win this thing off on your own you in the van and get that done huh yes their way to go man have you been working in the heating

wondering how much should we be allocating to enjoying time years he's really going to be Florida for um three years is it okay to eat until our savings a little bit or should we be living like or college students\nIt's up to you I mean what are your goals and where do you want to be you're kind of writing to horses at once I mean her careers up and going and obviously she's making some money or what is her into him\nUm she's making about fifty five\nOkay and obviously that's carrying the water for you guys right now and so you are and you can take two approaches to it you can say do what you're doing right now and live like you know Fifteen Percent going into retirement and that is heating up money that would be used for fun\nUm or or you can just say you know\nWe're in a a transition time while I'm In law school and so were you know we're really not walking the baby steps right now we're just going to be on hold and her income can be used to make sure I get through law school and make sure you know that we enjoy this time here in Florida and then when I come out\nThen we'll be with both incomes will be game on when you can take it either way or you could take anywhere in between if you want um\nYou know obviously the more you live like no one else the more later you live and give like no one else obviously a by right and and so those are ... there's the choices you do um the the point I think the good I did the good part of this discussion is you're actually thinking about it and whatever you do at least you're going to do it on purpose\nThe the danger of backing that retirement off substantially and a ... is that you might not ever go back to this\nLove this show has been\nThe big week and it continues through eight pm tonight central time this was an ... week or ... and ... pm too much time for the business boutique academy Begley Christie\nHuge it's been so find David amazing to see these stories coming in and women are\nYou know they're joining the academy they're posting and they closed the academy group than I'm doing it scared I'm going for it a couple of women have already been exploring the training videos and saying things like I've already got my money's worth and I've been in a two day so it's just incredible it's been a lot of fun a lot of energy and a and you have to worry about it though tonight eight PM\nCauses so we got a few hours as their last chance to get in\nBefore we close them on a ship my focus and work on coaching them and walking with them and training them step by step so weak academy what is that we're talking about the little Missouri includes sure this is my online training group settle for women in butter women in business they don't want to start a bit and I keep getting asked the question more this poor fill in the blank business I Am a freelancer I have an empty shop I'm a\nProfessional organizer or an architect or I have a dental practice or whatever\nYou're all in business and that's what we do we help you build your business so some women may want to start their business and we have a foundation of course in the academy that showed them how to start\nAnd then all the other training videos we have over a hundred ... a teach them how to grow their business on a variety of topics and then every single week rolling out a new training lesson and I'm In their coaching them step by step\nAnswering the question holding their hand showing them what to do next and it's been really really fun to see the success stories of women that had been in the academy for the last year and a half since we started a winter saying things like you know I've grown up three times as much Robin ... the year before one woman said I make twenty thousand dollars more this year than a year before the academy\nSo just seeing the growth one woman her husband critical time job to go work for her\nAnd so these women are surprising even themselves but that's what happens when you get to help you need help happens when you have ... when you have a trainer right by your side so it's been fun to watch ...\nEspecially learn something new right you got to have a coach and you need a community that many people around you to encourage you and Dr you what to do and a true you own any cheerleaders because I got ya ya when you ...\nAround you to encourage you to show you what to do and a cheer you own any cheerleaders because I got to tell you when you try to do something different\nA there's always some cow standing also wrote just chewing\nLooking at you like like you to like you've lost your mind\nWhen you start a business there's always somebody who\nSecretly wishes they could do it when I hear you down the side and so you need cheerleaders you and people you know standing up and jumping up and down and go and you got this you can do this in fact yes it's scary yes we don't know what to do all the time we do it any way of doing it for Thirty years and you got to push yourself out of their comfort zone and\nBust up and do that and your knowledge and community or the two things that cause you'll be able to do the\nThe life change the transformation that you've got to do that's\nRight and it's interesting because you also you have those outside people like you were talking about that may not get it and they may not believe in your dream but you also have the fear in your own head that can be really loud and that was that's louder than the that her on the side well that's right I had a woman a write in just this week Emily that joined the academy and she said\nI have always dreaded business I don't have a business mind I don't have a business background the mere thought of running a business seem overwhelming but I had this dream and I wanted to do something and she said just two days now and the academy I've been watching these training lessons and you have me laughing and nodding along I never thought I Would actually look forward\nTo learning business you take all the intimidation out of it and make it fun and what a great compliment 'cause that's my heart David to take the intimidation factor out of business and show women you can do this you absolutely can do that you just need when anyone needs you just need help and that's why we're here that's all we had the academy\nYou know the interesting thing is is that sometimes when people are standing on the sidelines looking at the idea of opening a business or even if they're running their own business\nOr you know and they're in the beginning stages or are they are stuck at a place where the they just need a extra boost they need some knowledge they didn't have to go to a different level in any of those situations the interesting thing is is that people\nTend to think that ... those people have some kind of special DNA Jane right or like you have to be like this math ... or you have to have the entrepreneur dream or you have to dress a certain way or think of survey or whatever and the interesting thing is successful businesses are run by\nEvery type of person on the planet there every version of wild animal runs [laughter] I mean it's it's amazing\nI I use that example with selling because I think people have that mess about selling like I'm not sales person I don't want to be pushy and so on like a sales person is a certain type of DNA it's an extrovert it's a social butterfly someone that's a talker\nI use my example my husband all the time he's an introvert he's quiet he's steady\nBut he got me to marry him because the sale right are are seven and a half months and he was confident as can be a and so it's just you know selling or running a business is like anything in life it's a skill that you can learn like cooking or riding a bike and\nAnd that's why we built the academy with all of the training lessons that you need to learn the foundations to build your business to grow to the next level and then we have that customized coaching and say oh you've got a weird situation that help you walk through that situation and really the best products and services you can put out there is a response to the market and what they tell you they want him for two years people said\nI Need a coach I Need a mentor I Need help\nAnd this is our solution saying we're gonna help you were gonna walk with you and we've already seen the success stories of women absolutely\nExceeding their own expectations making far more than they imagine they could and so it's proven now it was an idea two years ago but it's proven now and it's working and a and I'm really excited for this new class of member coming in hundreds of joined us but Oh absolutely that's right and we're close in age tonight we've got a kickoff party at eight\nSo I don't want people to medics once it closes it's close to next year and we're kicking off tonight or start first thing Monday morning on our next curriculum so I'm really excited to have them walk with me\nSix months it causes it's close to next year and we're kicking off tonight or start first thing Monday morning on our next curriculum so I'm really excited to have them walk with me and be able to help them when\nChristie right Ramsey personality\nUh the founder of business boutique equipping warm women to make money doing what they love it's a best selling book is a three day conference that his almost

closing it is what why are you closing it will just keep it open all the time\nRather than always focusing on both promotion of marketing the academy and trying to start the members we thought you know look close that we're going to open it for one week do a heavy marketing push invite people show you know what is possible this week for them\nAnd then we close to a tonight I'm shifting the focus and I'm going to be walking with this group of women where we're not always you're going to die with for you and the team yeah do you allow you to that Israel and it's\nBeen up all your time marketing all the time and I are taking care of the people that are in their care right\nSo we're going to be in the academy focusing on them for this next year and walking with him and helping them grow and when you think about the price four hundred eighty nine dollars for the year\nI ... around a little over forty dollars a month this is still for a year's worth of coaching and training in your business you get your all I back some ladies are saying they get back in a couple of days so it's absolutely worth the money to invest in yourself and your dream for a full year of training but you got to eat tonight to get him now\nThat we mentioned to the community is a is a big part of this and so what I've found is is that um I might not know the answer and I'm pretty good business to someone squash writer on the air but if I put them in one of those communities there's probably somebody in there that notice you know\nThat's right and they're connect because women are so relational\nThey're already connecting just this week seeing the connection is being made hey who's in Florida I'm In Orlando let's get coffee hey who's an interior design I'm an interior design hey let's get together and talk about best practices Haiti how do you a source you know your for your vendors for your product\nThey're already connecting that allows her to be a compound effects that ripple effect that goes way beyond me some of the catalysts that guides the conversation and then it goes far beyond me or those conversations connections are happening twenty four hours a day in our face that great but it's really fun to see the impact that's made because we've created this community like you said\nNo and the community is an aspect of it and then you've got a bunch of videos for content\nYeah so we have a video training library that we're always adding to so it had over a hundred lessons kind of like a buffet like go and watch what ... hiring we've got lessons on that you

onto the floor with the caviar being that there was a one week investigation with parameters of you only can investigate the allegations of glassy forward and that's it\nThat there's a one week investigation with parameters of you only can investigate the allegations of glassy Ford and that's it so blessed the forwards allegations will be investigated and it ... the insanity of it all\nIs just on both sides right like you can't win for losing right like listen to a a senator Mazie Hirono\nI'm here standing that my colleagues because it's very clear that the Republicans will break every every rule to get this ...\nYeah every norm every rule that's they're breaking every norm every ruled they're destroying everything even though they've done is they've asked for this they're now getting this and it's still\nNot enough which is fine but at least the American people can see the BS and I tell you what\nStep back for a second if you will with your the partisan red blue the whole nine yards\nIf you're the Republicans and you play this right now we're going to get him on the Supreme Court if he's not done anything I don't think he's done anything although I've been wrong before and I'll be wrong again but on top of this you can play this partisanship into a a a ... and this trial in this entire dog and pony circus\nThat they've caused you can do this in a way that I think it helps you in a few weeks when it comes to the midterms\nI really really really really do here Senator Mitch McConnell\nOffers to on Republican or a member of a support\nThe motion to proceed to nominate one hundred percent of the Republican conference support\nFor saving for the capital nomination\nSo you go and I think that there were ... and while everybody jumping on flaking and hammering at him and he doesn't like Trump he doesn't like Trump\nHe's leaving and I have a feeling once he leaves\nThe Senate I wouldn't be surprised if he you know he's going to take a run I think at the White House potentially in two thousand twenty he doesn't like the way politics has gone on both sides of the aisle I agree with them and a lot of that because I'm not I'm not a huge fan\nAt the way that these things have come in and our tribalism right now and and and and as much as our tribalism is there and it's it's it's there for the world to see that's the issue was there for the world to see we're in a position where tribalism\nYears ago was in a newspaper and maybe at the water cooler now the water cooler follows you everywhere and we all have a voice so the tools to help the tribalism spawn itself\nMore than anything else but I think there's always been a cultural thing here to battle and now the cultural civil war just getting louder and louder\nI still think he's going to vote and before everybody lays the blame completely a Jeff Flake speed I have a feeling that Susan Collins as well as Lisa Murkowski\nAnd a few others spoke to him saying is there any way 'cause he was the only one that that there were there was in college or anybody else on that that that Senate judicial committee that could have done\nThis enforced there's the issue\nBecause I Do believe they all want to vote for him\nAnd I do believe\nHe has a real good shot of getting this as long as there isn't anything to insane in this ... but I really do believe that and but I think they want it to be short because they have to go back to their constituents and they realize the magnitude not only of the fact that they're up for votes but they also realize the magnitude of what potentially could happen here if he gets on knowing\nThat they helped get a judge on that potentially at least for some look at this is the greatest generational thing ever it's going to change the entire culture of America which I don't\nA judge on that potentially at least for some look at this is the greatest generational thing ever going to change the entire culture of America which I don't think it's going to happen I think we're the hyperbole is like I I Will freaking out but it is what it is but I think they really pressed him to do this\nAnd it's frustrating absolutely trust me Mitch\nI come at our callers on the credit for setting us impressive dominated here to the floor with fiber will recommend to show that we will keep the process moving\nThe whole set of over ... considering drugs Kavanaugh's nomination\nSo but they won't vote until they get back all of this stuff and I don't know what the stuff is going to say the the investigation is going to come up with a I think a lot of people I think and\nAnd and look I understand why someone like Mark judge that's the guy that everybody wants to use this march guy who's this character what's the all about\nHe is you know he's the guy that is a writer he is a conservative he has had a lot of issues when it comes to alcoholism and and a ... some issues like that\nUh with addiction and he's battled cancer and you know he's he's got some issues and and I'm interested to see out because they want to deposed him and they want to do it out in the open the the the the Democrats and they want to come after him and they want to do the exact opposite of what the Republicans did\nWhich I think with with with Dr Ford they did it a very good job and I think they handled the situation very well with the kid gloves I think they want to do the exact opposite with mark judge\n'cause they look at him as this evil privileged white guy and so it it's going to be very interesting to see the way that this has handled because you're also putting your faith in a guy who had severe issues with alcohol and addiction\nWho ... you know that may not be the person that that's going to give you the answers you want on either ...\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been to show\nIs your Twitter usage where that is a lot of stuff's still to get to want to hear from you what do you think movies this weekend get
