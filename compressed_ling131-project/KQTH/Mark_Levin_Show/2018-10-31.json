M. i.'s law\nMhm you know just like you and your ... and I don't get down to ... percent\nYou're you're you're turning your two broke to buy a house here in day out okay you're in debt you get your\nAgainst your retirement I mean you're straining at every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in the house substantially so we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is ...\nI own in house substantially so we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization by out of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that and a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchase\nBut uh when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bring his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nRather than a blessing\nSteven is in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI just wanted to know what would be harder to do right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yes or no hypothetically at me and my wife only had\n... mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward than investing whether it be smarter to put all of it into my IRA is or should I open up a rock for my and my wife's name and then flip the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand one hundred and fifty in each of them and watch her grow that way\nWhat's your household income or a household income and fifty thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it by beast of four into retirement is more like\nA ten thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um\n[noise]\nOkay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put\nThree thousand in more than three thousand and another okay one and not one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or are you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same\nSo it doesn't matter\nA hill I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up one ... five hundred in my name and five and in her but you have the exact\nIt doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise] the only advantage is just a relational\nIn that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else she's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name\nOkay okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement that's baby step for\nAnd that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ... which may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of bed and after having emergency if I Would tell folks temporarily not to save for retirement until you clear your dad's that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent away\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just\nThe money to put Fifteen Percent away and a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA right for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven hundred fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing James is with us from Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I are planning to buy a home next year and have a little trouble deciding or or agreeing on a house would not want to get a idling in towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to do those our parents myself mhm and she wants to move on ready house\nMhm occur and it'd be your first home\nThey are sick at all we had a house in a while ago and then we moved in with an rent printing for well over a year now you know\nThe other home that you had was at a fixer upper it was not it was live and ready ... ... and um so what is her fear\nIt's just for a ticket you know and kind of a hassle Amanda how ... I didn't want anything major just you know just some minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nAh financially I think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay I see what you're saying that you use a fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't have gotten them to do that I got you\nI'm a part time real estate agent so I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it I can sell it tax free\n... or any way out of my adult shelters for anyone to be a real estate I show how structure where you first residents would be limited to your factory growth on that anyone for anybody [noise] um\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your money we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time I get\nSome valid point on her you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument [noise]\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to\nGo to my wife is she still living would would continue to receive a lesser amount that's probably because I could take I can take it as no survivor and probably get more\nYeah but are you healthy yes\nI Would take it as no survivor getting more and by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you it's a better deal yeah go ahead and take all the money you can get you know\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in\nGood shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape as is his way above normal 'cause normal just sucks okay you gotta way better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I Would you know how you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I've thought about it for the health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these mega share programs do you\nThis is not driving\nConsidered that I've thought about it for the health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these men to share programs do you\nSee how it was not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much money\nRight\nAnd you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are you\nKnow forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem with a guy out here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual fund this becomes like a no brainer\nInstead you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe if we scrape everything together after the failed around properties and you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is an ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK\nI'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so\nI probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really\nFun that you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you didn't enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank\nAnd bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do some what you're doing out and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that her yeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but it's something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do not plan on work\nAnd it's not 'cause I Need money I don't need the money I got money coming in my ears but ... I'm working because I have a vast\nYou ought to find something like that and then you can work in hunt and fish and work and hunt and fish and farm and you know but but\nYou know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there's something you could do more than hunting and fishing that\nNot that that's what people are bad it's not you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out to the stage for the encore that's what the encore careers and a lot of people make a lot of money on that Richard\nSo and is not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more pad between you and Murphy then this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you that we all need still that's what I'm saying and it might be you take a year and you do nothing behind fishing farm and then you say at the end of that year I'm going to go do X and that's okay\nBut but Ninety for for the next forty years you're going to get tired of fishing [laughter]\nYou know bottom fishing [laughter] so\nFind something makes you smile when you do that's all I'm saying so I'm I'm gonna send you a copy of a book then again George called start because you're starting a fresh\nChapter and I think you'll enjoy the thank you for calling him to talk to your show [laughter]\nIs is

Ramsey show\n\nI'm foreigner yourself better than I deserve what's up\nWell the reason I'm calling today to talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm\nA hundred thousand of student loans and the ballots will be a credit card debt\nWe recently met with a financial adviser and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because it would take a long time to pay off the bat they suggested that saying that it will be better for us to just start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion\nWhat is your household income sure oh combined it's about eighty five okay you have any car debt ... mhm oh no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth\nOkay All right\nWell here's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor didn't know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advice student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nYeah we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was just thinking entirely as of the amount of credit card that we have\nFound in our ability and really have a ... there's more on the suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollars with a credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand\nThat's absurd dude that's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd does the ... that the hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless if it's not a bank reputable so we're dealing with you're going to file bankruptcy on thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year\nYeah one year live on fifty\nPay it off in one year take six extra jobs sell so much stuff you can't breeze no eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year what are your car's worth\nThe work world corner OK each\nUm her to a newer miles a little bit older so whereas\nOurs are working are hers is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine of about ... mhm\nOkay\nWell um you can do what you want to do I if I woke\nUp in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those if you choose to file bankruptcy ... two dead young lazy to address the situation\nLet's say even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year and your debt free other than your student loans I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt or be gone in one year so how fast\nDo normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\n... yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and um you know I I Would not move down in the car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living through the past\nOkay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\n\nI'm no she knows wetter but that's about it\nGun or does she do speaking Miami fishy speak on Sunday mornings\nYeah see that's where I'll be buried under\nOkay All right I mean I Wonder if if you know she might feel\nDo some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works and evangelists to outrage and they pay you are a little bit for speaking skills\nOr maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you had ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation of income and you guys\nDot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you had ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation of income and you guys tightened down your budget to nothing\nI mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing in four years maybe three but four for sure\nUh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry though that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you've got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you've got to stop living the way you've been living goes is not working agreed\nOn the staff does that make sense yes I like that yeah\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant\nAt the time but it yields a harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're not ... you're\nNot dumb you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it as I did a lot of dumb things in my life dude I'm with money in particular as high end up teaching is because I got a P. H. D. and D. U. MBA but ah you know if I don't I don't know who it was they gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nBecause they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you could not only can work through this I think you should work through this\nI think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack at an attack it and that you can start having a sense of self control this sense of discipline and it'll change your marriage on communication levels it'll lower the stress when you're working the plan

field\nAre you ... you know live no vacation with no eating out for a short period of time for a short period of time you live like no one else\nShow that later you can live and give like no one else I think about what how much how much money you would have and how well the you could become and how generous you could be if you didn't have any payments right now\nOh my gosh\nI think about the piece that will be in your house the stress that would be gone say it's worth it to pay a price to win but there's a price to be paid the price of the fat you got your\nOwn home and you don't get out of a

taxes in good growth stock mutual funds\nThat will cause you to make more money monthly than the monthly annuity check would have been because it is based on a lower rate of return than the mutual fund should per format\nTo make more money monthly than the monthly unlimited check would have been because it is based on a lower rate of return in the mutual fund should perform at and when you die with a pinch\nAnd the money's gone then it goes to pinch and have not the your heirs\nGoing euro or take the lump sum and narrow it over in an Iranian die [noise]\nStill there when you die goes to your heirs [noise] uh the you make a higher rate of return while you're alive and one hundred percent higher rate of return [noise] there's I don't keep your money not raise their so you're saying [noise] always some\nMutual funds direct transfer into [noise] good IRA so that with mutual fund so that in Texas [noise]\n\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nThen I mean again and we do need to go crazy on kids cars here ... is the thing is I don't want you to move down and\nRelax\nThe pressure to figure out is there a way to get the income backup I Want you to look down and keep the pressure on is there a way to get the income back up just for the fun of it because you know ... million ensure fun to make it again\nExactly in the house we're moving into to me is not step down the beautiful house that I mean it it's a house that everyone would love to live and it's you know I'm not going to be able to see the sun come up with the Atlantic every morning but I can live without that\nYeah yeah well and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we've got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna ... we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are for the next two years or

job or do you have the entrepreneur ... running\n[noise] yeah that's what my wife does she sells the clothing for that little row um and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when that time is to leave that retirement and benefits the security\nYou wouldn't believe it was her the mechanics thing to sell women's clothing [noise] yes ... ... are you already involved in the business\nYes she's been selling it for a year and a half um\nShe's ... she she makes in one week would I make a gross in a month as a mechanic mhm um so I wouldn't be going fulltime helping her with in voicing and shipping in the back office stuff while she sells all the dresses skirts\nMhm okay and and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can't hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back office shipping stuff\nWould that be the the best route to go as\nWell at least ten okay you walk away from fifty in order to do a job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do\n... for ten okay you walk away from fifty in order to do a job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do\nThat ... short\nWell she she gross is she is gross two hundred and ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what she grocers okay\nUnless you're going to add more to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now than it is not making sense\nOkay cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't three hundred and ten\nNo yeah she's got cost goods sold out of that that's not profit we're talking about there yeah ... is it is around a hundred thousand out of that she's going to have taxable income of a hundred K. and she needs somebody to do are shipping\nShe need a lot of help she's we're working to fulltime jobs that were working from eight AM to eleven twelve sometimes mhm okay\nSo the question then becomes what are you

living breathing document on the left side of the aisle it's kind of like open to interpretation it should be progressing with the times Trump sat down with ... and they talked about this and that's when he left the\nPolymers ration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution Wade executive order exactly\nOr have you thought about this how many more it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional member 'cause they want and you don't you don't\nYou don't write you don't so I was told them you need a constitutional amendment he's saying you don't and there's a few things in there and it's about language but a lot of people say well wait a minute just trying to change the constitution\nActually one of the fourteenth amendment getting us\nAnd there's a few things in there and it's about\nLanguage but a lot of people say well wait a minute just trying to change the constitution\nActually one of the fourteenth amendment to

to nothing to human emotions well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nWhy is that well it's about language remember we live in a world were words do matter and for all the craziness to get thrown around in the world of politics these kind of legal ease words and how they're interpreted really really matter\nCan at a very small minority of others are reading into that language in the constitution where it talks about all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there are\nA few folks not very many things that that language subject to the jurisdiction their eyes is a limitation that means children are undocumented immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and therefore are not birthright citizens\nThing that the president didn't was condemned the attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bomb the very first thing the media did was blame

is\nYou're damned if you do write in first of all you you talk about the birthright today and that gets a lot of other people that are showing up to protest that in a situation where people have died your also being accused of inciting by the media and a lot of other people you have people there who like the mayor\nAren't saying they don't want you there even though is reporting that they're just saying not the second\nWe just try to get the message out to the White House that our priority\nTomorrow was the first funeral I Do believe that it would be best to put the attention on the families this week and if he were to visit the shoes of the time to be able to do it our focus is the city\nWill be on the families and the ... reached with only this week in the ... for the film is to get through it [noise] ah once we get past that\nThen there's the opportunity for president\nAnd you know you can't say I want the president to be more of a United and a divider when he says he's going to show up to some of these things and you say well we don't really want you here\nOr because now you're dividing people in the end that's the problem than any president I mean we did the same thing with Obama right Obama you bought your head and and you about your nose and places you shouldn't about in your\nObama why aren't you where you're supposed to be because it's a president doesn't matter what side of the aisle everybody is going to be critical of your mood you're never going to make anybody happy and I think people need to understand\nThis you're president United States half the country didn't vote for you know\nSome of them may tolerate you bought a majority can't stand you or think very little of you at all which Trump\nThere isn't even that it's either they like you were they hate you very few people in the middle as far as their feelings their even people that vote for Trump I've talked to people who vote for Trump who can't stand Trump wanted anybody but Hillary or a Bush we've talked about that but they like his actions but they can't stand him as a person\nSo even some people who are like what he does have stand who he is and you know you you get people there today who are upset who are angry because of what happened and they're not directly blaming him for this\nBut they're just saying how 'bout you come out next week\nAnd he said look this is the only time right now during midterms that I have to to do this this is it\nAnd [noise] didn't\nDamned if you do and damned if you know three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter without us love hearing from you check out the old Facebook kid that's a place where kids used to be but now we're no longer there it's called Facebook but were there and we're

oh ho yeah Jews [noise] that's crazy you get the feel for yep she does your urban word of the day\nThank you for that and dated urban going about our understanding that there was an urban word of the day we damn stress shore cranium\nHe has certainly I think [noise] found those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\nYeah yeah yes and at times it [noise] it it's never enough right he comes out and says white supremacy or even with an awful\nLet's be fair to ourselves not so much a wink and a nod but you know just going to you know I mean there there was a time when I go to I I Wish you would have done more when it comes to this\nAnd the shooting\nBut people are saying this isn't about him this is about the people who have died I agree I absolutely agree this is about the people that are mourning the people who have been through this the tragedy that took place in that neighborhood that is undeniable but you can't say you want the president there and then if the president don't doesn't show up at the third time that you want\nBut it's it's a no win situation I get what you wouldn't want them there any time of president Joseph anywhere whether they're loved or hated it is chaos\nHe just absolute chaos\nSo I can understand why you wouldn't want him there at this moment in time but then the people on the left and everybody else who's a critic ... can't say he's not trying to\nUnite the country because no matter what he does it will never be enough free you're just looking for what you're you're always looking for the gotcha moment 'cause that's what we were gotcha society every questions the gotcha we want to put people in situations that are gotcha\nSo it doesn't matter three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... show is your Twitter you can tweet at us I've got a crazy commercials come out for\nThe midterms which is really kind of interesting will touch on that Halloween are you excited with some of your favorite movies I'm going to be dressing up tomorrow I've got a couple of different outfits are will debut and you took it on Facebook and few other places such and such a [noise]\n\n\n\nSuch adventure and show [noise]\n\n[noise] that's falling asleep become a nightmare for you do you dream of getting a full night's rest boy am I glad those days are long behind me\nBased on my pillow I'm sleeping like a baby these days and so can you my pillow adjust to the shape you want and need tossed those flat worn out bellows and let my pillow changed the way you sleep wherever they're the one and only solution to your sleepless nights my pillows are made right here in the usa with a hundred percent machine washable and Dr ... Khan\nSo you had gangs like we're the east side long those and the crypts and the great street crypts and we had rolling twenties all kind of affiliated enough with each other they were going to cause problems\nRight so but what what\nThe kids that I knew that we are gang members when I talk to them they felt at a uh some of it was that a need some of that as a necessity that this was essentially became their family\nRight now take it to the point where you don't even need to do that anymore because the gangs are virtual and you can energize them that way\nThese groups have become very adept at spreading their message of hate and their ideology online uh and they do so with the the specific intention of influencing disaffected violence proud mentally unbalanced individuals\nYeah and that's big because what you're trying to do like somebody who gets murdered right it goes into Mars themselves for for you know for whatever reason right like a you know they're gonna blow themselves up they're going to crash a plane or ... whatever they're going to do\nWhat are those people\nDisenfranchised a lot of times they're desperate or some of them have families to try to take their their in a situation where it's no when and what do people that put their arm around you know you're doing this for Allah think of all the things you're going to get sick of all of this right you're doing this for you\nSituation where you know when and what do people that put their arm around you know you're doing this for Allah think of all the things you're going to get sick of all of this right you're doing this for you're doing this for whatever reason it's going to be great Jimmy made your family and you know what else famous because it can be cheering it's going to remember who you are they going to remember your name\nThe loners the same thing disenfranchised not quite all they're angry pissed off at the world blaming everything 'cause they're massive losers you get somebody going that that that is just in the echo chamber saying things over and over again and now and the difference is sometimes some people are trying to 'course you into doing things\nThat you would by the way never do you have to be a little course and then never going to do that\nWhere sometimes people are just in the echo chamber and saying things back and forth back and forth back and forth and that's not good but social media for all the great stuff it brings you\nFor all the fun right without\nRealizing it in many ways that the spread of hatred is out there because people on both sides of the aisle people on both sides of the love hate world they they use it and I think there's a lot more positivity out there the negativity but negativity like everything is that greasy wheel squeaks weeks weeks so it's going to get the oil\nTerrorists groups like ISIS and al ... and domestic extremist groups whether they be neo Nazi groups are anti government militia groups have all learned that they can influence a much larger group of people when they use social media\nYeah yeah much looked much larger why would I Want to speak to the people down the street where I could get forty or fifty one I can have five thousand or ten thousand\n...\nIt's I can somewhat retain a remain anonymous it's\nIt's crazy it is and you've seen an uptick an anti Semitism and it's not just crazy white people I think a lot of years it's only white people there there's been an uptick of anti Semitism for the last couple of years uh and I know Trump gets blamed for everything but you know what it has\nPlenty of blame for everybody to go round that it it's I'm sick of the blame game that the blame game sold nothing like how did we get here how do we go about fixing this water the the the tactics that we need to start\nTaking and addressing without crushing people's free speech right without getting allowing corporations to dominate\nAnd and set up the you know as Google has a good sense or\nYou know we don't want that but what can we do to be fast acting and and first into this and police ourselves to a certain way because what ends up happening is we're not pleasing ourself when we're not going out there and fighting the good fight of you know not being a holes what ends up happening is Google and everybody else thinks that they have to do it for us\nAnd we're not going to you I don't care what you do you're not going to save everybody you're not going to stop every crazy person with a gun you're not going to stop every evil person with a gun no matter how many measures you take\nI think a lot of people think that and that's just not the way it does and the more that you disenfranchised and piss some of these people off the further they go underground the more angry they get then you start to lose touch with them and that's when it becomes even scarier\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... who is your Twitter Paul question up today with the birthright citizenship kerfuffle that\nTrump has thrown out there called she needs to you uh my friend he\nShould get rid of it forty six percent he's like yes we should twenty percent that nah twenty

somewhat funny and it's a put out by\nKnock out the vote and they're trying to get the youngsters and what they've done in this video is they got the oldest ... white people you can find to essentially make fun of young people for not voting dear young people don't vote\nThough that I think is find a way it\nIs that he's a guy tax cuts for the rich [laughter] oh yeah our riches\nClimate

election will be there but you out because we're a generation of doors Weiner's we're doing great\nWell that makes me laugh and you know\nSo well they're trying to make a point here as the all white people are evil if you watch them or is that it's kind of one of the ways that kind of took it a and it's all their fault that Trump's in office while they're trying to make the point the point to me made me laugh is they don't show up\nWe've heard before right we're we're ... you see I said you know what we can get all excited and do you want but don't count it as to show up on election day and that is the truth don't count open all your eggs that basket that they're showing up and somehow changing the way that this country's moving at least not now as they get older\nThey will not what's more fashionable to march than it is the ... it's more fashionable\nReady to throw a a a keyboard warrior\nThan it is to be anything else and voting is one of those things they're very apathetic when it comes in and they move on\nThey get past they get angry they pitched the wind them on the screen that yeah but when it comes to doing and that's the big thing doing I could care less about your
