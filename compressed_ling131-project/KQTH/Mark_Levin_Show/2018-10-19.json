about ...

with where I'm at a question it is\nI'd make a decent living now but I'm just content I'm kinda happy with where I'm at a question it is that I mean\nI don't know I mean it it it is it bad to play like that if ... if I'm if I'm content and but there's definitely room to grow so my question I guess was I'm not sure which direction to head because I'm going to spot where I'm fairly happy\nBut Wyoming so tell me why you're happy defiant briefly\nWell I think possibly and I myself that maybe like green picking up a good lead but I'm I'm happy because I Know my business close to home\nI don't travel a lot anymore and um I've got time and get their money they're too well\nCongratulations well it's almost like you're feeling a little guilty for being content you know days purchased contentment Rachel cruise almost wrote an entire book on contentment content that does not mean\nThat you're in a bad place I think you're happy you're thankful you're you're grateful you've been able to work hard and get into a new space I think what you're feeling is the itch to continue to challenge yourself and by the way that is also a good feeling you can be content meaning I'm grateful for what I have\nBut I'm not happy with who I Am so I'm very content I\nI'm honestly living the dream\nThis is the greatest time of my professional life I'm having a black However I'm not happy with who I

know I think you\nBecome a successful yeah in any way to ... to ... and ... it's well done um the thing I did one are kind of hit the same place you are was I started the first stage of business and you've passed it substantially\nIs to take care of your family and to survive and for the business to survive and they don't you get her ... once you get past the desperation\nOf that stuff and uh then the thing starts so you can control some of the variables and you brought in somebody to do some of the work you didn't want to do\nAnd you brought it closer to home and you're making good money and the show\nThat that's the next step and that's what I Do I as an example uh when I hit that stage people started saying well you'll never be successful radio if you stay in Nashville all the big radio shows are in New York or LA and I'm like what am I going to be a big radio show them 'cause I'm not going to live in New York or LA I don't mind visiting people but I'm not living there\nI like Nashville and uh well you got to have an army I have a seven minute commute and I live in a huge freaking house I'm not leaving [laughter] you know so that you know that's where you get to so then I started to go how can I expand this without how can I expanded and scale it without destroying the parts that are finally achieved\nYou know you know and so can you hire some people can you expand your product lines\nCan you make it digital or I mean what can you do to grow the business\nBut do it from a position of content ... now that you've got the variables controlling and that's that's the

you\nKnow they said how are you taking my call sure how can I help\nI can recall Harry Potter cat regularly you cut out five nights and got serious about three months ago my husband and I said I\nDon't care about that I like that and and we have if I did a a you know you get that if he wanted to take at the Internet well I think the hard Africa in our area actually at a moment when he died we decided to Christ and I've heard from I\nThink you know I like I said I'm Wondering if you have any last minute way different than what people like I could have never taken that the EU and we're starting out by meeting of course you have a random family find that wow you know I'm really excited so\nWhy did eleven people sign up but they knew you interested you\nKnow and then I Know yes I

all you gotta do is be able to turn on the DVD player play me yet but about whatever the lesson on me up and about that night and then put chairs in a circle and love people and be yourself the other thing is always just talk about the times\nThat you failed or that you were unsure or that you'd goofed\nOr whether it was ten years ago or ten minutes ago um because that gives other people permission to not be perfect and there seems to be this illusion with people that everyone else has got their money act together but me I'm the only do for ... and it turns out we are all do fishes\nYou in the um\nYou need to\n\nCome all hospital your knee journalist Canadian in mind coverage on line anytime you dont\nWith us from San Diego high one well some of the day Ramsey show\nBy Dave are you doing better than I deserve sir how can I help\nOkay so um [noise] I mean my wife we sent me\nJust water settlement of a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and we're not really a green aren't aware of this money should go oh my goodness what happened where did you get a settlement that large from [noise] uh I got in a pretty bad motorcycle accident Mm how're you doing\nAh I Am I'm blessed to be here on actually altering okay\nYou're physically coming back\nA yes or my body recover great so I'm happy I can do just a little bit or I'm a movement issues in my shoulder but besides that I'm ...\n... you got any future surgeries coming up a no okay well good well I'm Glad you're I'm Glad you're doing so good that is awesome okay so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on [noise]\nSo me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but she um [noise]\nWe're we're we're we're not agreeing on is that she wants to put the majority of the money\nAll the down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies ... and I think major the perfect time to get rid of all like that and also have a good amount for a down payment on a house ... and still have some leftover but she's not agreeing with me with that and I just wanted to hear\nYour opinion on what you think would be the better move\nWell she's not agreeing with you I don't\nThe uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get it we have about forty five thousand dollars\nAnd ... I Would pay that off and I would hold twenty back for an emergency and put the rest is your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble and so on and so\nMy vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she wouldn't listen to make now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new list and I'm trying to get her on board mhm she's not really to come veins but also having trouble getting her on board with the plan as well yeah\nI can imagine so um I I\nHighly recommend you don't do anything\nUntil you can come into agreement\nOkay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing until we can come into agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial peace university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nUh when I was there when I asked when I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial base university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mind would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the house is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you OK because if you go by yourself it will cause a divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more excited\nAbout getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two classes with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive\nBut ah but don't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pick up I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon date how you doing gay\nAnd better than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good Faye I'm with my wife and I are few coordinators had looked at St get free and we need your wisdom and guided something where we also have a little disagreement [noise] um last you see that her son got very we loaded with money to help them out\nKnowing knowing that we would never probably see the money and again okay [noise] um\nWhy would you do that you're ... ...\nYou know what that's a good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year and I\nLeft a touch with it\nA good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year I lost touch with ... with that aspect of it but um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take a class which they did but in the end they didn't discipline Metallica our principles\nAnd Henri building a ... at all mhm well after six months we decided to see what kind of make the U.S back anything we kind of let them know we weren't going it alone and be more money because\nThey had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and I knew was no communication to indicate me on her famous back well\nYou know as life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down and um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work this is where it gets sticky 'em knowing that my wife had to take care of her parents trashed would be dispersed you find this to all the fisheries recruited him\nWe both agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would\nImmediately pay us back when the checks and some of the logic was it they were bar income as long as they were already keep them by her her parents trash\n'em as it today we have not distributed that many but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here it's going to be distributed next couple of weeks and we wouldn't do what you do in the meantime leave they took out I'm a five or a a thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of overdo rent\nThe otherwise they'd be um evicted and our daughter live just does not want to work to help out\nSo my angle is interested in ... mirrors and because we have not demonstrated responsibility and came back with our loan I have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as that goes to this is my wife's side\nThat my wife write the check to them have them come over sided or just and we would write them a check for the balance of what they didn't ... how do we didn't we didn't read them and it seems simple and we know that if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptation then using the ... and ... says not Tina's back has agreed and be they might be more proactive to solving this\nShow that much from a nine thousand dollars\nRight yeah and he had to you right now what's your network now what's that what's your net worth\nA ... [noise] I don't know five hundred six hundred what's your household income uh ... thirty maybe okay and\nLet me just say oh you know here's my opinion this is all your fault\nMy fault yeah OK you loan money that we're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which would you loan family money right you're the one made this mess\nI okay I take the job or the now and trying to correct it they're not making it worse yeah and so I'm\nWondering you could do as you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot I should have given you might have never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right it she she believes that that we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse us\n... or ... that's my angle on her bronze are not going to not some and legally ridiculous assumption that is not going to have you mail a check them you're never going to see this money and then you decided to not speak to your own children over money or not this is the crap you get into\nEmail a check them you're never going to see this money and then you don't have the shot if you're just ... shoulder and over money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money all your fault\nIf you want to if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do this again\nIs absolutely ludicrous\nFor all the trouble you've caused caused every bit of [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each has dead in a struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with

Benson show [noise]\n\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanics mind something wrong and surprise\nYour hit with a huge repair bill\nAnd what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty your paying out of your own pocket to fix it that's why I recommend extended vehicle protection from costs you if your car has five thousand two hundred and fifty thousand miles car shield can save you from paying high repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousands\nYeah and that right there is a and a demo a who is a disinformation researcher talking about Twitter and all of these things that they've released that an ten million tweets from foreign operators going all the way back two years and what is it to do well fear\nWe talked about greed fear deep it's always about voting and emotion it's about a voting and emotion\nAnd and I get this now I get people who send me stuff some people send me stuff and they want to like I I'm going to prove a point other people send me stuff and they say stuff like\nIs this true and then I'll have to go look at the website right look at the website and a lotta times\nTheir Web sites that are here in America there are American run websites who have their they have their ideology that they have and they're going to spend something or they're gonna leave out half of the story\nAnd that is it that that is frustrating but you have to look at the ... the website how reputable is it who are these isn't it amazing that the only lines up with the way that you believe because for a lot of us\nIt's about affirmation it's not about information so it was easy to do you pick a few things and I see it all the time when we posted in St and do stuff what what agitated angry people what doesn't it's not hard to tell\nOne of the really striking example just after the San Bernardino shooting in California in December twenty Fifteen most of the trolls were posting about the need for the second amendment and and to protect gun rights but some of the trolls posting civil dynasty and using the same hashtags to push for\nGun control because they don't care for the whole thing is to disrupt people like this they just wanted to disrupt\nPeople here who want to sell something if you will a about a politician about a prop they're going to tell you half a story or bend the truth or in some cases out now lie\nBecause they want you to vote for something here it was about a disruption they didn't care if they could just upset the apple cart\nThat's the whole thing and the frustration is there's so many people buy into it and this is where I get\nYou could just upset the apple cart that's the whole thing and the frustration is there's so many people buy into it and this is where I get frustrated because I look at this and I think\nVery nanny state if they want to turn this into now like Facebook and Twitter and all of these companies are getting together with the government and they're there and it will we need to protect these people look if you're an idiot in a mean\nHappens to invoke such an emotion out of you and I see it out there every single day I see it out every day if you were so upset about a mean or something and your so influenced by that that's all you write your gullible\nYou're ... if he loses you that much you're gullible it's it's it's that's that's just the truth\nWill the accounts tried to do is Moscow grade as read American activists and then engage with three American activists communities\nAnd they did they didn't know how much influence they have that's a different thing\nBut remember ever it if you study psychology study any of these things it's about voting and emotion 'cause emotions will get you to do I always hearken back to what an emotion can do for somebody when I go back to the fact that ah that the [laughter]\nThat astronaut woman who was so enraged and in love and emotion for that and the other astronaut that left her she drove across country wearing adult diapers had like duct tape or in a car her motion was so\nThat to me it's just oh how do you do well in motion when you can get people to to\nTo not have a conversation to be blinded by something so much so and when I Do my when we do videos we do all these kind of stuff all season people chime in and there are a motion is so strong on some certain things\nIt's it's crazy it really is you take a step back take a breath but they're blinded by then what happens they get Indian dated every single day\nBy step because they're looking and they're searching and and they're searching for some of the left does it with their micro aggressions and things like that\nThe right does the same thing too and everybody searching percent what can I find what can I find I Want some affirmation I Want some affirmation oh this person asked me what country I'm from so therefore they're they've offended me or this over here this mean came through and this has to be true about Elizabeth Warren or something like that\nAnd it's a motion it is a motion emotion emotion and you're being manipulated and you don't always know your right because sometimes the stuff looks so real but in saying that that's why you need to be\nWell versed in a lot of these things meaning you have to do some research if you're serious about am I being manipulated you'll do some research if you only one affirmation then at that point in time it doesn't really matter and the main is only firing you have to do something it's not actually changing your mind because your minds already made up\nYou can actually see through the lifetime of these accounts they were posting more and more radical contingency we're trying to get people more and more riled up because that's when they got the most impact so that's the way social media tend to look more emotion you put into it the mole feedback you get\nYeah again emotion greed all of those things the best sales book you'll find in the world has nothing to do with sales has old to do with the psychology you want to learn how to sell go down and get a psychology book\nBecause when you can find a psychology book that that has the right kind of tone that you know that you can start to manipulate 'cause that's what it is\nSome people buy stuff but a lot of people are sold stuff how do you do it with the motion you can look great in his car unit tons of women you can make so much money if you do this or by this it's it's nuts it's crazy it's about emotion three two three five three twenty four twenty three
