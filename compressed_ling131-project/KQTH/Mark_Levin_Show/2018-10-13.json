for taking my call sure what's up [noise] well\nMy my wife and I have a pay down a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you and\nWhat we've only got about two hundred and ... ... ... because we have our mortgage oil three rental properties that we\nHave mortgages on and and those two and a half years we've had a fungal graduate high school or college we've been paying\nAbout half the tuition would have been taken out loans for the other half and I stopped contributing to a four one K. and if I got a beginner baby step save but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm\nNot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand okay\nShow can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd it stopped the studio is if we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental properties as we've been for the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear it or because he's got two younger brothers they're going to be going to college to here in the next few years\nAgo yeah well ... maybe steps for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college what you want or cash flowing in this case\nAnd on the sixes payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really does you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to\nPay on your mortgage is yeah which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our Confederate that we should just save up a a a three three maybe four month emergency fund that then yeah\nAnd then and then ... then I stopped taking out student loans yeah and\nClear him out and then do the same with the other day and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we start throwing it at your\nYour mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounded like a rental are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nYeah it's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies okay a fifty as you said to Fifteen ... yeah yeah and for yeah one's only one of the only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still on the take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental ... there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right uh yeah still I'm just going to blink along on those minimums and take care college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw enough to have to probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about first getting back in the world\nThe four one K. a Fifteen Percent now well okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund\nRight yeah emergency fund his baby step three and then by bishop Forrest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nActually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five or six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there was money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list as mortgages is that so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneous does that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before Schiphol tree to tree I guess technically you're skipping five or ... yeah yeah\nYeah and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're\nDrilling or a lawyer with what you buy an order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nI'm In the it's an honor to talk to you can send for ya okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now we listed it ends alive for two Fifteen [noise] um I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter]\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um what we're struggling with piers we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market and my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that that occasion 'cause it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm a realtor than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in in Harrisburg proper then no no I'm In like northeast yesterday a up and you're up near New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yeah\nThe uh I mean three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nA is there anyone in that resort area\nIf you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our military that does not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these it so\nLike everybody's second job [laughter] so why are you moving\n[noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work we can't I Can't do it anymore you know okay I mean kids you know we're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem or you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at they're looking at it on line there just workers or not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was I walked away there were not\nClient's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\n'cause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor I'm saying that others are his hold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer for us to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and\nSays gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the\nPerson that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area and and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area and they and they don't have a central ... do you need it it's a very unique [noise] semi rural somehow resort situation\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ...\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and simply wasn't that way on one of\nThose ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to Dave Rand date handler onboard and the beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the\n... which really only heard it was really difficult to to give out some things that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of oil down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show them and said we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's a beach with the legs that kind of stuff\nWith the income you've got and no debt even do anything you wanted to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean as you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so right man it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible\nUh family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say interesting very interesting\nSo um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um [noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off who were able to pay off the home that we live and mhm\nAnd so we we use the cash derived from that\nPlus cash flow and some savings to pay for our home that we live and okay so it was just three properties the that's where I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt which everyone operates okay ... ... worth what one point six wow you guys are amazing congratulations\nWell and obviously holding back then and clearing that that's a big part of the equation sure yeah 'cause that's secure then amazing\nAbsolutely amazing so you're sitting there with a net worth well in excess or two million dollars now easily I'm the I'm guessing it for one case but with this income you got to be loading up so um\nHow Sheffield feels great I mean I'm you know I'm

for taking my call certainly how can I help\nUm well I just started get program and August I'm I have currently pay down three thousand dollars in that um that they've got to actually that's that I was making painted on a monthly payments on how\nI'm right now I Need to start on like that that will collection which will get out I think little mountain dollars mhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm last like addict Seventeen hundred dollar bill that there there are\n... finally hired for a friend of mine was telling me that that thousand dollars that were given mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if true\nThat is true that is not giving us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for\nGave a cashier what's your household income [noise]\nUm [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand a year\nOkay so let's say let's say you're a ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal what's your yeah your I have about\nTwo hundred dollars per thousand so that is forgiven that hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but if in the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so yeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have and in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell then in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question thank you for joining U.S Open\nPhones this hour as we talk about your life and your money our question that comes

of credit isn't worth having or should I avoid it\nWell a line of credit is an approved alone that you take out only when you would want to know where you could get pre approved\nAnd have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\n[noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe try to take it the other way we want you to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one once you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what your house\nMoney the bar or a slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles\nLadies like one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle or they're typically well built I mean you again on Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body Ford products for just building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nAh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we kind of depends on your budget and how nice of car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so I was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um so you know you just you're looking at your situation to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't you know I Can't because I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it it's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how're you\nHey they think I think my cough Sherman what's up\nI'm standing on a haiku emir I've got about three thousand dollars and like I mean the count out donating shut eye in bed and I knew what China then you're going to college yeah I mean any college with an a plus for entertainment and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... served five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges is either and you're right I Know our first yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be an hour or whatever\nLike that okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it a\n... here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nOn a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was erode that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really going to cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make much better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds\nSome of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage a with this amount of money in your situation because again my\nMain goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nAnd your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four\nYear degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools and your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise] if\nYou need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nOn Gray Davis an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nDon't my wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can protect retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay into our dilemma is when we said an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we're already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from all agree to fail ration so when we say ... percent were able to have a lot for a mortgage to toleration though is it okay to do that or him recommend saving the twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in or ... or you vested in that is that a ... choosing an investment for that or is that a pinch and\nGet the answer is no options yeah I just mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nGuy I probably would split the difference because I don't like\nThe pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run through\nIts horribly run state and now we're ... those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we got us before then that means we need to put it in ten percent right you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois
