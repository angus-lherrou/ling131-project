world that you can have is your mind and anymore it's not about that it's about either you believe what I Believe or I Want nothing to do with you and that is not a country I Want to live in\nNo it's not and I I it's it's so strange to me watching again I if I use that term zombies earlier but it's like I've seen people who I think they probably once upon a time not so long ago where normal\nAnd they're just\nThey're ... it's like invasion of the body Snatchers you know it's like I I see videos all the time because you know I think things are getting worse and worse the closer it getting to the terms uh is is not helping but you know I'm seeing videos every day of people on the left just becoming completely unhinged and going bananas ah and\nAnd almost every time it's not even based off of something that's really actually truly legitimately happening it's something that the media has told them as happening which isn't true and then they're going absolutely I mean they're they're losing their minds\nAnd and it's very strange\nI I mean I I feel I probably shouldn't say this but it's just it's the truth that's how I feel and I'm all about telling the truth whatever but I feel really weird when I see so many men doing this like because like I'm seeing all these videos all the time of like\nMen who are like freaking out about feminism and stuff and and the ... which is great I think we're like you said earlier were all about protecting women we all care about women but there's it's not that it's like the lives that the media is telling\nAbout how the right wants to hurt women and then I see these men going bananas about itself and I'm like\nI don't you get like they are being manipulated I it's just so weird to me I it's it's so strange\nYou know what it is brand and it's I Love watching them they they're everybody got and then they put themselves in a position how much further can I go you went this far well let me show you how far I can go these like the man feminist or whatever it is\nThat is the biggest weasel and all they're trying to do and for lack of better term is they're trying to get some and it's this whining about it that he ever\nI'm a man I'm assist gender heterosexual cracker mail and I will tell you this right now I Love women I Want to protect women are\nAnd and I want equality or but I'm not going to bend over backwards to put somebody into a protected class like species because it's not the way it should be but it's ... it's ridiculous\nWell it is and it's yeah I mean you kind of hit the nail on the head with a basically there's there's two different classes\nOf of men are may possibly more but I mean there's kind of the fate of males which you're just sort of like what happened to your masculinity when you watch this but the ones that I was describing a moment ago or you know I just feel like I'm seeing all these videos lately of men on the left who are like attacking it\nIn a moment ago or you know I just feel like I'm seeing all these videos lately\nOf men on the left corner like attacking even women on the rights I mean there was a video that I saw the other day of this woman she was wearing a Trump hat\nAnd out and publicly crossing the street and there's a guy behind her I mean he looks like ... seconds away from punching are in the face and at one moment she even said he said something to make some nasty snide comments about nine eleven or something and she said actually my husband died on nine eleven and he goes good good he deserved it\n... and I'm like what what the hell happened to you you like what is going on\nYeah we've lost the plot we've lost ... talking to a ... he's a\n... the founder of the tag walk away movements so you've got this big thing it's October what twenty seventh and you guys are going to get together and uh and that's what think progressive saying as this Russian trolls because that's that's that's where they go with everything now everything's Russia's fault and and everybody's own right uh so tell us about what's going on there [laughter]\nYeah so uh we're doing a walkway march on Washington weekend which is the twenty sixth of the twenty eighth and obviously in DC [noise] um so that's coming right up it's a week and a half away the weekend after this one\nFor kicking it off the ballot dinner at Trump International hotel uh it's gonna be incredible um [noise] we're going to have lots of kind of high profile you know conservative celebrities on the right who are coming to attend to dinner and people are going to be speaking and it's going to be really just sort of like an elegant way to kick the weekend off and then the next day is the main event the march and rally\nUm which is open to for anyone to attend 'em and I want to make really clear to because I Do get these messages [noise] more often than I Would like with people saying you know I Would love to come here march rally it sounds so great but I didn't walk away so I don't think I should count\nGuys listen this is so important to people the people in the right who have been conservatives your whole life or Republicans your whole life you are what we call the walk with\nAnd your your attendance\nAt that march and rally is really the most important thing because all of these people who are walking away from the Democratic party and walking away from liberalism a lot of them are walking away from their friends are walking away from the family they're walking away from their jobs in some circumstances they need to know there are people on the other side who are going to walk\nWith them that they're not going to be alone that's why people stay people stay 'cause they think if I I think I I hate what this party stands for I don't even recognize anymore but I Can't leave\nBecause I'll lose all my friends they need to know there are people walking with them\nSo for those of you on the right who are lifelong conservative that Republicans come out\nTo this event and you see the walkway march on Washington a walk with those who are walking away and then we're closing the whole thing out on Sunday at the twenty eighth with a closing brunch and punished as soon

spiteful hateful love hate relationship\nFinancially because of the big investment sort of flown into our country or our country and our companies here\nAlso when it comes to like you said the the the fact that you know ...\nWe're worried about Iran they don't like around so what do we do but if you're looking for the neat bow that's going to go on and this and it's going to be a mystery that's going to be solved I don't think that's going to happen why he was killed nobody knows\nRight did the prints order it was it a wink wink nudge nudge from are from our our group here because maybe want the prince gone and we're like let's\nSee if we can trace this thing up in this guy's the sacrificial lamb or was it because of the voice that he provided to a lot of people in the middle east of freedom and things of that nature and he talked about that uh what was that one of the reasons why that he was essentially\nEliminate it there is a lot of things that that that\nWere never ever ever ever ever going to know but when you listen to his last\nWords you understand the kind of influence the Adam ... you know as far as his last words on paper because now he's back was writing op ed for the Washington Post she's got three kids that are American three boys are Americans\nThis is somebody who had almost two million Twitter followers in a world where there's not a lot of freedoms he was finally happy that he had some freedoms to hopefully spread and he talked about the tyrannical world that she came from\nAnd it has ... ... just to understand the Arab world and they get for freedom of expression\nThe Arab world is facing its own version of it on cousin he says in post ... through domestic forces he goes on the rise of governments are being given free rein to continue silencing the media that's an increasing rate\nYeah so that's interesting right that's very very interesting so I don't know I don't know but I Do know that\nWhatever we're told probably won't will that will have little bits and pieces of truth but not the whole truth\nBecause there's ten ways you can go with this and if you're a big conspiracy theories you can go in a thousand different directions\nBut it doesn't look good for Saudi Arabia and doesn't\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three I had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us and if I you know he talked about that that that right there in the sense that you know you have these tyrannical\nCountries who are shutting down free speech and it's not ... it's not because the constitution says because you've got royal families in dictators who wants to control everything we live in a world of free speech\nThat is being controlled and a lot of ways\nBy companies right technology Internet media Tim if you will and the fact that these huge\nCompanies these Internet companies these media companies control so many things and then it can be platform people and the the ideas that they have or only one sided ideas anymore and that is an echo chamber that they're in is a scary thing\nWhen you think about it this is Brian average who's a former Facebook or employer employee and it it's very interesting when you listen to him talk about this because ah it it's it's it's crazy\nAnd that's to me is scary when you start thinking about it\nIt's very interesting when you listen to him talk about this because ah it it's it's it's crazy and that's to me it's scary when you start thinking about the platform in people we saw with Alex Jones right\nAnd and and the weirdest Alex Jones is is how fast it went how quick it went how how all of them deep level and it's their right to do it it's their business\nIt is but when you can control the narrative and the narrative inside of this business is only one sided and the fear of God is put into people if you there's talk about anything other than that that to me is scary\nFor an engineer at Facebook has left the company says he's set up the company's culture\nYou know the thing is that the company to actually take the the the sort of assertions and claims that I've made it very seriously\nBy hand you know they are they didn't hire me they engage me there's a really big distinction between how those executives are handling this um and what a vocal minority inside the company is doing and they're they're\nYeah so you know it [noise] it's crazy\nBut you look at it we live in this we we we pride ourselves right like it's like the first amendment I mean that's that's just the first one like our founding fathers or what his number one\nBad right what's number two bamboo we go way down and it's not her\nYou know as much as Trump screens hates the media and the whole nine yards reality is the media's they love they hate him and he loves to hate them and they both need each other and it's a game they play we see a guy that's getting murdered over there\nThen we come over here and we're seeing people who have a different voice in a lot of ever at different ways who are getting shot down or getting cold certain things\nAnd\nYou're not just going to set up your own YouTube tomorrow your own face but you know the kind of money\nTo do something like that now rivers in Hollywood\nRumors in Silicon valley but there are several billionaires they're watching and looking at this thing saying you know what this isn't a very good thing this isn't good for America this isn't good for for for free speech and who we are and that maybe just maybe it's time to look at some sort of competitors that can\nThat can allow people to do to enjoy themselves whether they you know a one to talk about the things they want to talk about it or just do mundane things but not to censor and I think that's a good thing\nThere is a vocal minority inside Facebook that is the loser is beyond belief in a quest I think to implement social justice policies you know across our mission basically\nYeah\nAnd and that is crazy and when you can look at the way to think about this they can silence you or me or anybody else without actually even the platform you they can make it so they can bury any things that you put out there\nSo you can't be found\nYou think you're posting and you're like why am I getting any likes her hits why that was why aren't we why aren't they getting this why aren't getting that why is is I post something or like something and I'm getting in trouble and if you just feel that if you read the new standards for Twitter\nNow I have not here's the thing\nYou may not post something or say something on Twitter that is wrong but they can examine all of the stuff that you're doing including your outside work and they could deem you to be\nBad and take you off where having nothing to do with where\nThese are the things that are happening and when the monopolies as big as it is\nI don't want to kill with they have a lot of competition to it right fine that's the way you want to be a problem with it but don't tell us your one way\nRight fine that's the way you want to be a problem with it but don't tell us your one way\n\nAnd what they're what they're trying to set up is weird this way we know where this way\n\nWe want to be able to do the things that we want to be able to do and even if it cross the line we feel we have moral high ground if you cross what we think is the line we feel that we have every right to do to ban issue and to get rid of you\nAnd call you the names we want to call you and that right there is is ridiculous and the challenge is going to come because people are or are sick and tired of it and there is the intellectual dark Web that's out there if people that are talking about the people that are on the left in the right who are sick and tired\nOf of seeing the way that these things are being handled\nIt just looking at and the way the hate speech policy is implemented like on on the platform and you can't even have conversations about fed policy inside of the company without having your character attacks that I've experienced personally\nWithout being called a sexist or racist or trans ... have conversations about\nThose kinds of anything that the tenet of the social justice city all effectively without having without being attacked personally\nAnd that's that's the sad thing and that's where they're going to go I think in the future because they know everything about you right they've\nGot all of your information from from Google to all of these things and they'll figure out a way if they can't get you through the hate speech or this that and the other but they want to de platform you they'll maybe they'll come after you personally\nAnd you're seeing more and more and more and more and it is I think it's going to come back eventually invite them they asked but I

people every\nDay that anger in Belgium on different parts of Europe and they asked me did what the hell is going on\nWhy are the Democrats a lot to do this and then you know I got it by the fact that we're freedoms and all that other stuff [laughter] except the damn\nShame it really is what they have done and can are continuing to do and quite frankly they'll stop at nothing short\nOf starting to Republican\nRome you know but at least one has already been shot a and um the you know the the Bernie Sanders volunteer that\nThat shot him tried to kill as many Republican members of Congress as he could on that baseball field senators and\nAnd house members and that didn't seem to make an impact on anything did it down I mean that was that was a two day news story and the Democrats were never taken to task and Bernie was never taken the test and\nUh he was the gunman was James Hodgkinson was a big MSNBC fan Rachel Maddow fan no problem for them that's not offending somebody you know you may remember Bill Clinton trying to blame Rush Limbaugh on conservative talk radio for the Oklahoma City attack\nSaying somebody you know you may remember Bill Clinton trying to blame Rush Limbaugh on conservative talk radio for the Oklahoma City attack\nKilled a hundred and ... people you know we've got this ah James Hodgkinson with a rifle trying to mow down as many Republican members of the house and Senate as he could uh a Southern Poverty Law Center follower on his social media\nWho demonized the very congressman that I shot nearly killed on on their Web site and that's fine that's no problem they also inflamed or another left wing activist that went to\nThe family Research Council in Washington planning on murdering everybody there and throwing chick fillet sandwich is on their on their dead bodies because he's filled with hatred on the Democratic party created all that hatred how dare Dan cat the chick fillet say that he's in favor of traditional marriage just like Barack Obama\nHad a couple of years earlier and Hillary Clinton he got out of mind all that you know if I were in your standard honor\nNo honor is nothing no integrity I no sense of honor how\nIf they had children and I'm sure they do how can they how can they explain away I'm sure they're lying just like they do about everything but it's just the dance than they have they have no honor at all\nBut I didn't even know what honor is on her as an alien concept integrity is an alien concept the likes and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and [noise] and James Hodgkinson\nAnd uh and Alec Baldwin in it because they are going up and down the line now your your career army\nThat's correct I retired retired sergeant major yes or a and I'm ... you sound like you're kind of depressed about it tell you the truth no no I'm not\nSurprised at all in fact I'm I'm very angry but you know what I mean I'm going to go out there and then there is\nA Democrat at a restaurant because quite frankly you know I just well I'm a I'm a normal human being right to do anything like that it is absolutely unacceptable behavior\nAnd you know you're talking about the Clintons I was in a unit in Germany that their mission was Bosnia we were the first ones in Bosnia and like I didn't go first because I ... the U.S back to the states but you know every time he he said if you do that one more time\nYou know that

oval office without a high because of the amount of respect\nYes right jacket and tie yeah and then there's Bill Clinton in the Cuban cigars on the intern exactly yeah exactly my point yeah slightly different standards there no doubt about it there is no standard\nYeah well you're right I mean as a way we've uh uh\nThese the people the Democrats and they're not alone\nBut the the concept of honor of integrity of respect of you know that that they've they've abandoned civility or their their candidate the last time around Hillary Clinton has declared that there will be no civility in America and not from them not as long as they're out of power\nAnd if that's you know as a President Trump is right you don't get matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to a left wing mob that's
