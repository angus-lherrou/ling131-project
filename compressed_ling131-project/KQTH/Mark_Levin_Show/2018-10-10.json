Ramsey show\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up so\nI the last week I completed my debt free dream by over forty years over eighty four thousand a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nAnd uh well I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of saying I'm going out and thinking about just talking the money but also in back in time to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way what what are your thoughts on that\nRight job good job so I'm not sure you're going to say\nWell as of right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred show out of my salary try to say about twenty two twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred\nA month correct for how long well the ... at the house\nI'm looking I I get twenty percent on a down payment under fifty probably about at least\nTen months bare minimum that play around fifty percent but I did a year should be able to get that it can include bonuses impact your turn him such\nWell twelve months will be thirty thousand box and if you invested started thousand dollars which you don't have today but if you were to invest thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars\nYou don't have today but if you were to invest thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars\nCorrect okay I'm now we don't have ... thirty thousand dollars so it's like over the course of that year you'd have more like an average of Fifteen thousand dollars invested and so if you made ten percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars\nMhm okay and so if you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one year to put down on the house\nOr you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to put down on a house\nDoesn't matter box with all um Iraq\nThe point I was appointed as huge saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money um is the secret sauce not the investment\n\nBroker during this year Jordan is worth thirty grand mutual fund Fifteen hundred Jordan is the answer to our equation\nLiberty they

Dave Ramsey show Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve ...\nWell they have a long story short ah I'm I'm a doctor graduated from medical school just finished residency\nAnd I have about three hundred and eighty thousand in student loans mainly all from a medical school had Lon most plenty I was planning to do or the public service loan forgiveness program no\nPay it off however um that didn't kind of fall too with my current only me I'm just trying to figure out the will do a good way to uh to pay that off into so comfortably and death to become debt free is a financial burden\nOkay just for a future reference thirty thousand people have no applied for the a loan for the federal loan service for giving the public service forgiveness\nNinety six have been granted it out of thirty to out of thirty thousand it's a complete scam it's not happening\nThe government of screwed you show good I'm Glad you're not signed up for that so what is your income please God told me it's large\nIt all my combining I'm married so with my wife uh about two hundred and thirty\nGood [noise]\nOkay so you're gonna you're you don't get to live like a doctor because you're a broke Dr yeah\nYou're going to live like a college student okay help you out and start buying crap\n\nCan't answer that have you started buying crap bought bought one thing one what the car what'd you buy\nA car I got yeah\nYeah yeah now do you yeah what did you pay for it about fifty thousand okay you're a three hundred and eighty thousand dollars in debt you can never do that again I don't plan to\nCan never do anything like that again you're not only on vacation you're not buying a house you are a broke doctor\nHere's the thing you have this absolutely fabulous income and you are going to destroy your wealth building ability with that income if you don't clears that up and treat it like it's cancer and we're going to hit it with chemo and everything we've got\nAnd show that I Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less\nYou have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let you use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do it the other way but I'll tell you this your colleagues\nAre walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school dad for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease\nThe only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise\nSo that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor because I'm a broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going to develop another vacations\nSo you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans and clean up this mess because if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt urine it'd be so wealthy is going to be blinding\nIf you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just screw around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is whether it's in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm at this point where I could be giving 'em give like now ladder and my mom has been in a nursing home for ten years mhm\nAnd I moved here at the ... falls and if he is in a very very small ram and he's a large one and I was wondering what that is centered giving\nTo help get her ... her semi private ram and help pay for her cost of living\nTrue unless somebody giving 'em would it be tithing no but it would be giving yes um I don't have I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but um you have the money to do this or you broke her what\nNo I have the money to gas okay and you're you're out of debt yes okay\nAnd you have or how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred thousand and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income\nAbout Ninety thousand cool you're single I'm Single and what are you talking about spending here it will cost me about a thousand dollars a month okay\nThe twelve ran out of nine or ... and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't have any that you can keep investing so you retire with dignity and you can take care of yourself when you're in the exact same situation later right\nThat's what I Want to ... where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position and you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom's sure no problem with that OK absolutely what do they\nWant to be the right thing in in like you said about giving this I just wanted to make sure I live in the right thing found\nThink you are just wonderful gift and uh your your time to her and you know what a wonderful\nYou know act of love towards your mom and and and again you put yourself in a position you have the money to do that without bringing harm\nTo yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live and the gills like no one else very very cool Tony is with us Tony is in a while\nLater you can live and the ... like no one else very very cool Tony is with us Tony is in a Washington Hi\nTony how are you I'm well how can I help I was\nCurious why you advocate a money market accounts are low you become or like mercury on\nBecause you're emergency fund is not an investment it's insurance okay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid because if you're a transmission goes out or you lose your job you get your hands on it\nThe right of return is irrelevant it's insurance the ... of the things that does make you money to see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and\nThey got to set up in something where they get penalized if it comes out it's not liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do the bar owner four one K. long\nLike a four one K. along the ... the cash it out worse yet\nAnd they create a mess because I got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was like what they got stuck those are all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt creating ... insurance insurance is ... is an expense\nMoney tied up at one percent you would agree is an expense because it sucks it's horrible right of return\nIt could be invested in be making more\nBut that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there just as a barrier\nBetween you and the life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and this is insurance so a good question though that that's the whole reasoning behind that thanks for calling them open phones a triple eight\nEight to five five two to five yeah we need a rainy day fund you know why because it's gone on\nIn the ... are having an umbrella coming\nGotta get ready for this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about

I'm about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy sex addiction\nI'm spending just came out some money to do that all this month on prostitutes and strip clubs and um ... all the above and I don't know what to do I have tried everything I go to sex addicts anonymous\nAnd but I I I I Want to know what you would do in the situation I I've done well spent that money on buying a house in ...\nI I I I Want to know what you would do in that situation I I've done well I spent about how that money on buying a house in ... now and I'm doing well with that I'm not and that's been kind of it's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do about this how it should handle it what\nAnything else I even tried I have [laughter]\nHow old are you I mean twenty okay and I'm\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago I'm a he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money 'cause I found the child a wrongful death situation is um ... it it's a long story about your mom\nAnd I'm On a sheet out of the picture that divorce that go talk to her um right she yeah she to enter the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a a trained councilor um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years ago I was one hundred percent of the addicts end up broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy\nYour legacy your dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and he'd the help and\nFight to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that we see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and uh but gambling and sex are both just ... the the\nPornography is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet the access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives and the good wage and bad ways but the access in this case is causing\nExcess and it gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you're you're just left without any authority\nStructure as a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to stump you when you grew up your life\nYeah I I I Do have some family on my dad's side I'm actually a\nGood way but they know what's going on now so I Know\nThey were I had some problems going on like over a year ago a like a fact and that just a and I I never and whenever I tried it with them they kind of they were like a cheesy oh you're just being a ... and I never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the illusion that\nOkay everyone is okay but that's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK or no help but they they ... they're they're good but they just I don't know how well I Know that\nThat's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they ... they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half\nTreatment to treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be a half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for\nAnd there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know that um but\nUm [noise] I I I don't know honestly\nI think that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong [laughter] I can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um the saw the last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPast store oh counseling to go with your other counseling get with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people and um so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a book that or\nSynagogue I Know you're Jewish okay cool that's more effect then let's get with a rabbi dude\nGet the spiritual element of this going because there's a there's an aspect of that that goes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith and wonderful on by cause of the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in and I've got to put your structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a ... there's some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom\nAnd that will be hanging out with good people um that are lifting you up I'm\nObviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross\nSo um but that's you know that's the only thing I Know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I'd really lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's\nA group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you\nUm then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties and the other day\nIt is among those with him last night as a matter of fact and I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties and the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed that they need a group of guys you ain't got a what my friend Stephen Mansfield calls a band of brothers and your life a talk with you in these situations so\nI'm a man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you um I'll pray\nFor you to tell you that and hold on I'll have to pick up we're going to send you a copy of Mansfield book [noise] uh he's got a lot to say about this kinda stuff and then ... Mansfield manly men or whatever it's called and said look and you need some guys around who do that's what I'm thinking and and you need some spiritual wall had\nIt as a component to this this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nYou know what I've learned after talking to so many people who have been victims of ID theft they feel violated and they have a sense of fear an intrusion can be overwhelming\nExactly yeah well and I had never really heard of before and I didn't even know how to use a pod cast an even know what a pod cast was ... and so when Dale charge the flute at the time

[noise]\n\n... [noise]\n\nA good night's sleep is the foundation for good health not getting enough sleep can compound the facts of stress on the body not to mention lack of sleep contributes to premature aging in a way gang\nSleep is just as important as diet and exercise when I tried my pillow for the first time and started staying asleep longer and sleeping more deeply I knew I found a real solution to the sleep issues I'd been having like no more than ... the differences real unique to experience it for yourself\nTag went viral briefly mostly because of trolls posting names like serial killers who couldn't go on solo dates either then it ended when the navy vet in question tweeted that was my mom in quotes I respect and hashtags believe women [laughter]\nFirst of all I just want everybody to say believe the truth you don't have to believe anything that's not the truth right accusations is not a guilty verdict so you believe whatever people like don't you believe all women I Believe the truth\nDo you believe the truth or is all all you want is to feel good and that's like part of the world we live in as a feel good that you feel good when you feel good but it's so funny 'cause his mom did it right and he's got to come out like oh God mom\nMom mom mom\nI Believe in the quiet and he's like All right I Believe I Believe you know I Believe all women because that's what we have to do right like we have to ... to this you know hey what is the critical mass\nThing right like where the critical mass what do they were the masses think\nLike are they all on board as we we all believe now this is all like like like climate change we've got all believe it otherwise you're ... or any you know it and we're going to talk about climate change a little bit but it makes me laugh because it's like\nWe look around the room what is what are the masses because we're afraid of the mass right and then we we all kids the bunch you asked\nTo make ourselves feel good it's like people who are are a number Donald a couple of weeks ago making fun of the fact that all these comedians will just walk out and they'll say something horrible about\nTrump because they know it's going to get a cheap laugh 'cause everybody's afraid to ... you know we all what does everybody doing I got to go along with everybody is everybody going along with this oh good good good but he was a perfect example of the ... if you will this is John Mayer who's you know bodies wonderland we'll talk about some of the stuff he said uh but this is him the other night and I'm\n[noise]\nYou\nTo shut up shut up here's something for you ladies out there\nI'm gonna say at the ready for probably gonna yell at Fort Sill so hold on every all\nWomen like alpha males they're drawn to women do women like guys who were guys they like guys who are masculine the guys who are who who are men there you go period case closed they could ... you can pretend all day we can PS all day we can there you go I brought the

team and chair and yeah and in the end she's going to drop you like a sack of hot potatoes\nBoom boom\nBut we feel because of the masses and because people are afraid to say anything and again this is part of why Trump is where he is\nThis is absolutely why Trump is where he is because he is a reaction to the weird wacky politically correct climate where people just got sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired of pullout horrible they are and how bad they are and all of these things that Trump just goes out and he says stuff\nRight or wrong he says stuff and for a lot of people out there they're fine with that they're over this crap there over feeling bad and now we have to believe everybody right if a woman says it's got to be true no truth is\nAnd if the truth comes out that that person did something horrible then you'd go after them in the right way but if the truth stops\nBeing searched for the minute we accuse somebody put because it feels good it's always about the feeling part so that the it feels nice feels nice we should talk about this because it feels nice that's crap ... we got to stop this alpha male stuff\nCan idiots we need to stop but men being men\nRight there's nothing wrong with that we've gotten to this point in the world where we're like we're we we don't want to be met we don't want men to be a little boy you know little boys to to grow up to be big boys to grow up to be big men we don't want any of that we want everybody to be in ... it's not the way it is\nWe're trying to rewrite history we're trying to what we're trying to change you know we look back at science we go wow look at all the things look how we've all look at all these kind of stuff how do we evolve\nBecause the alpha was right they rose they continue to do so\nStronger survive things of that nature took place time over time now we're at the point where it's like we want to throw all science with her all believe once we're all this stuff out out of the window because it feels nice\nBunch of crap it really is it is and I was just listening to this and I thought to myself oh\nGod [noise]\nAnd if anybody tells you I Want to be an ally if we're not
