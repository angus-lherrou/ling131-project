I'm a I'm I'm Thirty years old\nI'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I put Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have some you know equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him in and kind of\nPicking out some growth stocks mutual fund to see what goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my\nDo I deal with this kind of pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know every any given month because about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now uh-huh um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shut shut draw towards my how he owns a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation than if you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is ... dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm because that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so what twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so uh about Seventy eight year is the household income yeah yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work you know\nI have a any tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the car does well\nI'll tell you that mandatory okay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small\nCard says well okay is that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I published it would put Fifteen Percent us at Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and\nFifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a high curling as I just open up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the old ... hundred for me I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to mark faster at ... dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll\nDrop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business so I don't care what you do okay I had an effect my income at all but I people have always asked me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there are fifty five hundred as eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put forth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got eight and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I'd just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and in what you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nUh at any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payments so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find and my budget I'm going to skip junk and on that house you're probably gonna that house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nA day I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up already\nSo I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't got a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty abnormal it currently with a U.S department of treasury on it as a result of having been a ...\nThat a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty abnormal it currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional from a service academy at three years ago and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly for the hundred Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up in a collection the count if I'm not able to pay the amount and fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWhile I learned you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can cause you got wonderful income you'll be different\nTwo years it's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start doing twenty thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go way really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou have to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nIs er so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either at the surf through in the service or you're assigned to the\nRecruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enroll for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge have to pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something wow well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nAbout everything child rearing financially and everything in a ... [laughter] yeah but it can happen it can I add guy so what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced\nMedication regime and and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nBut that never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself you know of of her check because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I\nRest my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom did this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of initially but if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to\nCan get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy yeah\nAnd I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again borrow ... you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen hey innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only did he medicated but she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want them just you know all the rest of their lives\nAs I Know I mean they had control their she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen uh as as a semi really mentally ill and she says she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nWell her ... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time so what did she say right now when they call her on the show you get nothing so she does take up the phone you know\nYou might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them 'cause you just you know because they're going to just I don't think\nI should be talking she should\nBe telling them to be either one of the I'm not going to long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're gonna ... her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating in trying to work our way through the death right well\nMy husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I aren't going to negotiate after two months\nOh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're going aren't\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any\nIll so they get nothing they get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight under their did she say look it can we work at a deal yeah or you know are they\nAll your Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement and full will do it and get an\nWriting and no electronic access to your checking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a film industry so you got a free somewhat rattlesnakes because they are you gotta really tender covering person here who's going into a rattlesnake she starts making some money\nYou got warm weather emotionally on there but you can you can give us a ...\nGoing into a rattlesnake then after she starts making some money you got to walk with her emotionally on this but you can you can give her the

of complicated I'm contemplating filing for bankruptcy and I just would like an objective opinion about whether or not that would be a good strategy for me or not\n... times are tough\nYeah I'm I recently left um my husband he was very abusive on me and the kids left um [noise]\nHe had me fired from my full time job I'm the house got foreclosed on he ran up a ton of debt on my credit card and my main\nUm so I have\nJudgment on my credit now a collection called out the while do um I like I said he hadn't been fired from a fulltime job all I can get right now\nIs a part time job that barely cover the expenses that the basic living expenses [noise] um so I have no way to you know start paying off the debt that he encouraged my name and\nI was like okay I'm Sorry I'm sure you've been through this sounds like you've been through hill I'm show when did you leave your fulltime job\nUm it's been a couple of years now or ...\nYeah I haven't been able to find anything else comparable to what I did um since then or\nWill you let me tell you you're emotionally not passed that because you're the way you're describing it it sounded like it happened yesterday\nYeah I mean it's you know we've been living in the abuse aren't you in your head\nYeah I mean my kids and I we we were homeless for a while we we've just stood there are a lot and I read he tried to get custody of them might have had to go to court trying to deal with everything and it's been a lot\nHere you know so basically none of these bills the foreclosure or all the bills that he opened up and your name have been paid for years\nYou bought Fifteen minutes and we'll give you everything you need to know during that first Fifteen pain during the first Fifteen weekdays at six and seven during his morning news with my ... ... for one month th\nOne she's usually ... mid term election destination station oh\nMajority of America was the lead you order Kimberly is relation Alexandria, Virginia\nI generally welcome Ramsey show\nDay thank you so much for taking my call sure a lot that blew my\nMind my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old he'll work the work in a steel plant mixing up four fifty to sixty a week\nUm about couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he had ... hey he's behind\nOn a lot of his bills head or somehow gotten a fifty\nThousand dollar loan from the bank and ah he doesn't have um a pension he gets about Fifteen hundred and Social Security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I Do provide him so I took over all the bills and I do provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that\nFor him to buy food and and what are you doing with this\nAnd how much are you able to put on the debts\n[noise] I'm putting everything\nWas a turning out to do everything on all that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month ... ...\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nOn the car eight on a house and she won a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead in a year right your ankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in the steel plant that I understand that right yes I was going to come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid I yeah my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\n... and that way you get free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh then the next\nStep is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency fund in place\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good well I'm asking is why a bank loan and I'm someone at his age the K ... you know four and a and it could be paid off and twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now that's yeah\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is\nYou know asking a banker review should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody this breathing or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOn ... inside of the industry is just stupid\nIs what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it's like no they would've offered the dog that credit card\nSo I mean and dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything he doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you can be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing today I got to require retirement okay I'm fifty two here about a year ... and I'm a ... and then I'll have a four weekends off\nOK I'm here about a year ... and uh I have mentioned that will have a while we all know what a good way mhm\nI quickly there are at sixty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before we take for we pay for the whole time and they ...\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to see other words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more than a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking out their four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh yeah definitely [laughter] yeah so you got to kind of gas and you got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... death I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nTo the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire Hi Todd how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nWell um I I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my

plan together okay and once you do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say with thousand dollars if you've already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars\nDo that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say that I was in dollars if you've already got money saved then we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except your home busting your debts\nSmaller

halls\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nI Will tell you guys would fill said but it was hilarious [laughter]\nI don't want to I don't want to it's not because of shape all that because the painful [noise] watching some of these protesters\nIt was interesting and\nYou know that was mentioned the Joe Manchin another one of those ones 'cause every these ones that you know Heidi Heitkamp is done she's twelve points behind it she was never the thought process if she was closer I tell you right now if it was a dead heat she would have probably voted for but she's so far behind at this point in time\nNot to know what she was doing that she's hoping that the Democrats throw throw in and help her out a little bit but mentioned lives in a weird world where he's in West Virginia a solid dead red state\nWhere he's a Democrat and he's gone against the Democrats on numerous occasions and and a lot of people like well if this was one of those things where maybe they throw into the wolf for doing this if he was the fifty first though to put them over\nI Would say you know at some point in time he may look at you and go you know what I'm going to start just I'm going to be a Republican or an independent but\nHe is a Democrat in a state that is is dead read and you know so each one of these senators that sway this thing today each one of them was in a situation where their their situation is extremely unique because\nThere for some of them they're they're in places where there you know outside of their little area there's not a a lot of friendliness going on meanings of Republicans and Democrats states are Democrats and Republican\nStates and they did what they thought they had to do and I looked at the way that Collins approach this today\nShe approached it in a way that had zero very little to do with the salacious ... other than scolding some people on the salacious missiles at all\nAnd uh and talked a lot about outside influence but also talked about him as a judge and a lot of things like that which I found to be very interesting and Mitch McConnell today wanted everybody to know how important\nThis thing was today the Senate as the opposite hunger advances nomination every one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes you ever cash in the Senate that\nHe said that on record saying and that's vitally important because some of these people that were going up against others and going in different directions you'd be surprised or some people are going to be primary out of this some people are ... absolutely are three two three five three twenty four twenty three that's three two three five three\nEight twenty four twenty three that as a tax line if you call that line you'll leave a message because it's a ... now that each and every day at this time we like to we like to make you laugh a little\nBit we do and I think we need a respite from all of this\nYou catch now that each and every day at this time we'd like to well we like to make you laugh a little bit we do and I think we need a respite from all of this craziness that's why we give you the urban word of the day\nIt's half of the urban word of the day I Am right now time to get a little more ... on the street I Can't understand a word you're saying\nOh kids I Love this one even those things are going well ladies you you you might know a lot about this you go out on a date with somebody and they're saying they're self employed\nA lot of times what that means especially in certain generations is [noise] you're unemployed you're just trying to survive and you're hustling and ...\nYeah I'm self employed I'm an entrepreneur oh you don't have a job that is correct [laughter] self employed ... unemployed is your urban word of the day thank you for saying that in dated urban claims about our understand you've that there were ... urban were of the day we damn stress shore cranium\nThe unemployment rate's actually the lowest ... it's all the lowest grade we've seen since Nineteen sixty nine so I think that that sort of an firms but it'd be other numbers where she liked out and that is that the economy is actually really healthy at the moment\nYes got to be as healthy it feels healthy people I talk to talk about you know what that this just it feels like it's motoring along don't get me wrong we are going to have a slow down and hopefully it's not another crash I don't think it will be but\nThe way we're spending and borrowing you never know but the ... this economy feels good and heading into a fourth quarter\nThat is huge and I think this year we're gonna have a massive force quarter\nAnd it is a it is it is the confidence is there people are looking for jobs don't have to worry they're finding jobs and people are having the opportunity to do essentially ghost jobs are getting job offers and they're thinking this sounds good and then five minutes later they get another job offer\nIt is it feels like a real best robust solid economy right now and and that's a\nLot of people that that that matters it does three two three five three twenty four twenty three I tried Benson show is your Twitter let's switch gears for a moment something I find very interesting yeah and it and you know basketball\nStarting NCA guys are starting to get ready for theirs and it is a crazy disgusting where we talk about politics let me tell you about NCAA Basketball how weird as Michael ... new book out called the last temptation of a Rick Pitino\nIs very interesting very interesting ... ... [noise]\n... adventures show [noise]\n\nWhen it comes to job hiring their job sites that send you tons of wrong resumes to sort through that's not smart you know what else is not smart using your relatives to fill in at work while you're looking for staff\nWhen it comes to life you know it's not smart making the lottery the centerpiece of your retirement plan but you know what is mark going to seep recruiter dot com slash Benson to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding you find them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands\nAnd we get him here we have maybe a good run to the sweet sixteen the final four maybe a chance at a championship and then I got to turn around and retool this program every single year and that's where it gets weird Rick Pitino is one of the best of bringing them on in\nWell he was although you know one of the interesting things isn't that Pitino wasn't the best recruiter he wasn't getting all the best players um you know to his credit\nHe achieved the final four is a national championships with guys who weren't lottery picks he wasn't getting the players coach K was getting or or um Calif Perry or Bill Bill self in Kansas um\nBut uh he apparently wanted one of the air with with Brian bow and junior and ah didn't play the game quite cleverly enough\nTalking about the game and and this is very interesting and for those people out there I mean getting college more as we look at it we think oh it's it's it is pure as this kind of like the Olympics the reality is there's so much money there's billions and billions of dollars in it\nAnd one of the places that millions of dollars comes from is the athletic side of the the Nike or Adidas\nThe Under Armour the and one because these kids they go out to recruit them young ages you who you're going to play for which a you team but you go into the night camped are you going to the ... camp it's vitally important and then a lot of wage they'll try to funnel you to certain schools that are you know that have contracts\nThat's what happened here you know\nUh I think a lot of fans think well they want to put shoes on kids in eighth grade or because they think\nHere you know\nUh I think a lot of fans think well they want to put shoes on kids in eighth grade or because they think that you know they they might be an end and this kid might be an NBA player and he's going to be a Nike a endorse or when it gets the NBA\nThat's a small part of the center of what they really want to do what Adidas Nike and Under Armour largely want to do is funnel kids to the schools they sponsor and then they are human billboards you know within this amateur sport\nThey are human billboards for whichever apparel they're wearing and that is one of the most cynical things so Louisville signed a just signed a hundred and sixty million dollar contract with the ...\nAnd all these kids are wearing Adidas stuff on the bookstore by the way you can barely find a book you know after you you know after you get through all the Adidas gear and that's true\nYou know at Ohio State with Nike or\nUnder Armour at at UCLA where the former football coach said now everybody's going no we're big time because we got this huge contract from Under Armour\nAnd I was like really you have seven Nobel Prize winners who came through UCLA you had John Wooden and it takes being associated with them Under Armour to be the time so everything is sort of turned upside down by the money and by the\nCommercial partnerships with a shoe companies\nTalking to Michael ... love and his new book which is amazing less than ... Rick Pitino story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball you know now we've got ... we've got all of this stuff money huge March Madness the whole nine yards we always wink wink nudge nudge as we all bleed the pools and played the brackets and stuff\nI think this is going to affect the this moving forward because the NCAA's holding on as for all they possibly can as far as their you know hey we're just amateurs their student athletes they get a free college ride but they see the money's at the coaches make that the NCAA makes and now you've got betting and how's that going to play into this\nWell the betting is just going to make it to ever bigger um you know the the\nKids who play these games generate money in ways we don't even think of the recruiting sites you know rivals dot com and uh you know whatever bleacher report runs and I I Can't remember all the names of them but they're all these\nUh betting all these recruiting sites that that run on\nFocusing on the decisions being made by Seventeen year olds well you know what these are big businesses\nThe the the several of them have been bought or sold emerged in the last few years for like three hundred four hundred million dollars at least so\nYou've got that you've got you know all the hotels and restaurants that benefit you know that are sitting outside the stadiums and now you're going to have legalized betting which means more batting and that's off the sweat and the muscle of the kids were playing the game so it just\nWell multiply the inequality that we have now and it's really intolerable you know you can't say after a while you were giving you a thirty thousand dollar a year scholarship\nGuess what you're generating forty five million dollars in an annual revenue at the University of Louisville which was the highest of any of the schools but you know tens of millions everywhere\nYou know like I ... and that's that that's the thing that's insane is how much money and I don't look I mean like this past weekend I watched Alabama destroyed the raging Cajun or Louisiana Tech or whatever was in football they're going to get their million dollar jak and that'll pay for the rest of their football season I understand it that it's a business\nAnd and that's that that's fine I got zero problems with that\nUh I just what I don't like is disingenuous by the NCAA that saying that hey this is this is not really business is all about amateur athletics when when you and I both\nWith that uh I just but I don't like is disingenuous by the NCAA that saying that hey this is this is not really business is all about amateur athletics when when you and I both know what's BS and the reality is the FBI had to look in this because the NCAA didn't want this stuff uncovered because they're they looked like they have egg on their face because they're allowing this stuff to go on right under their nose\nOr that is all absolutely right I mean as all or a smog sort of fantasy that that these are amateur so then I Will tell you that if you look\nAt the FBI charging documents on the indictments the FBI comes off as pretty naive because their whole case is\nSort of positive on the the FBI has uncovered a this these ... this wrongdoing and these characters who they have indicted were you know violating the spirit of of amateur ism and and you know letting these in these players be\nCommercially exploited\nAnd I'm thinking well okay but\nThe NC double a itself is is it commercially exploitive organization that didn't take\nA Christian Dawkins or was it was one of those charger or these with these characters to exploit them they're\nThey're signing up for that basically 'cause that's the\nWay the system is you know the ... thing is as always interest me because you'll hear about these guys and it doesn't you don't know it is it is it is\nWe don't find basketball players playing high school basketball anymore what travel team are you under the age you and some of those guys\nGenerate massive amounts of money they're making a quarter million dollars coaching AAU basketball and some of them end up getting jobs these colleges if they bring the right kids with them and I think it's not just the college you know or an NCA thing I think that it it goes much deeper that I don't think people realize that\nWell that's that's a big word of this problem the the grassroots circuit which is funded by the shoe companies and kids may play high school basketball but the hunting ground the recruiting ground is the ... circuit and\nCollege coaches love at first of all they're getting money from the shoe companies but it also means instead of and this was not even ... brilliant ... was the man at Nike who brought Michael Jordan to Nike and and pretty much designed the system I'm\nToward sunny understood as college coaches don't like going to high school games and getting on a plane and going to Dubuque, Iowa or wherever\nAnd seeing some six eight prospect compete against the uh five ten kid who is covering him\nSo let's put together something we're number one all the best players are playing against each other\nAnd just as importantly let's put it in Las Vegas and our land or when let's let's put it in places where these college coaches can come and stay in five star hotels and eat great dinners at night uh so that's what you've got now so part of the unwinding of this whole system\nIf you really wanted to do it would be to fend college coaches back to the small towns and high school gems and believe me they don't want to do it\nWhat what what what's the solution here going I must solutions based guy I I think at some point in time ... you've got to throw your hands up and say look this is a system we've got we've got to figure out a way to to do you do not so much keep it in and keep a disguise but let's just be transparent about it\nAnd figure out the best way of dealing with it but going forward what do you think the best solution is is it is it that no more one in ... those kinds of things would that takes some of that out of it just either you're going to the NBA you're going to college for two or three years how do we work around this\nWell the number one and done which I think it's coming only takes the top ten or twelve kids out of this equation or they can go right to the NBA so that does\nWell the number one and done which I think it's coming only takes the top ten or twelve kids out of this equation or they can go right to the NBA so that does a little but it doesn't do much\nUh the solution is to cut the kids in this in to a significant part of the revenue which means not we're going to take your stipend up from three thousand to ten thousand it means we're really going to pay you were going to figure out a way to pay you and\nThere's some people in the NCAA who who don't want to do that I think there are some who do want to do it and legitimately can't figure out how and I and I get that because there are title nine problems you know they only they talk about revenues sports you really talking about profit sports and that's men's basketball and college football\nSo can you pay them and not pay the women athletes is that right is it fair\nI really don't know they have they have to deal with that and then if you start paying people what if your quarterback who you you know paid as a freshman and sophomore what if he starts thrown interceptions and and somebody somebody takes his job you get caught his pay you're going to fire him\nOr are you going to pay your star point guard on the basketball team more than the scholarship kid who's who's like the night for theft player on the team these are all the things that you would have to deal with and they're not easy I think they're legitimately not easy and I think as much as a lack of a will", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "08"}
