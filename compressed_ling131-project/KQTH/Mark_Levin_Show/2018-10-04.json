video that functions as a wellness center ourselves off or not to you know God but financial coaching and other things to cook for physical mental and emotional health\nThought I was thinking about selling my house and buying that he'll play where I live upstairs and downstairs it'd be the wellness center might concern that that is that um will there be some sort of liability\nWell go ahead\nAnd get someone was to get hurt a lot I Know that can apply for an L. O. C. and they say go after if I were to go so they will go after the fitness but if I Lived in the same building what that there but I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue\nYou've got a couple of things going on here put chicken I Want to I Want to uh spend a little bit him on each of them first of all I'm probably gonna be state specific so you definitely need to look at the laws and your state in any type of regulations\nI'm you're going to have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it's where you live so you're you're going to have liability if someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if you have a product that type of things you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge him one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here's a traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have any idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller in a little sooner so I'll give you an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base in their off hours builds your brand build the demand you have no risk\nLike a terrifyingly so yes I Want to look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment\n[noise] Patricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was quite a lot I work full time and I think I'm going to Iran and on I was planning on civil and back from a practitioner and that way I'm making more money but it will help make up finding like business as well\nYeah I well I ... you can I just wanted to know that in fact be now is this this that piece of information plays beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you would try to go round open at my um I I just want to see maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three moms when I see if you can get a small group didn't pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tiptoe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too is can allow her to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean ... you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into the\nWell and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business and like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not it's you know and what you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside their calming and paying for you so don't feel like you have to have a location\nBefore you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow but you can out of your living room if you want to learn down the street and by the way you should [laughter] go ahead totally yeah yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the memory you are the business point people don't care I Know we're ... enjoy it to come in for you they're not hunting

choose home home movies have a fish from stuff that she had gotten from a bad uh when he had died um and\nThrough all the things we found you know we have a lot of old eight millimeters old VHS of stuff and it's like okay we have all this stuff\nUm I started to ... and I really found a passion for that that I haven't had in a piece for quite a while and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn into a great business I Love doing going forward\nA question at this point lead\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the middle of me or what is the business\nI'm converting legacy formats like a millimeter VHS wide film law that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nUm we bought a question I have is just um\nHow\nTo get started um\n[noise] um we bought a question I have is just a\nHow to get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I Would throw it properly and uh\nTell you what Bill question bill ... he's ready to go she can because we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we we help you out here's the thing about the great news that\nAh when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a Bible business idea\nYou just have to find people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve them and you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them to you're going to price for them you're going to create marketing language that speaks to them right where they are the best part about this bill it you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do\nIs you're going to build your business and you're gonna do it better\nAnd you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself\nIn that market a bell I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helps and we'll get we'll send that to you to try\nTo great plans to follow it and and here's this thing a ... a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting he finds these old things and you realize way I hate to\nIt and you are giving him the steps the book is going to walk into it but I Want to just had when they try it just tested on the ... the last caller here's why some passion should be ...\n... when you turn it into a better chance\nYou made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it\nAnd keep paying him into others have you need is done me tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped getting landing just you know water just doing triple eight eight to five five two to five coming up more of your questions about career starting a business [noise]\nDon't go anywhere\nYou heard me talk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million twenty six\nI'm going to say one quick thing let you go here's the deal hang on until the hubby gets back you know what I mean you've got to hang on and you can do it here we are in October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and of course he's going to were well known about the plan to get their\nQuick quick question Katie the contract jobs you're doing in addition to the full time is our jobs are those something you're running independently already or do they go through the main company was paying your salary\nSo they're different companies okay I'd like to see at two of them are kind of actually my own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that you contract work for\nPerfect they don't have that salary yeah\nThe reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can I run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me\nAnd you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken said\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways to your husband but in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand the client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting together interest\nOf other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person\nYou're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then when you decide to leave your full time job it's the next logical step where the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband has income so you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty per se\nWhere the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband had income so you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you know starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first of the year you probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job yeah\nAnd it comes down to a formula you gotta work days maybe step stays baby steps on the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way\nInto the tunnel is an important point can cause so many people feel like how cannot sustain this well you're not still January when you ... you know this is the first season and put my head down for a season that man had the rewards and skinny worth that things aren't\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\n[noise] hey how you doing guys I'm OK though I've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and ah I Love the field the

take care of people who are on developmentally disabled and work on being a girl\nAnd you may twenty two thousand dollars a year ... okay\nSo\nBasically I have an opportunity to locate from where I Am in Montana back to Boston where I'm from\n... and said well job would double my income mhm [noise]\nIn doing so I Would not be bringing my family with me at first you have the opportunity to say I'm Free with um\nDoing so I Would not be bringing my family with me at first I had the opportunity to stay right of free with my father and work mhm\nWhy would I Want with your family or with you\nUm affordability I Can't afford a move them I mean we're down even have a foundation to move out of dollars to start an offer to I mean right now I'm dealing with like negative cash flow ... does your wife work outside the home\n[noise] uh no she can't care at the airport is you have four kids okay yeah All right and do you own a home\nIn Iraq okay\nAnd uh so basically you get a loan your furniture into a U Haul and pull it across the country and be in Boston and get an apartment right\n[noise] um well and the long haul yes but short term I Would try a plane ticket wow load your wife up and go\nI I wouldn't have the money to put them on the part of uh-huh\nOkay so uh where you're going to be making twice as much though so how quickly would you be moving them\n[noise] ah well she's pregnant with our fair so\nThe thought process would be in the summer probably August after birth\nNo I'm not doing the I'm not leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the dad gum world and go live with your dad\nNot a chance unloading her up and moving dude as you can you can have your family help you a little bit I mean it won't cost much to get moved maybe the employer would give the new employer will give you an advance to get you moved into your new apartment\nUm there's a possibility with uh\nYeah you need a loaded up your family and get out of there\n\nBut you know not being with your pregnant wife while she's carrying what your fifth child you're in Boston and she's in Montana dude that is not okay [laughter]\nI mean you're not in the military or not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad choices now you need you need to scrape together a few dollars and go deliver some pizzas or something and uh for a month in and pile up you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you a U Haul and get your button gear\nAnd enroll loan over to a Boston and take that job or move in with your dad for a month with the whole dad gum crew over there if you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going to lay bringing your whole\nFamily and while your wife is ... no no\nNo that's not going to work out for you that's going to end poorly on diminish or you may links for calling in ban is one of those bands in Colorado Springs have ban how are you\nYeah you do\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and um we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide and art but they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysat\nI'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan that you know because I'm self employed and money isn't always there I Need to have oh you know two two months or so of income to fall back on in ... to to be able to make the budget that does your wife work\nShe does not she's a stay at home\nSo uh income to fall back on\nIn ... tip to be able to make the budget that does your wife work\nBut he does not she's a stay at home mother\nAnd so you're not make any money in the real estate business\nWhile I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year somewhere in there they are not having zero months\nNot any zero month or during the winter in Colorado there's um some months at a slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter than that I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you might get eight thousand dollars a month average so I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway\nSet some aside but we're not going to call it an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it an Illinois valley account\nThe hill and valley is the volatility of your income the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow a analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you have in some zero months but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues and charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn given in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are than okay set some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I had a great impact on changed my life five years ago I'm getting I think you\nAre currently uh I I got a critic question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my um do you get a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture I was I was making an average salary for what I did I went to a competitor I was\nMuch more you making um I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year what do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year when your questions what\nI make my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really really\nOpportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people a start up [noise] um I think it would be a really really interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of walk by passion for my work and um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse than the marketplace this idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with so maybe that particular company cafe but if you want you could probably find somebody with a decent culture and how you what's your worst that's what it amounts to\nThis is that Iran [noise]\nDid you know ... when it comes to life insurance in protecting your family that women are more likely to be on insure or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nI don't personally have an account right now a credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts and our a personal accounts are all have local\nUh read our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller to set kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talk to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charge you for most of the services and this day and time their online offerings their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated or not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but\nYou know ... you know in most of these cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing\nJust the same how can I help\nAll right well thank you and your staff you're doing it it's a blessing you um how it'll be needing a life saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I ah I should continue funding NHL stay with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks here of course they just put that extra money into a Roth IRA her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year the company I don't know who you can put you can oh they're matching a couple hundred bucks a year yeah ...\nOkay so the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what is it\nI think the liver ooh I got ... the so yeah ... fortunately if you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know [laughter] oh okay yeah it's it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay yeah I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to yeah retiring early you know if I\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you you got to have the cash in your age I say or somewhere else in and investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um and I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nI think I'd be on cobra or\nTire 'em and I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is a guessing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably half\nNow and so I'm thinking we're going to time retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the ... cover only last what two years or something\nI'm always you can keep that indefinitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of those I don't want to\nTime that poorly a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year into that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what your doctor will\n[noise] um\n[noise] ... yeah ... or ... whatever the ... on the ... year\nOh now H I say that health insurance or no fun\nI don't know the edge essays are health savings account that is attached to a health an H essay health insurance policy that is a ... policy\nIt it depends uh depends on the policy I pick a cheater six to nine nine thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nAnd that would be six thousand happy hour shutdown early on that yes and I don't touch it until I you know pretty dire\nYes here's why how when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you\nKeep your health insurance in place and you've got this big juicy health savings accounts sitting there in an odd use mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as it can there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're\nWhatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on it no penalties at sixty five and so\nYou're going to want to build that up and you know he's not going to become sort of what you don't use you can use for retirement\nAverage sixty five so I I Would love that up knowing that you've got this coming down the road [noise]\n\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do I live um in in our city\nWith
