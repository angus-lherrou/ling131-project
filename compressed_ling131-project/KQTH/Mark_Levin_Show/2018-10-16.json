I'm ... the American constitution doesn't apply in India\nAnd uh and I actually got um a teachable me out and got in trouble yeah I did I listen to the principal and the fact that the principal one day when I make it to the United states you wouldn't be able to do that to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay and now people are trying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform\nTo something using a social pressure but not all okay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought\nThrough you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom that is correct\nDrew you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom that has to stuff\nAre all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by\nThings that you have or aware or not impressive people when you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and so um the very people you might attract by having some bling\nBy having some jewelry or some watches or the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge\nPrice to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character and um the uh ... and ... the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you ... you and so forth um and so\nYou know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character in our judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you're driving a car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something what needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have and and manage them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became wealthy now they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me and so I\nI don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of this year is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that that'll come what are you doing for a living I'm looking id in IT of and what do you do a developer you're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to nice when work rush\n[laughter] Saudis in order to meet you sir if you've got quite a story brother quite a story Weldon thanks for stopping by\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five ... this is the Dave Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up [noise]\nUm I wanted to ask if I should say my tax come here and she reported off information um on our fending paying taxes and everything without being being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars in penalties yeah mhm not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes and penalties yeah okay I mean it showed like a percentage on the information mhm well that\nFalse information she lied intentionally and you get groove that\nYeah why would you do is\nGuess to get back my money I don't know like Frank fishy claim that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own\nClaims that we were at home I'm from mileage for this\nAdam business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't only cheaply claims that we were at home I'm from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird I mean does your husband have something to do with this and he doesn't have hit that we could you know I mean they just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have an cars you don't have a knowledge that you don't have\nRight now we have the church but you know trickle down okay so there with no there's nothing in them the documentation that image of anything about the church that we have our uh our number that they haven't won the number of them\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one ... see three as a venture list that you're being paid uh outside of the church now you know you don't do speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side\nNo everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nYes and even for the church we don't make any money for that tried to get on and we both work independently another company\nAnd I say you have your by vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I don't I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing that someone would do this just out of the blue eye is not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication\nAnd so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you've signed the tax returns though didn't you\nKnow everything that they've you know you know but you had to see the tax returns\nYou you you didn't land allow someone to send in tax returns are due to the sea Shirley\nHow high you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and asked them\nI my guess is the most you could hopefully get back will be the penalties the taxes you already oh and you still owe the penalties are due to them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back I don't know as soon as you\nDid you know that if you combined the data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal info compromised or act over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had\nMoney on still um we had my mini van was paid off um had in my hands now well over two hundred thousand miles um\nWasn't worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happen to own one of the Volkswagen diesel\nWas candle and\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do that by Dr ... bet and we were planning to keep it but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get the body back and got the cash settlement\nAnd got rid of the payment and the position that would put us in it it actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six\nMonths and thought about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back from what I've been doing and he said he would buy us FDU\n'em for Christmas and allow us to do the program at home we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would text pets but not today to talk to him and I was a little nervous because of the car was kind of pets and I didn't think he'd\nGo any man that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the minivan but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like most and I told him about my spreadsheet that I'd made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this\nUm\nI thought you were you were ready to\nYou are sick of this Oh absolutely you know and then you come home when you go to will be Schumer city\nBut we didn't end up going to what we did it um through the program at home home study yeah our church is an hour and a half away is Ron Ron\nMountain nowadays you can watch it all online different\nHome study I Gotcha yeah our church is an hour and a half away and run run\nNot now nowadays you can just watch it all on line but it is different than yeah very good you guys want is key to getting into that you made already one thousand and Eighteen months ...\nAdults like in the world they paid off alone as another ten thousand and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one month yeah yeah All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt and you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um I Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication to\nWhere both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than in the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything mhm which she she did a as good a job as I could possibly expect\nExactly what she was by herself\nBut she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how was being done exactly where we were I knew small numbers I did not have the big picture and you know guys being visual creatures the disparate she gave me the big picture and the color coded clarity\nSo it's definitely a huge last summer the control when ... got involved but you gain um someone else's shoulders to help carry the load right\nYes yeah it became amazing actually what happened with pat with this was beyond fiber gasping because\nHe got on board that what and and God on if we had a huge impact on this because he was told there'd be no more extension and that was back like just a few months before we started at man I'm about to\nBe about a year into it\nHe gets a call he he was home during one of his trip and he gets a call from work saying they just got back three weeks before but they wouldn't need him to come back a month early and he gets off the phone and he's like or do I do and I'm like\nI don't know you want to go back and he's like what what would it deal with our inside we were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating\nAnd I'm like you know what if you do this\nWe can be out of debt in June\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like wow I didn't get dropped on board and he he actually told them that he extended for the the month you know if they would give them an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee a ticket at all paid off in that time\nAnd congratulations you guys were so proud you got a copy of Chris organs returns from our book for you that is the next chapter in your story to be millionaires and outrageously generous as you're going on\nAnd go ahead and I say one other thing that you got ten seconds was um one of the big kids for me was um setting an example for our kids are teenagers and I thought they made a huge difference that\nPatrick and stuff on the eighty one thousand dollars paid off in Eighteen months\nMaking one told me the one fifty five gallon down let's

supposed\nTo go that far and it was more guys that were like these guys are new bees and they weren't really like they didn't quite understand and they just went through like now it's up to Trump to figure out what what the deal is\nWe're working with Saudi Arabia with her and they don't want to figure out what\nAnd they want to know what happened also so a lot of people are working on\nNow the question is pretty simple what do you do if you're Trump\nLike if you're a Trump right now what do you do because people are going to be looking at you at this moment in time and saying All right now do you value human beings life and there is a difference between a human being and a person of power I Know it sounds horrible they're all\nPeople but this person had influence like you and I don't have in a in a place in in the world that at times uh needs a voice and needs influence and seeing the kind of be above the fray and it was\nIt's very interesting so what do you do if you're Trump right if you're from the question is going to be by a lot of people because you're seeing tons of actors I said this today to to somebody it feels a lot like this is apartheid\nIn South Africa you're seeing businesses you're seeing all kinds of of celebrities and people including the WW eat which apparently a a poll out today of what was supposed to be their second big thing in in ah in Saudi Arabia\nYou're seeing a lot of of people take notice because this right here\nHas huge ramifications know met a guy who is so influential in a part of the world where people don't have a voice and he and many ways was their voice over two million Twitter followers and a part of the world whether it's probably only ... million Twitter followers because of the freedoms that they lack\nAnd the opportunities that lack and this guy\nKind of was that guy and now they take a step back and they're looking around and this doesn't make them look good at all so if you're a Trump you have to ask\nYourself the question what do I do and it's tough it's tough\nYou don't want to lose all those you know billions of dollars that are floating into American companies you don't want to lose the potential growth in businesses and or people keeping their jobs but you do need to send a message and what does that message going to be in is that going to be enough for everybody and how's the rest

Benson shows your Twitter you can tweet at us\nFor us to talk of we're going to get into recession we're going to have these things this is going to happen I'm like you guys know that's how bad our recession will be I don't know but I Will tell you one thing\nWhat's coming in the future that isn't being talked about needs to be talked about you know twenty thirty forty years ago you come out of college you have very little if any debt whatsoever\nYou could start to get on with your life you could start making money and you could take that earnings that you had because of that college degree and you could put that back into the economy we live in a different world now kids are coming out with hundreds of thousands upon thousands of dollars\nOf massive debt that is turning into hundreds of thousands of potentially millions of dollars in debt\nOver years and instead of putting that money back into the economy like buying homes and things that come with homes what they're going to be doing is essentially trying to survive and that\nIs going to put a huge dent in our future economy\nOn student loan debt I'm I think it's important that people will be able to borrow to make what maybe the most important that's one of their lives which is in their education\nA so overall I think borrowing it to invest in yourself this is something we should we should foster somebody to a couple of important Covey as first it's very important that people understand the nature of the nature of the borrowing and the risk if they're taking in and ... and the possible payoffs and that sort of thing so that they make informed decisions\nInformed decisions are huge and there's a reason that they need to make informed decisions because I've got friends who graduated college twenty plus years ago they're still paying off their debts\nAnd their debts are nothing compared to their kids debts and there soon to be kids get to I mean these debts are massive\nAnd when you have the government stepping in saying we're going to guarantee all these loans you can't get rid of these laws all of a sudden you are making a house payment\nRight for your education which is going to strike it's going to put a huge\nBeing a house payment right for your education\nWhich is going to strike it's going to put a huge dent in what we're doing as we try to grow our economy your kids coming out with three hundred thousand dollars in debt\nAnd they're looking around and they're getting a job and they're making a thousand dollar a month payment or eight hundred dollar a month payment on some of these things and they're gonna be paying these things off for years and years and years and money that should go into the economy because that they would become a a productive member of society it's gonna be tough\nBecause that's going into education and when you get the government involved the way it is the kind of money that they're guaranteeing these kids they're taking it out willy nilly and on top of that they're taking out other debt to be able to live while they're trying to go through school and it is going to eventually explode\nThe second thing is um I think alone among all kinds of dead or we don't allow student loan debt to be discharged Yvette right or the um I'd be at a loss to\nTo explain why that should be the case so it's something and it does its fiscal policy this is something for you and not something for the fed but we do see is in fed research shows and other research shows you do start to see\nLonger term negative effects on people who can't pay off their student loans that hurts their credit rating it impacts the entire half of their economic life\nAnd that's something to think of it we may have a lost generation or two of people who aren't going to be able to afford to live the way that their parents lived at even a fraction of the way that their parents live until their parents eventually passed away and leave them stuff\nTo get themselves out from underneath this giant enormous burden of that now granted they took it on themselves\nBut do you think about it if an Eighteen year old\nComes due today and says give me a hundred and fifty thousand dollar loan you're going to be like\nShut up never going to happen\nIf an Eighteen year old comes you did say I need a hundred fifty thousand alone because I Want to go to school you get a basket\nWeaving liberal arts degree from some college that's going to adventure going to come out with a degree after four or five years on top of that extra debt that I was you know taking credit cards to pay for these kinds of things of life that I wanted to lead just to survive\nYou're going to be like oh that's fine but what it does long term and when you think micro right now it doesn't affect them I think the macro\nSo that's the that's the public policy argument for us to do something about student loan debt and the and the way we structure a higher education financing my question for you is do you see this as a macroeconomic risks\nIt will over time it's not something you can pick up in the day that right now but as this goes on and a student loan continues to grow and becomes larger and larger than it absolutely could hold back roads\nYeah and I think it's going to and I think for all the talk of the new housing bubble that's coming in a lot of these other things over a trillion dollars in debt the kids and and young adults and even older adults boomers have a ton of it that it's still sitting out there that is not going to be able to be discharged nor should it be because why would you let somebody do that\nBut the fact that you're willing to go out and say you know what I Need this degrees so bad\nThat I'm willing to spend three hundred thousand dollars and even if it's a hundred thousand dollar loan think about how long it's going to take you to pay that off heat is massive\nAnd what it's going to do for us in the future I don't think we're talking enough about it but it's coming it is three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had meant that shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you a Mac ...
