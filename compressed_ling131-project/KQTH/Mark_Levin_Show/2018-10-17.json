[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIs on the line in Denver Hi Caitlin how are you [noise]\nBut we're not having a hard time finding that in my lab played in the industry as it usually you have to hire so how can we get is hoping I can branch I mean the only way that we can actively fight reliable and get people to be a part of the law candidates that\n\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people well we did a health care um that are good I mean people\nAt a party there hasn't been reliable\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people\nWell we do have that and if they have their own ... well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own businesses\n[noise] ... yeah okay\nWe're we're trying like me but um that I have black and I know these were financially and so I don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the time they would rely people run around with good reliable people yeah\nAnd most of the time do fishes run around with due to ... so usually when I'm looking for good reliable people I look around other good reliable people now I could be that you look in some of the other trades and you know one electrician that's a good person or Trump carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who did they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring on to the job\nA part of the problem they got as you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so everybody's got work even do fishes\n\nAnd your has your husband's got my working hand on maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage or when you've got a construction boom always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know an example in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that is a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now in most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we'd go on like you've done websites you've gone on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly\nGreat developers no other great developers bright painters now where the great painters or somebody is not a developer but has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry does a great person will no somebody's developer and send them our way\nAnd of course you're going to pay them\nAnd um pay them well\nI'm a ... paying ... doesn't make them anything except the well paid ... so you you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people ah sixty four percent of people that joined our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want them to work here in another area now we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but how that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds Roma thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys\nAnd so you know you just got to find out find your thoroughbreds and and people on in the community\nThe steak dinner in it for you guys send you a good guy you send him a steak dinner you send him much sooner ... him and his wife through scripts or something because it's worth it\nTo get somebody in there and you know being being good that way and I'll tell you I'm going to send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books that have written the last two years and it's from a friend pat Lynch you only it's called the ideal team player and the ideal team player is three things hungry\nHumble and smart hungry humble and smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in any position in any organization in every trade and every organization has some people to qualify other high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people than you really a brand differentiated yourself from the other people in your marketplace so hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will send that to you\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five\nOr ... is with us in Wilmington, Delaware Hi Lucia how are you\nHi there thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm new at center and I ... and they have to put my question actually about the four oh one K. profit sharing with my former employer I Lived it over like you suggest into a rut roll ever IRA\nAnd then I got a statement in the mail yesterday basically there was a other section where the fees or over three thousand dollars and by further looking into it they're called fortune for future face\nI'm In there for eight different finds I'm kind of confused of every three thousand dollars of my money\nHow much money was in there it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars\nI don't I'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nThan looking at um it's a ... with eight different names and then it says forfeiture is and then it has a bunch of negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars\nThat sucks yeah so I thought especially when it was only you know a small four one K. to begin with\nYeah really um did you roll it was a smart Mr pro\nI rolled it over and so ... previously on another irate I had already opened so you don't have an advisor I don't okay um\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer to your question I've never run into that ... the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company your former company the mutual funds are high the mutual funds or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros and your area and just see if they will answer that question for you okay maybe they can tell you exactly what happened at least you'll have the mystery solved since Dave Ramsey too stupid to answer that question because I just don't know the answer\nThe I just don't ... I'm Sorry I Wish I did write Joel is with us in a Decatur, Alabama Hi Rachel how are you\nI'm great how are you for taking my call\nSure what's up [noise] so my\nEmployer is going through open enrollment or our health insurance benefit and I'm kind of on the bed and I'm hoping that maybe you could kind of helped me job\nUm they've introduced a new high deductible a program with an H essay which they will be contributing to and I'm trying to decide that I keep my traditional the the a plan or should I jump on board with this high deductible plans\nOn how much is the premium on the ...\nThe premium all the eighty to ... pay period they calculate to about Twenty one hundred a year and what about the other one the other one will be around\nFour hundred and Twenty one hundred show Thirteen hundred dollar spread and cry and how much does the doctor will only at\nOkay they won the ... it'll be four hundred per individual or the ... and for the high deductible Thirteen fifty per individual that there is a twenty seven hundred or the family\nYou know and how how uh how old are your kids [noise] and my kids are pending Thirteen are there any uh ongoing illnesses partial by prime [noise] I was offered a young lawyer to duck double [laughter]\nHow often do well I'll say like why am I right now we just hit that adopt a ball and one of our family members emerging that hit ... years as I said\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your Thirteen hundred savings versus the extra extra risk you're taking were fairly healthy we don't usually run through the ... so the hot adoptable lower premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it [noise]\n\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family\nHas debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial\nNeeds that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace those stay at home parent\nWow yeah my hero yeah how do you do that or do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you got to start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giant stuff at the end you know\nAnd I I Would add to that or the giving and the ... um well it's really court I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boys what we're given what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that then I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality anymore wearing taking away it's we've learned how to Liz\nHave joy within our means and once you hit that point it's um\nIt just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nYou know so you have a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage approximately when you started this and um it didn't seem real that would ever get paid off somewhere along the line you looked up and said\nAh this is going to work and they started like you were writing downhill wants to the climbing up he'll you know what I'm Talking to the point do you remember where that was in the mortgage balances like when you got it down to fifty or you got down to a hundred or when was that you went at gun we're really doing this\nBut I think it was last year I I went back to work for one year and\nAll of my income went towards the mortgage because it was about fifty fifty thousand laps and we just just piled on every month it was like you just kept counting down month by month we're going to make it and it was it was off\nIt but you wouldn't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculated knew it was just for a year now if I can do this for a year were done by some in for a year\nYeah and you can embrace a year of pain so by then you knew it was really going to happen it was real it was before that that you believe that yeah I I mean we were under water on her mortgage for about three four years that anything for\nMe it was like when we uh oh it as much as what the equity was um then it's like started feeling you know we couldn't breathe and and\nNow at least we can sell it and get out of around right on okay\nAlright and good very good this is good
