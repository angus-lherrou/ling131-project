that's most of the health has gone to resorts Panama City\nDave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nWell I'm\nI'm preparing for the decorations and I'm I'm not quite sure what to do with my dad as they say they claimed my student loan debt\nOkay a separation and I'm from your husband John Harris\nYeah sorry about yes and my husband okay and um\nSo uh you're preparing for separation how long have you been married\nAbout twenty two years\nOh my goodness it must be bad\nIt it just that we are a ... not on the same\nPage anymore I'm and other things but ah with money as well and that's just a case just or something I just I don't want to go on land\nMhm have you been seeing a marriage counselor\nThat I think he's not going to\nHave you gone yeah\nOK please do that for you even if he won't go I okay I think it\nWill give you good I'm emotional information twenty two years is a long time and you need to\nHave somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this and or give you some in maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question\nI have a friend of mine that teaches divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns a marriage into a business transaction\nAnd the so it it comes ... real quickly the emotions are carved often shut over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes a very transactional\nKind of thing at that point does that make sense\nYes and so a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or somebody else but your student loans are going to go with you [noise] um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nUh uh it they took out\nOkay All right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything you can to save a twenty two year investment uh him with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year\nAnd you'd you'd look at your student loans how much their mom and dad have you got\nA better Kim I'm Sorry it's sixty thousand oh my lord okay [noise]\nWell how would let them know that this is going on hardship to furrow until you get\nPast ah what else whatever else was going on here okay now do you own a home yeah\nSo you get past ah what else whatever else is going on here okay now do you own a home\nYeah what's it worth it to migrate out what's out on it a high tech savvy family\nOkay so no equity there to amount to anything or is your car paid for yeah as his corporate for now okay is your name on that loan yeah good okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd there is one that I have to let him ... ... I'm Sorry\nYou refuse to let him yet it all better than that glass closed that account today\nJust completely closed the credit card\nIf he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car [laughter] period and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house I have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes an Mexico drip puts it on the guard\nAnd you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance\nYeah good close okay the ... does your checking account both names on it yeah\nOkay sure your money is separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nYeah yeah\nOkay I wouldn't accept her mortgage probably as both are names on okay so here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south ...\nYou can't stay there yeah\nUm so the house that needs to either be refinanced\nTo get your name off of the mortgage or sold you cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb and people often do that in a divorce they often do that\nBut just you know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car you're checking accounts are already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt I'm ... does he have any big savings or investments or do you and for one case\nAnd not big now how much am I Am I Am\nA ten thousand mhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he had um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay as far as what answers income [noise] ah it's around Ninety thousand okay\nIn most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and we're going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you gotta mess on your hands\n[laughter] okay no I'm not here\nSo I'm unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans are going to get the cheapest department you can get you going to stay debt free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize the after the separation which will lead to divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together\nOkay but\nYou pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength\nAnd you pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially um and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now\nBut let's get the other side of cash but but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools to get by by wake up call maybe the two you sit down with a coach a counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I that would be best for everybody involved I'm assuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concerns are addressed\nAnd I'm sure that I'm sort of like a pretty long list but um ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who cannot sit down with a can walk me through\nUm\nOr the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um 'cause he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor\nThat's really experienced and why isn't\nA godly council a will help you in that situation and I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you\nIt'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five to to find you jump and we'll talk about your life and your money\nInteresting data that just came out on the article I read on the air about marriage\nAnd um [noise] the men who are married and make more on average about Fifteen Percent on the men who aren't married women make twenty five to thirty percent more that are married then are married don't know why that is exactly but it's an interesting discussion\n[noise] this is the day Ramsey [laughter] [noise]\nListen operators if you want

just you know it'd be nice to have an ice ring and you can get another ring I mean there's just stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nClay and hate I mean sweet but dumb well you know right yeah I agree\nSo but I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and ... back and a little bit better you know in order to you all the ... are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's a big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that ten percent on one of the keep the ring or not so young and so this ring is not going to make or break you get out of debt plan one way or the other but this behavior will\nAnd this lack of being on the same page will so you know what let's just talk this through in and make sure we're on the same page and then you guys decide together what to do with the ring and I don't know I I\nIt just represents dumb and so I'm not ever going to really be able to enjoy it\nIf you are because it's just in violation of where are you thought your whole family was heading\nAnd it's like we just kind of you know it's if\nYou guys are just too old to do that kind of stuff

recently about three years ago um started doing if you think we are we ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching\nA my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um there were a bunch of life insurance policies that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ... Ben I'm and the question that I have is\nHe put her in and in New Jersey about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars in the annuity um and then the other end up like Peter and back then and they've been growing a little bit here and there\nUm but the question is the annuity recently we hit the five year mark and a heater advising her to pull the money I started that in which I think is a good idea however the question is is that\nShe should have should have had that money in fact it initially at the beginning of the uh time you know and put up putting putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month in retirement and Social Security but she doesn't need the the draw on the annuity at all you know and he knew that at the beginning of the time\nYou know well yeah you're right that makes me question and other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you I'm but I I I and I am I personally would have put all of it into good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent car the paid off she has the wrote that\nThe euro good good okay and how much is investments total this three hundred plus\nI'm yeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the investments if you're at the house another fifty to sixty onto the hundred there\nHow old is she\nUh she thinks she just turned sixty okay All right cool because she didn't write out because you're not like an an old ... year old ... on our way out I think right out\nGood I'm feeling better and fifty seven to hear you say that so um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out today either a\nAnyway [laughter] or at least at the mouth to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's um\nIt's not it's not like you put her in whole life policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean that just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity in the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nAre there okay um but it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her then if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you've got the right to ask a question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he goes up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move to anyway\nSo you do that with any financial people are people that are advise you own technical\nWhen they start getting like ... like you have to oh them an explanation instead of us versus them move on\nInsurance lady gets the attitude it's Tom move on right near state plan are just too smart to sit down and explain something to you then it's time to move on so you know you just you gotta get folk and you're going to have the heart of a teacher so if he if he can walk us through what is thinking was\nThen it's time to move on so you know you just you gotta get folk in your corner they'll have the heart of a teacher so if he if he can walk you through what is thinking was as you get comfortable with it then you stay with him and continue to invest in a row struck mutual funds would long track record which which is where I personally what about [noise] this is that I ...

phones a AAA eight to five five two to five books is with us from Pensacola, Florida Hi Brookes welcome Ramsey show Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nServe thanks for taking my call uh my wife and I were moving out to a San Diego station out there or we have to pay for a house here in Pensacola and um I Know you normally say not to buy\nA house if you're in the military um but uh make good money last two times have done it and uh I Am uncomfortable having my whole network\nAnd the um [noise] in the stock market basically 'cause we'd be looking at the house about three hundred fifty K. or you know we have three hundred and Fifteen cayenne retirement already in\nBut I Would have to take a two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there and also you know I don't want everything in the stock market also don't want everything in one house ... going to live their short time and I wanted to know your buddies\n[noise] um I don't have a problem with your not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord\nUh we have it on the market I I I Am going to cash out of this now suddenly they're gonna guy how well their cell phones they pulled out three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch up my non retirement investments uh you know at two twenty five ... now I can afford something up there and how much do you have in on retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. retirement so you're talking about a half million dollar house then yes or what's your household income\nOr about one eighty okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in\nThe military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough to sell it and make a profit and also\nSometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible\nAppreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes or I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and on retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing\nUntil I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash a non retirement cash and money from this other home and it goes up to seven hundred and when your salad you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military\nThen San Diego that's about the ... I mean Hawaii ... Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper than San Diego I think we all agree to that\nSo if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does that make sense yes or the\nIt's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non returned my cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the foreign hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nAnd non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing\nFrom a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long you're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nIt's not for that long you're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nUh but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI I own my own business and I'm a try to figure out how not to be a crime and under orange is the one I'm ... years old but ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you know I knew I start or retirement and I guess I\nDo you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payments you have more money\nFreed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA band around a lot I average probably right about a thousand only\nOkay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and how old are you\nI'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no good for you or you're single okay okay does your wife work outside the home yeah you're a nurse what does she make\nA right about that and get all kinds of All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that's grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a thorough three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do a Roth IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just 'cause you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else said do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your long term investing in your ... in your Roth IRAs and if you want some

insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership\nOwn country [laughter] so yeah that that was the\nAt least in some countries [laughter]\nSo yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurt but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right there so you really have been doing this ... broke out and then the last year or kicked down about the time you saw the light at the end the Donald income comes up ... yeah I mean what what was the hardest part of this for your cars six and a half [laughter] I'm good\nI'm I think for me the hardest part was\nI'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see the hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper or either to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is it worth it and um\nSo I think when we paid off our first student loan um that was just such a victory feeling for us um so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kinda flow out wherever I'm to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to the\nYou know I think for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know the world we live and just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying the nice things and I'm just constantly you know tall yourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nHas been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can live like no one else and I really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted\nTo be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so\nNear free you know those are the ... last three hundred pounds [laughter] it really does because he has a lot of doubt yeah it's pretty incredible ... well I Know it was a long time and a lot of sacrifice was worth it Yes sir yes that was real back into no no no\nNo we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow I'm we're on babysat for well at the beginning steps to babysit for but we're wanting to save up to cash flow for a minivan\nLiver none I'd say that but during the world ... changes you're going through his good\nGood for you guys like well congratulations to you have more church leaders are more detractors as you went along um\nWe had a lot of cheerleaders yeah we were um really supported by her family and our friends especially once we started getting the ball rolling and paying off dead it was kind of just people who are in this belief that we were able to pay off so much and um\nAnd at the same time he went to the big things for us with our journey was um being smart with our money especially all the extra income that was coming in and things like that but we also wanted to still I'm available lord in use our money for him and so\nI'm a lot of you know for the first few years a lot of our money was going out not towards that end we failed okay with that and so that's just part of our journey for people to not be afraid to still be generous while you're on baby step to even if it's a huge lump sum because the lord bless us in so many ways when we um\nI mean we've kept both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another car payment we're at the point to where we literally it was we were outgrowing our car like with the car seats\nAll right my cars like eleven years old and they don't want another car payment we're at the point to where we literally it was we were out driving a car like with the car seat he couldn't even put it back all the way and I'm like sitting out that we're getting a very hard\nAnd that so probably why stories my parents they blasted us and gave us they're paid off as TV oh wow yeah so um you know that's just one of the main you know blessings that and and you know where it's given\nThat given to you they give it the grandkids
