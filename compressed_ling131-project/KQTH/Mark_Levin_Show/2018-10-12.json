fine good how can I don't I was\nCalling because I'm a fulltime and about a year and lacking I'm part time ... how my income is low and I happened to Iraq on quite a bit of credit card that over the past five years to turn a horrible spending habits\nAnd um lately I have than now extricate out loans to pay down on that credit card\nDebt and no one knew that law that are in church or school yeah I'm up together right now I got about fifty nine thousand dollars in debt I'm forty seven and student about Seventeen I bet it in a car loan and then I Am talking and credit card out\nMhm [noise]\nYou have a question yes my question is I'm obviously should I keep doing oh okay [laughter] no you cannot use student loans to pay credit cards\nOkay do you have any advice on my income about sixteen twenty thousand dollars a year with my major Sam I'm sure it's kind of a manageable right now\nMhm okay well you're first goal is of course to eat and keep the lights on your second goal was finished school when we finished school\n[noise] um I Will be finishing next summer so buddy out in about a year okay less than a year good\nWell then an ad no more new debt that's a victory\nOkay then the second thing would be to pay the actual payments on their credit card just minimum and we'll call that a victory uh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on those you don't you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nRight like like the kind of I mean you know my black church to pay off credit card you know how\nTo understand and it's a really really dumb idea of how you're making a mess and so have you cut up these credit cards\nUm I Know you haven't caught them all up [laughter] yeah I don't even found my French too\nI don't care if you use them or not drop 'em up I'll\nStop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you that you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWell it can't work more because of high school agile and out of the fact is that probably make about an area where I'm located\nOkay well I a little more money on another thousand dollars a month to change your life uh-huh\nSo that's what I'm looking at is what what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income can change hopefully with a new um\nWith a new job and a new career at that point um but hang on until then and stop borrowing on student loans to pay off credit cards Naomi is in Seattle hang Naomi how are you\nBetter than I deserve thank you sure how can I help um so my husband rented a small business from home and and it hasn't been bringing in as much as it used to live for the past like declining steadily and that so I'm Wondering do we still are hard to quit to get another job\nYes and what's wrong with our business was dying\nA I'm not sure it did when we used to make a combined ... two thousand a month and now both of us with the business gets down to five thousand dollar\nHome mortgages large chunk of what we are now\nOkay I'm a little bit confused because you modeled everything together so how much of the Fifteen thousand was you\nUm about three and ...\nAre you still doing that yeah okay so he was making twelve and now he is making seven yeah no no no no no no\nNo I was making nothing his business has almost disappeared yes you do know what's wrong with it what's wrong with it\nUm I don't know what I have to talk to and I feel like it's just a competition and that he he feels like the market it's a lot of online staff of the market flooded with what you think they were um\nSo what what does he do he sells clothes on line okay\nAnd in the last year will want so many people enter the clothing online business that weren't there before and I'm not going to grow up Ninety percent of his income\nThat's yeah that's it appears to ... to it like and there\nAnd you get a job or needs to fix this business yeah selling their homes and option can no because there's an fix the problem the homes not the problem the problem is is businesses failing okay\nAnd we have to feed their fix that we have to identify the problems with his business and make the changes to fix the business or we have to\nGet a job and close the business wanted to I don't care if we start selling something other than close the obviously knew how to sell something on the Internet at one point he was doing very well so I get a hundred and he's making a hundred and fifty a year\nYeah\nSo I mean he knows how to do something with marketing on the Internet some kind of digital marketing and uh it may be that the product line he's into the space she's in yacht invaded or maybe he's gotten lazy with\nHis ... and he's not handling is is digital marketing properly or I don't know I Can't tell what's going on but I can tell you this just sit in the head and the right way is it\nYeah it's not so I'm going to give them my friend Henry Cloud wrote a book called necessary endings\nGay and in that chapter in one chapter in that book he says that when you end something a relationship a job business whatever it is when you in something it's when it's bad and you have lost hope you have no reasonable logical reason to think it's going to get better\nAnd that's when you end it right I mean really if you if you're ... where the guy who's been drinking for Twenty years and he says he's gonna quit there is no logical reason to believe him a unless there's evidence to indicate he actually has quitting this time\nAnd you you know you're married to a drunk you got to make a decision at that point right in your case with this thing this thing's trending the wrong way you have to give me a logical if I knew\nYou and him and I look at this and say look at yourself in the mirror and say is there a logical reasonable good reason says that that we can turn this thing around if we turn these three knobs and get this business working\n[noise] if not\nThen we have to change the business for something different\nWe're going to get a job because

you to return your firearm and cut it into a new purchase and all the special offers for military law enforcement remember they wrap a lot of fire on the last Saturday of every month ...\nPh one on one of the H America's most trusted voice on money a business it's that Dave Ramsey show right now on one for one change you do you\n\nFor being with us America this is the Dave Ramsey show so glad you're here [noise] you know it's interesting [noise] um and informative to all\nOut of your trap and then you run to the light\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd and what's the difference in those two events it both light both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe that if you run to the lot you're going to get out of you believe you run to the law you're going to get killed right I mean so that's hoping hopelessness and all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our\nLives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us\nTo do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there are possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stuck but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of that in my ... and ... thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing a swamp thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about ... and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset walk\nThe world is coming to an\nEnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort\nHer [laughter]\nNow why are we used to and they in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless well\nWe've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been and have experiences that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call\n[laughter]\nThat's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective\nAnd so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it's it's gonna grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different then when you look out ten seconds\nThe young man I was just talking to and folks that have dealt with an homeless situations is one of the problem is the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that he wasn't getting it like go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go\nSomething somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because you knew that money come from work is where it comes from I Can't get an of ours will than work someplace else\nWork more work all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean when we were going broke I too little babies in life the houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it or to your mind off and well you know you you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know ... and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter\nOnly thing is just perspective it's like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich and\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out 'cause it it always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful and but because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot\nBecause I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these tracks in these rockets\nWith this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it it's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same name a different issue is your perspective\nAnd some challenges I might be right now that I think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months in say\nOne of I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's the question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it and I\nDon't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure\nHe heard me but if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with everything I have been through and I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long will take but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see\nWhat I'm Talking about here is that is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action\nIt's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you got to take to become unstuck wherever it is yeah\nI think that guy's got to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza\nIt's going to be All right yeah it can be\nYou can choose for it to be All right\n... and it's not magic and it's not positive thinking and it's not easy\nAnd it's one of the reason I re biographies of successful people\nIs it lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd it and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it [noise]\nThat that's what I'm you know that's where you are it's where I have been and am sometimes\nIt's going to be okay\nIt's going to turn out okay [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team

faced\nRacism in a way that a younger generation\nHas not face no matter how much they want to scream and yell about all the micro aggressions that stuff if we're honest with ourselves a grandpa great grandfather great great grandpa face racism to kind of racism\nWhich is thank goodness\nSlowly but surely it's never going to be gone but it sure the hell water isn't what it once was and they asked him and this is a guy who was an outspoken civil rights leader at a time and he had his issues as well\nUh Jim Brown the great football player but first of all I kept calling ... ... a ... a a ... but he uh\nHe said like I don't think anybody should Neal we're a family and we need to figure things out 'cause they talked about yes a\nPolicing all kinds of thing it was all over the place and at times it was surreal Kanye was holding court and it was interesting but he says and and\nPeople always say why is the right obsessed with Kanye and they're so happy for them and I said it's not the fact that he likes the president doesn't like the president because I don't think he agrees everything with the president I really don't but the fact\nIs is he's got a platform\nEgos match each other right they're both married to a powerful women and in and they may they get each other right like they get each other but\nIt's the fact that he doesn't go in step into with the left\nThat he's willing to go for I really don't care I'm doing my own thing\nRight I'm doing my own thing but something ... and and and I said this to to a couple of ... to me it's like why are you guys are obsessed and I said ... it's because you cheered him when he said George Bush hates black people write you cheered him but now when he's not on that same kind of path you're pissed off and angry\nRight he then he was a genius now he's insane so that's what you're going to do but he said something that and I said even if he's in St guys just want to understand this\nJust because he may have some screws loose and he was kind of all over the place today doesn't mean that some of the stuff he's not saying doesn't have valid points\nWhere I Am a Saturday Night live to improve on the liberals or improve on it if he don't\nWe don't look good\nTrump told the truth is these right on the line and that is true some I've been saying something I've been saying over and over and over and over and over again don't want to see the other side's fail\nIt's ridiculous\nIt is absolutely ridiculous to want to see the other side fall apart\n\nBecause that's the way you feel you can get power is ridiculous the hope that the president fails to Bill Maher saying I Hope we have a recession the people cheering fourteen hundred points coming off the Dow in two days because they're hoping this happens is insane that's that is for that is not patriotic is at all\nThe ... not\nIt is it's a sad sad thing but he was all over the place he was a the hat thing was just just crazy they talked about all kinds of stuff uh you know and and ... to me it was it was again it was surreal moment in the White House\nWell we make everything that China and not an America that were cheating on our country and we're putting people in positions that have to do a legal thing in the energy factory on the president's\nYeah but I mean it's\nDifferent I mean he he said a lot of stuff that I think it was a bit out there like that's one of one of the reasons that people make stuff cheap everywhere and Trump even fact checked him on Foxconn and a few other things but some of the reasons that people do the things that they do like go elsewhere is because we hear demand cheap goods\nBut I understand what he was trying to do and I think he said some stuff today that was real and and just because you don't like him because he's not on your team anymore as far as what goes because he's wearing a make America great again hats just because of that doesn't mean that all the things that he thinks should be discounted because a lot of times\nIt's true right\nBut he had to go off on some blackie tangents he did he did he absolutely did he went off of some crazy stuff when you're just like he said he's bipolar but not bipolar is a genius to test the Ninety eight percent dial it was all over the place to be shown Trump stuff on phones because apparently wants to design cars\nI don't know it is what it is but it was a surreal moment in the White House today three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us\nWith your black and you're a baby sitter what do you

were from Saudi Arabia there's some issues here absolutely but\nFrom looking at it in a different way of saying well you know what it sounds horrible we need to figure this entire thing out we've got to start figuring this thing out in saying that a hundred and ten million dollars that's that's a lot of money could be coming to the United states and they're going to spend it and there may spend it with somebody else a note\nWhen they get the money China or Russia and what are they going to do it\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three actually had been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you\nSo a very interesting the the whole question of the day is one of third parties you know when I saw what did I you know you've got Kanye in there and he's doing his Kanye stuff 'cause that's what ... does and it was interesting was holding court\nUh but my question is you know why can't we talked to one of the civility is gone and we're going to dig deeper into a little bit later but we need a solid\n\nThird party and here's the thing that's something I talked about before when it comes to stories we don't need a third party that's equal you can make a lot of noise\nBeing strong and small meaning if you took twenty seats\nThirty seats in the house maybe five or six seats in the Senate right you take anywhere between you know you've got intend to Fifteen Percent\nYou can do a lot of things you can't\nYou can do a lot of things and I think we need a real party and I'm Talking about the Green Party right what you'll Stein I'm not talking about Gary Johnson because God\nThat he just it was awful can we just admitted right like can we right I'm not talking about ... insane although everyday film last and he's like he's not she just wants to talk about it going that's why he's running for president block jade\nAnd said I'm Talking about what I'm Talking about somebody in a party that is real but I think could it you know the all sides and is there more for the most of the times I think the referee\nAnd the rain them in the mature party will call [laughter]\n[noise] what do you think though would you be open they could you be open to a third party\nThat's not insane that's not crazy but a real party fifty percent use the force that yes I can four percent say no forty six percent says depend on the politics and I think the politics would be very much an independent minded look at things and so let's just say let's let's break this down how this would work\nSo you've got a party that is somewhat in power right the has the most you can get a plurality just you're\nRight but you've got a party that's got then you've got another party there so the Republicans Democrats one of those who's going to have the most seats the second seats is going to be the other one this is the third is the one that's going to be swayed because you know those two can't stand each other and the right now it's worse than ever before so it ends up happening is they're going to have to come to you to get stuff done\nAnd if you're able to say look I understand what you're doing there and I agree with this this and this but you know what if you want to vote you got to get rid of this you gotta get rid of this you got to get rid of this because I see it from their side too so it is a way to move things through and that might be the best way to break the gridlock\n\nIn many ways just like being an independent who do both sides cater to come election time who was the vote they need\nThe independence because they're the ones that are going to sweat 'cause we're so driven and separated right now they got to come and they gotta go okay okay okay okay we need your vote what do we have to do\nI think in a bigger way if we can do something like this I think it would change a lot three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned show is your Twitter babysitting while black\nBabysitting right roughly I got I got to give an American women or maybe the lady across the street with the hands of somewhere warmer ready over here you following me because I've got [noise]\nThat was like me\nSo that guy right there cordless his name and he is babysitting and he doesn't mentoring program and and you know he looks to be in his mid twenties early thirties kind of thing and he's got like a eight and ten year old boy and girl in the back and they happen to be white and he happens to be black and there's a woman who was worried that these two kids have been\nTaken away\nSnatched from their parents because stranger danger is everywhere\nThis lady said it upon herself to say that she's going to say my place now I call the police raises the twenty eighth and this is what I got to do it\nI Can't go out with two kids that look like me and without something weird to see the way it is moving she's harassing me because I have two kids that do not look like [noise]\nYeah\nSo she's following them and it's a very weird situation okay first of all it takes them the subway and then he takes it to Wal Mart if you're going to kidnap somebody right like let's just say I've seen enough kidnapping shows to know that\n\nYou're probably not going to take them outdoors right like they usually put them in a room where you can't scream and they've got the room sound proved those kind of thing like if you're going to do that\nThat you're not like hey before we get to this part where I totally kidnap you and take you and how'd you forever why don't we go get a sub sandwich we'll talk about what you kidnappings they'd be like people go to Wal Mart we can get you some stuff to kind of just chill time you know you're probably not going to do that now we live in a world of see something say something I get that but here's my thing\nWith this if it's a white guy with two black or Asian kids are Hispanic kids they're probably thinking oh he adopted them or that's a good thing that they're doing their\nYeah now\nI also think that gender has something to do with it because I think if it was a black\nWoman with two white kids I don't think anybody would have cared as much so I think there's a little you know like it's a gender thing but this was ridiculous eventually the lady called the ...\nSee the police have to say about this early she ... she's\nAs a Walmart yeah maybe I got to give them babies and we ate is a ... or Walmart when got some guys hold up talking about some\nHollywood is okay turn left when I came back after this little girl so she can I ask her see the snow who I Am and then I went over to get some gas and Murphy or she came back their\nVoices and they're going for a year ago yeah\nAnd and eventually the police do you guys OK and they're like yeah you know and they\nCalled the parents or the mom of of the kids and the mom thought it was a joke she was like what this is a joke right and they're like no this is for real\nIt it'll be made into something big uh I I\nI said take a step back again we live in the world of see something say something and if it was a white guy with the black kids probably not having the same issue\nI don't know maybe but you know if it's a white guy with two Asians you know to a little Asian kids probably like I say Hispanic is probably thinking and I also say if it was a black woman with two white kids probably wouldn't have said anything it might be just you know what might be a gender thing\nMore than anything else think about that three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter tweet at us damn
