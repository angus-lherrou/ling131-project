I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time it let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going all the time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open and if he if he's being if the cancers come back at any stage right keep you keep putting open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay that makes sense to me it wouldn't\nIt wouldn't be insured oh\nYeah you know but I'm not you but but\nYou're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kinda money you could throw money into a investments and start having some money yeah\nAnd um but but at this stage I I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy so I'll be saying in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with cash now that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm\nGoing to hold it two years like the cash value pay yet at the end of that time if he's healthy or instill cancer free\nMakes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm\nGoing to hold it two years but at the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy or instill cancer free I'm dropping it otherwise I'm going to keep it if ... if he's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem\nFolks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole life life insurance universal lot verbal life is rip off\nYou just experienced it you ... back in and\nWhat happens if you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens because the money they put in that that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if I had to put it into that and a good investment instead of getting ripped off by this insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K.

your household income\nUh just under two hundred thousand a year phenomenal and how much is college on our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them okay good good health for all\nOf that so my question as they currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars and our retirement account [laughter] my husband's company doesn't match that we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm my company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest five percent may give me ten mhm\n[noise] so that's the fifteenth so my question is do I find a different way to invest that other Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make mine a Fifteen or do we put that extra about three hundred and eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIs four thousand dollars a year\nDoing much better\nWhen you do for sure\nWell I mean you know your act like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nAnd it would make a much better day in my retirement account or a you know\nSo I I Want you to put at baby steps for Fifteen Percent of your household income you put Fifteen Percent of your household into I'm into retirement it doesn't sound to me like you're doing that

you get a little bit of a bonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze some money out of your budget but ... there's three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off 'cause you buys you guys have been concentrating and focusing in probably what's going to happen is when the kids would get the kids off to roll you probably just go vision of the house in that year\nA cause that forty you'll be down to about forty by then and then that year you'll just knock it out so um you're fine you're doing really good obviously\nReally really good overall but um\nUm they're fine you're doing really good obviously\nReally really good overall but I'm going to do ten percent you put\nFifteen Percent but

attach themselves to a cause they will run through a brick wall and so the sharp millennials are the sharpest I've seen and I don't know when the dog millennials are the dumbest humans I've seen and I don't know when the most shiftless participation trophy living in your mother's basement group I've ever seen\nAnd the good news about millennials is they're really only two kinds fabulous and socks\nAnd there is a bunch of 'em that are fabulous\nAnd so I don't know why I decided to take up the cause of bragging on millennials I think it's because there's a group of people my age and in the media and in some of the stupid but magazines and stuff that say all kinds of negative things about them is if the entire generation is living in their mother's basement collecting participation trophy so it's just not true\nThere's a group of them that are but there is a group of them that are freaking rock stars too and so you know I I guess that's why and so I've just kind of ... and when I pick up one of these articles now I don't know why I get mad about it I don't like it\nAnd CNN Money is a become a ridiculous publication it's just a ridiculous publication the reason it's ridiculous publication is they will print anything\nI don't know if they have an editor or not that actually looks over this stuff and goes this bull crap we're not putting this on our publication\nBecause they will print anything one article will make a lot of sense and be very good and the next article you would think the guy's parents are cousins that wrote it I mean dumb human beings writing articles in published in CNN Money\nAs I've seen everything and CNN Money so I you know occasionally I'll quote something out of their positive but this one just burned me up\nMillennials aren't opening credit cards and that's a mistake\nFrom CNN Money\nDon't use credit cards like their parents or ... or their grandparents less than a third of millennials say they have

broke\nThat's a normal scenario at a decent retirement going into this scenario [noise]\nLittle bit of a nest egg there but it's all gone in nursing homes are not evil they're just have to be paid to operate the people that work there actually want to feed their kids so they need money called payroll\nSo they're not evil and they're not ripping people off at home mom wanted to go to a nursing home it's like saying I Want my money to go to a restaurant even though I eat there\nWell that's dumb don't eat there then okay so but if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and long term care insurance is absolutely a vital part of financial planning but not until you're sixty when you have kids or not\n[noise] J. D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nA Dave I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we've got baby at three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through at the you know we coordinated it\nThank you and yeah and my ...\nWhen the ten percent but I hear you on your show the twenty percent even prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there then been one of those too so I'm just wondering what what makes the difference between ten and twenty or is that\nOkay a good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage\nOkay not one All right uh uh the in when somebody's buying a second home I pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down twenty percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first one\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down and you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with a standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. A. J. loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. fans for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on you and lose money on the foreclosure\nAs well as for it so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay at ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you write a took a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage he got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone if you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the ... when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of\nAnd then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nFact that we're in fact in California where home prices\nAnd then they will drop the PM I later\nAfter you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared with conservative and\nNow it doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just because you're in California they don't like okay you ...\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the home prices markets you were in the more difficult this discussion because I wanted to get all the way down to ... percent\nI'm not requiring twenty percent but you get ... you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have this thing to me I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you right\nSo that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent then keep counting on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset within appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PMS drop so you're not doing pm after Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can 'cause then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on the first time homebuyer you're doing baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't want to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well those of us that\nAre in tune with being smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up [noise] okay so I'm twenty five ah I've I've done pretty well for myself\nUh I have a dilemma though my ... he'll as cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred bucks to ask thirty eight model what the big game in it and it's a hot yes I paid\nWell below Kelley Blue book value and I have about five to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and I've been listening to you and going through your baby steps\nIf he won't be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and use the money to finish my murders based on\nWhat is your and what is your car worth\nA private market is twenty three who I think\nAnd and you said you're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars best ... uh I have no credit card debt\nMhm no I don't know what are you single I'm Single and what's your income\nBy a gum is about forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime\nIs this your only dead on the car that's my only debt and how much do you want to\nUh oh sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one steps\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year or maybe you have no life but you get to keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that day by the ... yeah I get I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand a year making fifty grand if you're single ...\nEnormous yeah I get I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand a year making fifty grand if you're single ...\nYes sir I keep the car\nOkay let me tell you how to let me tell you how do they tell us it's just not how much you love the car or a little card is although both are valid\nBecause it as a seriously cool car but the analysis is this can be debt free except your house and under two years the answer's yes [laughter]\nAnd all your vehicle the total of all your vehicles worth less less than half of your annual income and the answer is fairly yes and you really love the\nShow you're willing to fight for keeping somehow more than half of your annual incomes hot up especially goes down in value from one car guy to another caller guy okay I got lots of cars so they are less than one percent them I'm at work\nSo just give your son I have toys go get some money first and then you can have toys and this is that I ...

odds are long they are winning are still slim around one in three hundred million for each you're more likely didn't give birth to identical ... or the come things didn't win the jackpot sold\nHer big commerce saints while giving birth to ... or whatever being struck by lightning while riding around on a great white sharks back bats the odds of that but the reality is is everybody's got a chance that's the beauty of\nYou may have bought a hundred tickets or you may have bought one ticket but you've got to take a shot don't ya\nMore likely to get hit by lightning when and so you don't play that one either\nYeah now here's some issues okay now one of the things a lot of you out there played office pools do you understand how it works\nBecause\nMoney gets involved people get greedy and weird and then it goes south so take a deep breath and look around and\nSay rise everybody in are they out we want to know for sure and there's a reason for that\nOffice pools don't always go as planned to take a construction worker and New Jersey who was in charge of buying the lottery tickets for his work pool but without telling anyone he claims the thirty eight million dollar when for himself alone\nHe was sued and lost which is why experts say set the ground rules early and then right\nYeah one hundred percent early and in writing because the lawsuits are going to have 'cause what ends up happening is people totally get involved and they said well\nWait a minute here I was here every day for a year and I gave you money and at times I was the one who got the tickets and I happened to be out because it's my daughter's anniversary graduation slash whatever glistening of grandbaby and then all of a sudden you guys don't account me into this knowing full well put money into lawsuits come and it's a nightmare\nHere's the other thing people change and I'm not talking about a lottery winners there's going to be some change there\nBut the fact is everybody around you in some way shape or form is going to change because you're no longer the person that was the next door neighbor you're now a bank account you're no longer the person\nWho just lived a normal life like everybody else you're now worth hundreds of millions of dollars and everybody who's got a wacky idea a crazy idea or who's been there with you feel that you should invest and or do you owe them something so a lot of times what happens\nIs people actually change far more than the winners do and it happens in everything look at sports look at people who become famous ... when it comes in the entertainment world they'll tell you\nThat it's a lot of times the people around you that change and then they're mad because you don't give in to whatever it is that they want\nTo be strong you gotta know there are some people that you're going to help\nAnd the other people out there that you're not gonna help because you know they're only here because we're third cousins twice removed and they haven't you haven't talked to him for Fifteen Years but they're calling 'cause I got a great investment opportunity and they just happened\nOh you won the lottery I didn't know that yeah yeah yeah hit the road punk three two three five three\nFour twenty three at you I bet that shows your Twitter you can tweet at us every single day\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three at you I bet that shows your Twitter you can tweet at us every single day at this time we'd like to give you a little something something something something we call this our urban word of the day\nIt's half of the urban word of the day I Am right now time to get a little more hit on the street I Can't understand a word you're saying before\nToday\nAfter you win the lottery or I win the lottery I'll be putting on my serving look what does that that somebody who was on point everything about them is on point I'm going out and I'm going to serve the world the best of me oh yeah\nI Am dial to the nines in my outfit my hair looks did like never did before I look everything that is supposed to be everything on point\nIt is my serving looks and I'm serving to the world my looks with eight hundred million dollars serving looks your urban word of the day\nThank you for the net and dated urban going about our understanding is that there was an urban word of the day we damn stress shore cranium\nFor some way and then a more to buy some schools in a recreational sort of for the children [noise] operates them after school programs to things they need for learning\nEverybody's going to have an awesome I mean everybody like something that you're going to do that nice thing that you do for somebody or something I think it's great I Do and I remember I if you've ever known anybody who has a lot of money a lot of times what ends up with money is that person usually if they weren't jerk there were a jerk if they were poor\nAnd if they're good people it just allows him to be better people\nRight that's that's the reality of a lot of what happens to people are some does it change a few people yes but by and large it just allows you to be more of who you are\nMuch I've known people with tons of money I've known people with money like you couldn't believe with the B word that's right and I knew before too and they were kind of jerky\nAnd I knew him after and there was still kinda jerky\nSo it just allows you to be more of who you are three two three five three twenty\nFour twenty three actually had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you Mitch McConnell Nancy Pelosi they've got something in common and it's not a good thing and it has very little to do with them talk about that midterms as well and Halloween did it make a home away and if you had\nThe the way to the gym and such and\n\n\n\nSuch adventure and show [noise]\n\nDid you know you can vote with your dollars by switching to a patriot mobile patriot mobile is so much more than just a cell phone company they stand up against the crazy liberal agenda everyday by donating to conservative causes ... mobile provides nationwide reliable service with unlimited talking tax for less money and no hidden fees\nEverywhere you look there's something new and that's why I always say data and facts are amazing but it it's who's giving you the facts what numbers who's asking the questions how were they asking the questions that speak\nThe truth is that they had a big lead at one point in time but I'm not quite sure that there anymore\nHere's what our brand new and be seen as Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks ago until the mid term among registered voters Democrats only seven point lead in the generic ballot forty forty one down significantly from the ... point lead Democrats held just a month ago pre Kevin all what it was a teacher forty\nYeah and now you've got this caravan which I think it's going to be a big thing\nBut Trump's been going around and you can do it everywhere he goes pretend I'm On the ballot for attack because in many ways he is especially when it comes out I think the Senate they're going to pick up a few seats in the Senate there were too many\nDemocrats in red states that had to defend\nWhat looked like assume nominee in the house maybe more of a trickle so he said hey pretend I'm Out there and guess what right now for Trump\nFor President Trump he has his best numbers in in our poll among registered voters forty seven percent approve of his performance in office or forty nine percent disapproved that substantially better than his numbers last month in our poll forty four fifty to approve it per se but again among those likely voters his numbers didn't get worse forty five percent of ...\nAnd then his numbers last month in our poll forty four fifty to approve it per se but again among those likely voters his numbers they get worse forty five percent approve fifty percent disapproval\nBut it should be among voters that show up and that's going to be the big thing is it going to be massive that I don't know the fact is is\n[noise] I don't know who's showing up I don't know who's showing up because\nYou see all this stuff for like three weeks ago four weeks ago five which was a done deal it was the nominee coming\nI said yeah but they're probably hold on to the Senate but it could be massive tsunami then you had the cabinet debacle and both sides really jak the boots for the Senate I think as far as the Democrats\nAre they came out in the end when voters source voters in a way that it it made them look far worse and now you've got people that are getting excited now you've got this other thing this caravan coming here and ... maybe that all that excitement enthusiasm that once was there isn't the way it's just it's not the way it is anymore\nPublications is only six months ago I think we were all talking about a blue wave that we knew was coming and it was going to be very significant we're not quite talking that way anymore it looks kind of more interesting and complicated in this state by state\nYeah and it's and it and it's going to be much closer than people think\nI don't I don't know\nI I ... and the people I talk to you because I look a lot of snakes polls are some of them who is asking the polls the second thing is is is balance\nRight balance is huge how many ballots have gone out those kind of those things are big the look at it a lot of people are are and then you've got to start putting stuffed together she ... she got polls then you've got to push it up together and try to come out and at this point in time I think for all intents and purposes is the best guesstimate\nWhen it comes to it and I I couldn't tell you I could not tell you at this moment in time what I Do know is I ... of of all the things I can tell you I think\nFor the people I've talked to one that looked at the Senate\nLooks like they may pick up a couple seats the Republicans the house was once a big worry for the Republicans of it being an absolute just slaughter now they feel like they have a hunters chance of holding on to it but even if they lose it it's not going to be by\nA huge margin and in some ways that's a victory it is\nNow we live in a new world of politics and I'm going to say this coming up with something that ... that it's just very very sad I don't like it Eric Trump spoke about this the other day and and I think it's ... we've got to start standing up\nA Maxine Waters I'm looking right to you because I think I've had enough of this and most people I Know Seventy percent of us are in the middle\n\nWe don't really identify with either party we're we're in the middle there's Fifteen Percent on either side or or or depending on what you're looking at maybe eighty percent of us in the middle and and twenty percent of the size of ten percent I tried that is\nJust insane and\nWe need to start speaking up more I like civility in this world\n... America might have people on the right they might have people on the left what America doesn't like what I don't like\nHis radical right and and they have become a mob left has\nBecome a mob the vast majority of them you see people using them lighting pickup truck on fire him yelling at people in restaurants when they're going out to a nice dinner with their wives the one day a week with Ted Cruz you saw you know you saw what happened here they're making Ted Cruz was like a sympathetic harassing at the Supreme Court Doris while making funny I mean people are into the stuff I Know that wants civility\nAnd they're they're making Ted Cruz looks like a sympathetic harassing at the Supreme Court Doris while making funny I mean people are into the stuff I Know the the\nCivility yeah you know what they do they do and no matter what a lot of people say out there well let's see if you guys are just now it's ridiculous both sides are part of a case in point something that I Will point out both sides of the BS this is Mitch McConnell the other night with his wife at a restaurant hanging out [laughter]\n\nYeah\nSo they they threw left out of sort of the get out of the country get the hell out of their bang on the table took the goody bags that it was like a doggy bag and it's ridiculous Nancy Pelosi and an event in coral Gables\n[laughter] the\nHere because\nI had enough of that you know what both sides are ... those are the extreme is we don't need Maxine Waters I looked a writer you\nBecause you've told people to go out and get in each other's faces you've told people that I'm looking writer you this rhetoric this kind of attitude has if it doesn't do anything going up to Seventy something year old woman or man and getting in their faces if you got the ponies of steel to do something like that\nStep off have a debate I have a conversation so you know what Mitch\nI don't I don't like the way you handle things uh I'm just letting you know that and you walk on\nBy doing what you're doing is ... it really is it is absolute jest and it doesn't help anything there is no conversation here it's a joke\nIt is but this is what happens when we the mass keep our voices quite and allow the few the bully pulpit the microphones the bull horns to do whatever they want\nIt's okay to have this course it's okay to sit down and talk it's okay to protest it's great part of being but then there comes a point where this is a joke\nAnd this is one of those things polo seated deserve that Mitch McConnell doesn't deserve that this is a joke it really really is\nWhy don't you go after Republican leaders the way Republicans go after democratic leaders\nI don't think it's a of a message the realtors the\nVoters are listening for both political parties to say something other than a political squabble underway in Washington they're looking for us to address the issues that affect them and the future the costs to preserve prescription drugs whether they've saved up enough money for retirement making sure the health insurance is available and affordable\nThese are things that Dr a message on the Republicans can win on those issues so they get personal [noise] ah I've talked to a lot of\nReally look in the left us both sides to somebody just to extend the real culprit struck really I don't think Trump ... and you know Trump is a bully at times absolutely absolutely wrong he says things that drives me crazy a lot of people out there\nBut the Maxine Waters of the world screaming and yelling and say getting people's face go out do those kinds of things come up enough both sides\nNeed to stand up and look at somebody people say what would you have done that somebody would say that's below zero went over to the front of the guy I'm like look I may not agree with her politics but this is this is this is yes same thing with Mitch McConnell doesn't help at all three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... or Twitter\nThis is BS same thing with Mitch McConnell doesn't help at all three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at as a Mac\nAlright you ready to join a Mac huh\nYou're ready to join a organization that's going to go out there and fight for you it's going to go out and fight for things like small business owners tax reform things like immigration reform that's common sense go out there and fight to to stop\nThe push of government run health care that's what a Mac is it is a conservative alternative and are you ready for one year free joined today if you're over the age of fifty they're not even ask you for credit card all they want you\nTo do is sign up in his simple it is easy go to a M.
