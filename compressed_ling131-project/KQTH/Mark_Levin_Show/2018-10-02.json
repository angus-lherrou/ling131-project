I'm I'm paying money to fight them education they take up the car so I say about that like to buy year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that's you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh out on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need a double your income\nYou know pretty quick here as fast as your cattle and when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no dad do you have any debt at all\n[noise] um ... who had about at a time very ah down our twelve thousand dollars a day I'm which not on our country that too um that they're taking care of that he just got back in established more credit\nWhere do you mean they're taking care of that\nSo they they can take the money and they offered to\nPay a whole not allowing off yesterday\nWe don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any debt you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent that free\nAnd then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are like five thousand dollars a set aside\nFor emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nAnd you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay go ahead well you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know your Thirteen thousand and when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can this doubling that's still not a lot of money but that will at least get you out there and get your moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us from prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\n[laughter] well my wife and I we've got five ... five kids and we just moved into our dream on three years ago or ten twelve acres to walk through with the kids turn around but the last few mind for just started your plan and we're in baby steps you\nAnd we're just thinking um I mean we've got thirty five thousand I'm dead besides the house and we're just not sure if we want and we need to sell the house has to be free or which is ... through the next and Fifteen Years and just make it out than\nTen to Fifteen Years remain pale ale house and everything\nYeah like ... where you know we have twenty eight years left in the mortgage\nMhm so what's your house you can come it's about Seventy K take home pay take 'em All right yeah and um then what is your house payment\n[noise] it is around twelve hundred a month\nOkay house payments not out of line here that's fun you know but you gotta lotta you've got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah because\nYou got thirty thirty five an hour to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably gonna take ... year and a half two years but something like that you need you no longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up way what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of debt\nA part of the law and my parents and part of it is lamp credits twenty five line of credit and ten grand and loan from our parents\nOkay All right so just a line of credit what'd you bond with the line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago [noise] or just miscellaneous things\nOkay and that's over right\nYeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just want to be free yeah but we love the place\nWith my I don't think I don't think you need to sell the house houses now killing your twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home by not out of line\nYou're oh you're okay on her house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can every dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clearly there's thirty five because if you can clear the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids\nAnd you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou can do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand out of Seventy thousand with five kids it means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and the charm landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nHi Dave I'm great got how can I help [noise] so I was wondering about emerging thick until we have a fully funded emergency\nI knew that I of three to six months good and I have about\nFifteen thousand in there [laughter]\nUntil we have a fully funded emerging hundreds of of the three to six months of good and I have about\n... camp out and then there I'm at my job from a trip they count on they match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great um should should I fully fund the account and shit I count that\nTowards the Mueller emerge Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills it will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house for as a single income\nNo signal and okay and what's your household income of around and what do you do er nurse\nYou're a nurse okay very very stable career\nMeaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one and twenty minutes nursing\nIs just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back at all you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in the sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of a career that's not\nSo specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something like your six minutes um then given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at it you find that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to about three months\nOkay and so that's kind a like partially leaning on the ... say as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you again you could lose a job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different\nThings happen transmission blow out of the car and all kinds of things that can happen that aren't medical and you can't use the ages for anything but medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact you've got a big fat I just said with a big fat match on it which is just wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being on the free month side of the three to six months\nRange for your emergency [noise]\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and the build up your wealth\nWe were absolutely we were in in in in your guys as ministry hands down\nAlso very cool or we're glad we're part of it gives you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely incredible what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nI'd say there's a few things are obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how it was enough troubles in trials in life that if you guys I'm working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessing probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to wear your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and\nIt wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three jobs she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go in because I have a lot of time off with my job and I I didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off in and out of University in and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and\nIt's you know I I mean what did you make it that good for my average income is probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five um up how much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and you know I got the only lease it I think he would approve of\nThis is Dave Ramsey lease um when I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was gonna buy a beat her for a thousand bucks and my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you\nDoes the Dave Ramsey least um when I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was gonna buy a beat her for a thousand bucks and my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you a thousand dollars if you let me drive the Pontiac for the next year and it's an old beat up Pontiac and I'm driving two miles to work and um he said yeah I don't ... so\nI'm you know at least at least ... at least it from him for a year [laughter]\nSo ... what was the best paying part time job that\n[noise] um probably with what I Do now and I worked for a different school districts and within the area that we live and and I'm able to just that my schedule ... and ... being you know with my child ... majority in the time it's nice to have that at the time we can\nGet the flexibility and you got good payout of yeah good

on the street I Can't understand a word you're saying\nLike this one [noise] fitness route [noise] what's that spin truth simple when you get out there and spend a little truth you throw it out there

is saying\nIs absolute truth period case closed cannot be distributed because they're bitten truth I used to like say the facts but whatever you want to call you call it but bitten truth\nIs your urban word of the day Banksy procrastinating dated urban planning so that our understanding\nIs that there was an urban were other day we damn stress shore cranium\nWhat we didn't see when that apparently he stayed on stage during a commercial break a date approach from Iran causing some in the audience there\n[laughter] [noise]\nYeah he got booed old Tanya there where the magma hat and the whole nine yards and he's an interesting character because I always tell everybody remember he told everybody in the world standing next to the photo Michael my and Mike Myers about Michael Meyers that have been interesting uh that uh George Bush hates black people and then the Erie is doing the things that he does\nHe is interesting and apparently he's reached out to capture next to try to broker some sort of meeting with Donald Trump him in ... which I Would find interesting wouldn't it be interesting is that that that's something Donald Trump will do\nVery very interesting but I just love you know what I I just like a person that kind of does their own thing without the groupthink world especially in the Hollywood world that he lives in and I you know I Know some of it is probably just a piss off everybody but he's a very interesting character all ... three two three\nFive three Tony ... chose your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you will she or well she run plus somebody's on sprinted me because of something I posted today we'll talk about that as well or kids were just getting started to chat about the ...\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n... adventure and show [noise]\n\nOn September Seventeen Seventeen Ninety seven and the constitution was signed defining our government and guaranteeing our rights each September we celebrate constitution day and do the numbers could never have imagined a cell phone they didn't share your right to free speech and self determination which is exactly what patriot mobile is all about\nAnd in this there is no simple there is no hot that's why it happened\nWhich makes everything even worse three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter you can tweet at\nUs Brock Obama is out doing stuff not a shocker\nThe former president has now throwing his name behind two hundred and sixteen democratic candidates in federal and state races on the latest ... the ... democratic nominees for governor in states like Arizona Connecticut Florida and Michigan he's backing Christine hulk with the first openly transgender may already candidate for governor in Vermont\nAnd Tony Evers the superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin is facing off against Governor Scott Walker\nIn a release the former president says he's focused on close races in which his support would make a meaningful difference\nBy love David Garcia who supports in ... that you've never met Ninety nine percent of these people\nBut if he can get out there and like the the big raised with Martha ... Sally because Trump is kind of come out to Arizona next couple of weeks you got cinematic style you know they're going to try to do everything because this is one of those seats\nThat they believe they can flip this is one of those seats they have a shot at flipping can we flip this seat and it's really interesting when you see because the look the midterms for a lot of people I saw a\nBan and over the weekend he was on the bill Maher which was a very interesting thing because people are saying look let's treat this guy\nKinda cool 'cause we just be nice and he comes out and he says you know what I I like the fact\nThat you come on here because this is why the Democrats are losing because Republicans are willing to go into the lion's den and ban and said look I don't I don't\nCome on here because this is why the Democrats are losing because Republicans are willing to go into the lion's den and bad and said look I don't I don't do interviews with the Breitbart send the Fox is sort of stuff yeah yeah I Want to go in and actually let's go into the you know into the teeth line that's going to lie and said let's talk about stuff\nAnd I like that but he also said that this this right here will be a referendum on Trump and this is the first chance where you can look and see what may or may not happen and you've also got to deal with President\nA president's party almost always loses seats in the mid term elections there have been like two exceptions in the last eight years second apart his prospects are generally linked to the president's approval ratings currently Trump's average approval rating this past month\nIs about two points lower than Obama in two thousand ten when Democrats suffered a disastrous mid term\nInteresting very interesting and with this comes a potential here\nYou know with you know the whole thought process of hey could we started impeachment and that is something that I think smarter Democrats who are more politically astute who aren't just riding on emotion want no part of I mean you're not hearing that from the ... and the Schumer's and stuff\nBecause they understand what that does to a country they realize that but there are some serious issues here that the Republicans are going to have to deal with\nBut there are specific problems the strong for Republicans first\nSome for the Republican incumbents are leaving while only Eighteen Democrats have announced their retirement and it's just easier to flip an open seat second twenty five House Republicans are districts carried by Hillary Clinton two years ago\nMainly in suburban districts literally from coast to coast only Thirteen democratic seats are in Trump friendly district\nAnd it is here in suburban America where the president's approval ratings are particularly low yeah\nThat's understandable more rural America a and I I look I think I I I'm I Believe that\nThey will lose the house but they will hold on to the Senate and it'll be narrow I Do I Believe I Believe there's going to be an issue\nThat you know I think the Democrats feel like a it's all going this is going to be this is going to be a runaway thing we could feel the momentum building building but they just got so much to defend and that right there is is the issue comparatively to the house\nSenate is completely different the map for two thousand and Eighteen is nothing less than a nightmare for the Democrats only one Republican seat is an estate Clinton Terry that's Nevada but\nTen democratic incumbents are running in states that Trump carried five of them by landslides and in those states pumps approval ratings are better than the national average right now Democratic senators are facing serious challenges in Florida Indiana Missouri North Dakota Montana\nYeah so I I I think the worry that the Senate is going to be lost I wouldn't be surprised when they picked up a tutor to that changes a lot of things are a member a lot of ... we're looking at the Senate here and the Senate is\nWell Kavanaugh it's SCOTUS\nI think a lot of people worried that they were going to lose potentially the Senate and the house and the impeachment may start but the reality of the whole thing is is that they're able to hold on to things that will be huge just in case they do end up blowing out cabinet gives them an opportunity to come back with somebody else Amy Coney Barrett or whoever they choose\nWhich would you know I give Trump again another opportunity if they're able to pick up some seats\nThen\nThat would give them some breathing room which I think they would love to have like any party would love to have you ever it's\nOpportunity if they're able to pick up some seats\nThen that would give them some breathing room which I think they would love to have like any party would love to have\nYou ever it's in the red states where the Kavanaugh nomination may play out particularly a influential ally remember only senators not congressman not house members vote on confirmation the feeling was that these red state Democrats might be pushed to vote for confirming having all the recent allegations\nOf may make that differently also in these states centrist Democrats are going to be pushed by their Republican opponents on immigration on whether they embrace the policies of the more progressive left wing of the national Democratic Party yeah\nAnd why is that important well because once this is over people start\nThrowing their hats in the ring and over the weekend Elizabeth Warren time [laughter]\n\nFor women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that and a woman at the top [laughter]\n\nAfter November that I Will take a hard look at running for president\n[laughter]\nShe's going to wait until after November sixth because she realizes if\nThey don't get what they think they're going to get this blue sue nominee that maybe just maybe people are ready for the the Hoover progressive side of things I still think that she's going through a rat in the ring I still think that\nBut I also think she realizes do if if if if they are served meaning ... by that I mean you know like hey you got served the the Republicans and they're able to hold potentially some some more of the house and they thought they were and definitely maybe pick up a seat or two in the Senate then the reality is is\nShe got to think or is this what people want right 'cause it's okay to whomever aggressive in New York in LA and Chicago and San Francisco in Seattle but it doesn't work elsewhere\nRight in Massachusetts it's okay to be super progress but is middle America ready for that\nAnd this populism and and bending over the weekend said it and look the populace some of the the socialist movement if you will they let me take care of you movement let me do all of these things movement is growing and I wouldn't be surprised if we had the populist moving to Trump versus the populist movement of somebody like a Bernie Sanders\nOr Elizabeth Warren and those will be our choices in a couple of years\nVery interesting three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet at somebody an friended me 'cause I did a video earlier\nUh doing lots of videos you ... your TV and and all over you know on the YouTube's into\nEverywhere are about the sick and tired of the White House and the guy in front of me and 'cause I was of course was guilty white guy just makes me laugh like super guilty white guy\nI'm guilty white guy and I'm just like really see that that is the
