AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone number that is how it gets started take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[laughter] how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't a school we owe a hundred K. on her house we're free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby in the next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and worked full time through school would be a little bit longer it about a five year program and totality a which is a prerequisite and and I could not work for the three years\nAnd the debt of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journey is make sure the one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answered this because there's the managers and disadvantages to [noise] um\nI don't think that would take away a yarn anymore right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nSo the question becomes a can you take that next step uh what are you calling\nOkay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step uh what do you call it the ...\nIs that right yeah nurse practitioner\nOkay oh okay ... okay and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that tree or program enjoy fame prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you can cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine\nYeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the in the situation you're going to casual that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to casual your way through that ultimate role\n\nReally know what are you making now [laughter] the\nOkay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically a year with that and how much does that skull caustic and he said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand yeah\nCorrect oh you could do it just for a bumper salary honestly and go and you that's forty can invest that but you're going to make forty came back in a year so yeah tens right if you do that I Know ... that and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do then that other school right now like the fact that you know the cash for it so now don't going to see them on that for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy the current events that's an increase in income at least and yeah and then move into the school and a few years and\nCast for that yeah that ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you\nPause you sitting here trying to run the numbers\nAnd I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven [noise] you can cash flow your way so I think it's both saying that's what I say because both of them are what you want to do both of them or something that you're good at\nArt folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the Daily Show don't go anywhere [noise]\n\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts from the feelings and that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna\nAnd they'll go through that and and trying to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches and places that will have\nPeople in the family that need this specific help that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a business you hide that financial coach but it's totally doable and to make that money for sure and valid I definitely would go through our training on that route\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plant or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach mean Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that that's one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to do these got the heart of a teacher well that's a ... right so I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there a but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight to five five two to five is the number can Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do\n[noise] I can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health teacher for Thirty years\nOn and I found in the last few years fat on me or something like the back of last year really then I'm drawn to\nIt's time for me to look for something else about the last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it\nUm yeah I can collect my a retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty on as opposed to going up all thirty five years of my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my husband that's a good idea because it would be a bit of a difference here I was\nAbout twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking about\nOn helping people find homes and property and\nOn I find that really interesting\nOkay not what I Love my teaching them but it's just time for it\nI guess I got good news I got good news for you and your husband okay\nSo for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role\nOf teacher before he retired without penalty\nFor five years\nOkay I just want to throw scenario what is over the next five years you built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of ... but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not\nMaybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nBob and it's a it's a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how those when people aren't working so that means it is night than it is weekends I thought what the busiest time and so\nTo say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband can decide that a year two years three years old can that even though to five years if you can\nWhatever it is and say okay we're in commitments amount of time and if you start to the herself that while I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents of the major 'cause most people do great when they have great people skills as it sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever you and your husband decide\nAh and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great real estate agent here and do you think about it is it so commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many how you sell super fun versus going from where we're at a salary as a teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year

mom and I were you [noise]\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve sir how can I help\nAll right so a little bit of back story I'm sixteen and I worked all summer to you know to try to buy a car but I've always wanted to be paying in a you know all cash\nAnd I wanted to ask if I should be slapped for having such a dumb idea that's been every penny or any of yard or I should have it for something else or uh put it may be in Iraq and I just want to know you know where we're where should go with this\nHow much money are we talking about\nUm about Fifteen or sixteen thousand\nGood for you very well do you think it's a very nice car for sixteen years old\nYeah um I've I've worked a lot you know I don't think should go on like a day mhm cheesier ended up I don't think I've got like a day and like three or four years about just thinking about it and how great it would be but\nFrom others do not share our view well hell bent\nCollateral damage what does that mean does it mean you lose your job your home everything you've worked for jak ton of Democrats can push their radical agenda on America\nI'm Wendy Rogers I approved this message and to urge you to merge street Republican or we can keep America great paid for by Wendy Rogers for Congress Wendy Rogers dot org\nAmerica's most trusted voice on money in business it's Dave Ramsey show why you\n[noise]\n\n\n\nActually is in Los Angeles I actually welcome Ramsey show\nAnd thanks for taking my call sure what's up in your or\nOr how um my husband and I don't agree he recently came back from a deployment and said he runs a divorce and a bankruptcy so um we are ...\nDollars on a diet and last year remain thirty five our debt breaks down to twenty five and car ten in student loan and Fifteen credit card and I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um so uh what what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back with family\nSo you're separated okay and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and I'm ...\nAnd they play because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed and Sharon not filed accepted she'd sons from the paper's closure she got to file too but um and we had to follow on all the different corporations analyses that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago [noise]\nUm so ah in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan in\nMind okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your student loan either way whose name of the credit cards in Baltimore\nEvenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on okay were he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name was the car in law who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on them and he has one of the air\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nUh Fifteen and can you know ... OK\nOkay the rule on a an asset that\nHas um that that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt\nAnd keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then\nYou cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt\nOkay you've found on me but that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt in the ... in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard so which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nFifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea [noise] I'd say about ten okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan that you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that and then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is\nThat if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\n[noise] or if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car that he's driving is it worth at least what's vote on it\nAnd say about that okay\nSo you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay Sam so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm In veterinary medicine and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working fulltime\nAre you a D. V. M no oh no I'm a ... year attack okay\nRight and so I'm In that's in the last\nNo oh no they're an attack your\nAttack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or are you going to be somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the car debt if he walks on all of it\nIs okay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be what does he make\n[laughter] ah last year he made about a twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nNo scale and he's here in the military [laughter]\nYeah no I have no security clearance you understand that he understands what I'm sure you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\n\nSo I mean his chances are moving up in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or bankruptcy but he doesn't make any money should be and and he just came home\nOf a deployment and he's lost his mind it sounds like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] I'm so sorry thank\nYou know he's just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is he\nGoing to heaven yeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got a force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to say oh you're ... to ... I'm In and get you you know get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here so I'm Sorry your face and all this one of ... listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay thank you thank you\nChris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGood Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWith a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guys Vander and uh [noise]\nYou know they had them kinda borderline whether or not to get a term life insurance [noise] a wife to kids at home and I'm the premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise] if I Do get approved so I guess my question is two parts [noise] and do I still go for it even if it's you know\nThree four hundred dollar a month premium um three or four months for how much coverage\nFor a ten times my my pay million\nFor a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nUh basically that made us\nAll kinds of you know how to get you okay are you are you overweight\nYeah okay that'll give me too [laughter] yeah\nOkay yeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the white down which also by the way up to the diabetes doctor already told you that you knew that right oh yeah I'm working on a\nGood for you so hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and my smaller policy\nUntil we can do those two things and like let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something here and um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care\nWe can get a better rate two years from now or something her and um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so you already knew these things right right um yeah [noise]\nUm [noise] but but I I mean what if you took half\nAnd at least you know she's are or how much you own your home [noise]\nOf two eighty what does she does she work outside the home now she works she works at home\nNow so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and put a couple of hundred in her pocket if something happened to you that's better than a half million is not the proper\nThat [noise]\n\nThey're struggling with money relationships career you name it you're stuck and you don't know what to do\nI mean I ... and I've talked to him people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMom we were so scared mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and put man I feel so much better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't wagging her finger at her and say no you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you ranger dia what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nWill you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control when they got it or that Debbie Downer right or party thing right the martyr thing you know and people do that all the time and as soon as they do that that's your opening jump in and go I think you can\nI really am because I felt the same way I didn't think I could do it but I think you really can I think you can have it when\nThey found that if they do at the you\nKnow no no you're you're already you already jumped on the front line you've got slammed down as you start saying that and that conversation she gonna shut you down you know they are all you got to do just talk about what if you did for you are or not for her to get\nAbout enabling like with your alcoholic fan obviously you wouldn't know allow for and drink without him to a bar knowing what I get married without giving money to drink\nYour rights and my parents they're basically eating out ... times a day\nFor ... and my dad that threat tired and they only have one income that are living on to it and kind of you know and and so when we met that they don't live in our in our state and so we go visit them and my dad he wants to take us out to the fancy dinner to show that he\nLoved that and we live here so much but I just want to scream absolutely not not that I don't want to train our relationship\nIt just said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go bad the only take us out to eat your two broke that stupid if you know what you're going to say that that's what you're thinking and I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that kind of stuff so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you back to talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel\nHey that cost up so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you back to you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors but you're just\nBack and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn ... loose you used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not in you know of course it only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and you know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went ... we've got killed each other I Know have bills to fight\nAbout money and um we'll fight about money anymore and have it in years\nUh and so how do you how do you fix that what do you do and you're just share your story talk about your story and they will start chasing you eventually to get that and go if if they ever reach out and say well look into that hey I can show you how you want me to tell you what we're doing\nBut don't ever turning go deep one step deeper and go because you're stupid\nBecause you're doing this wrong you go out to eat all the time he got stopped that don't turn into the instructor\nBecause the instructor or you're you're not in a position to be the instructor all you can do is lead them if you want to go to ... my my pay for it 'cause it changed my life not because you're so stupid you need it\nYou see the difference and you just keep directing it back through you through your story that your only shot and just talk about what it's done for you not what it'll do for them and then pay for it pay for it for them to go through and I'm\nLike mom someday when you're rich you can pay for the rest of the kids to go through or something if you want but right now under this is my guest just because of what it's done for me and you know it might not work for you but it was worked for me you know I just kind of keep playing it off and making them chase it a little bits of begging them to be smart\n[noise] hope that helps you open phones a AAA eight to five five to to buy your job and we'll talk about your life and your money this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents in a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to sand or insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two

with ... with our ... our political world across the board without making decisions nothing gets done\nAnd that's the frustration I think a lot of you have out there and this is one of those things where this thing is coming here\n\nRight these people are coming here this wave is coming here and while it is it is a it's a micro when the overall scheme of things when you look at the ... the visa program and the ports the reality is is they're arguing over this and well it's a well they're arguing it's just going to\nShow and they're just going to come here and then nothing will get done and all we'll figure it out as they'd like to argue even more than we thought\nThat's it period case closed and it gives both sides the opportunity to come out and say things you think\nPeople you got some bad people in those groups you got some tough people in those goods and I'll tell you what this country doesn't want them\nRight then come out and they can say that and they can also say that

around and go you know maybe we should think about marching on her own capitals and asking questions that\nAre being asked to ensure the hell are being answered by\nAny of our government any of our government\nSo that's a is the latest in the cover ups are and what a joke it it really is an absolute joke this whole cause shaggy thing is a joke and remember don't look at it from the snapshot of which is I'm Talking to people yesterday said why do we care about this guy I'm like it's not just this\nGuy right thinking about the bigger picture when it comes to Saudi Arabia their new leader all of this stuff this is just another thing to add to it\nOriginal concept was carried a poorly and the cover up was one of the worst in the history of cover ups versus a bad deal should have never been thought of somebody really messed up\nAnd then divorced cover ever and where should have stopped is at the deals than what when they thought about it because well the thought of that idea I think is in big trouble and they shouldn't be in big trouble\nTrump's like look I Know BS right like I I I'm a showman I Know how to work it exists didn't even pass my smell test this was awful\nNothing that they've done have as good as well and certainly has not been spoken of properly victims of all things even thinking about the idea they certainly that advantage of of execution and they certainly did a bad job of talking about it or covering it up if you'd like to say that but I Would say it was a total Casco\nAnd I'll say it because you guys all thought of it I think they did a good job in the execution not just that give us the story that was bad and now the crop without so then I got a new ones the crown prince spoke today and apparently look a show these kids was there and gave him as you so eloquently put a producer fill the sting guy\nI spoke with the crown prince yesterday and he strongly said that he had nothing to do with this this was a lower level\nYeah that's the new thing it's at a lower level it's ... and he's come out today it's awful it's horrible it's file it's disgusting it is we're going to find out who did this who did this General McChrystal\nGamble either an operation like this could be carried out by rogue elements without the crown prince of Saudi Arabia having knowledge of it or approval of it\nOperation like this could be carried out by rogue elements without the crown prince of Saudi Arabia having knowledge of it or ...\nI think maybe in some states could in Saudi Arabia I don't fly that credible it that's not how Saudi Arabia where now I mean the crown prince says an amazing at about a power and he has been pulling power in for the last couple of years so the reality is I just not I don't find that convincing\nThat yeah I don't either the guy knows everything that's going on there period case closed and distort he knows everything that is happening there\nEverything everything it's not somebody and and the fact that they Fifteen people flew in different times all of this stuff like I say the the act itself was heinous and disgusting the cover up is laughable\nAnd every day they have a new story and the fact that he came out today
