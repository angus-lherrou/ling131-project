I was living in the open like the ... people you know like being I'm like what the uh\nPutting that eight nine months and I paid it off I'm I'm kind of really proud of on but I Would be you should be awesome where to go\nYeah but I the next thing I might not ... I think he's gonna make you a little mountain [laughter]\nYeah so I live in a job and all that stuff I used to take the bus they do to be a long day then just to be very tiring for one of my low and I went ahead and go to a lady extend the gutter and into this kind of a live under the impression that it was okay to ... because they worked so hard that kind of a thing\nA good thing that can be five to eighty and the kind of look about thirty thousand others\nAnd one thing but the guy that I thought the cunning the show and ever since I've been doing better than me feeling relieved really bad about that because you know one of things you say that you should never get into that and that's exactly what they know\nHow can I help you today sure\nYeah so my question and I have a couple of questions one new thing I said ...\nWhat's your household income Seventy five to do it and\nYou make thirty are you oh thirty I'm sure you oh thirty oh yeah oh yeah were you how quick you're going to pay it off\nI mean if I put my mom like greeted with it and maybe I maybe two and a half\nMen and women are more like a year yeah you're single right yeah okay\nThank you for joining us on the Jean is with us in Los Angeles times Jean how are you\nAre you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nOkay um ... are just come back right after any shopping [laughter] so um I graduated high school a few years ago and I decided to go to community college mhm and with the community college um I work I went to a\nWork [laughter] um I did about like thirty hours a week off to go to community college and it wasn't an issue and now I transferred to a university I mean my first semester right now I'm In classes are just um you know a little bit harder\nSo my question was do you think I should quit my job and focus more on school for the last two years do you think\nI should just I'm just trying harder and a ... ... what are you studying accounting\nOkay I've got a finance degree and I worked forty to sixty hours a week while I went through school and for years at ... at the university level\nSo I'm a it's doable um you are you know you are doing a lot of studying and not a lot of partying for sure um the um how\nAre you paying for school um I go to I get grants and now for um ... the money for\nOkay so you're you're not going into debt no hello okay so if you quit work how would you pay for school\nI had a money saved up from a working for the past year I don't mind my bank ankle a hobby like call of mhm we left me a year year and a half\nNo I think I keep working okay if it ... last year if it costs you half a point when your grade point average um yeah I heard about it like cheap yeah yeah I graduated with a tuna and seven\nI missed it as a magnet by a missed making about three one ... still piss Thirty years later but [laughter]\nBut but you know what I have never had a single caller asked my GPA before they asked my advice [laughter]\nAnd I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they asked my GPA in my entire life ever in if you're willing to go to work for one of the top accounting firms in the entire world\nThey might ask your GPA and you might actually be in competition or GPA might actually matter on your very first job but after that it won't um and it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kind of stuff\nAnd so what are you doing for work right now\nUh I work at a bank mhm okay good\nOkay I poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one of them might actually be a four year degree\nYeah that's what I think into\nYou know wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if you can make a job change and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool\nOn top of it but I'm I'm\nYou know you're not working a hundred hours a week working thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this\nIt's very doable uh most people work when they're in school it's not that unusual really by the way when I when I Do and I was in I was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing\nThere how many of your work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand now maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but it appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us\nA ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nI Am doing well thank you for asking I'm Talking to you and my husband and I were I mean babysat to getting out of that and now we are and what you call they dream me on them for a down payment on or how much be finished reading the weird looking right now at about a\nGreat thing about them I frequent down um\nOur household income before\nI'm going to move back in the ... one twenty five I'm after bonuses cycle it's about one thirty two and so I'm trying to make sure that I really think about like how much how that by um that we are understanding the um\n[noise] I I I think you recommend and I forgive your take home pay exactly a okay perfect and so I wanted to make sure that like right now where I prayed with a million mortgage calculators and right now we're kind of had a funny one hundred I'm I'm One of\n'em and comes up like a reasonable comfortable amount of number yesterday and you\nKnow it was a big number it's a lot better numbers and you're paying now but if that's a ... a force of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows you have the math spread to prosper if you continue to budget\nAnd stay on track but again that's not what you should do that's the most you should do\nSo you can do less if you want to 'em or you could put it on a shorter term if you want to\nAnd you know I'm about less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with it on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all for anything ever\nIs a Fifteen year fixed rate\nWhere the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay look is one of those in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\n[laughter] Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] so\nUm my wife and I have been listening to you for many years actually it my dad got me listen to you and I was a young kid and um stupidly I did not take care bye And I have student loans and um we are considering taking a cash out refinance our house\nTo knock out the high interest you know um and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate\nAnd how much they want to do it and share my student loan debt that you know I'm right at forty eight thousand drunk and what's your household income\nFluctuates between takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring home closer to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in ... uh twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance cash to take care to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither\n... and so on now I I've never told anybody do that okay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years calm you're going to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life\nExcept your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be ready for that but you can't borrow your way out of debt and on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes ... radically irrelevant\nWe're going to go up so fast it's like you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years more like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful where Donald in\nTouch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can wear your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out of debt and work in your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron statement that we all make which I'm digging out a whole you're not digging out of hope you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper\nShe can't dig out of a hole to fill in the ... eyes get I'll climb out of a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a halt\nUnless you dig into China and work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation show you got to stop that you have to break that cycle but on the sand and say well not borrowing money\nEver ever ever ever ... [noise]\n\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this class you it's a big support group that I think everybody really needs to be a part of an\n'cause we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much that everybody had\nAnd were like wow like you know this is a big support group and you know this is a great way let's start with the baby steps ... and we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter bizarro intensity and it really helps how much are we had about ten thousand and so\nThat was hard for a nerd it was it was a right to check out and clean up as soon as the\n... takes your breath away so Veronica spender goes to clash you go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go I Am not sure I like this\nWell it wasn't so much that I didn't like it I just I felt like I Need it like I said strategies to help me because I I\nDidn't want to be in that either and I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as all the time and what was your\nBiggest takeaway then where you went uh-huh I see that now\nEverything about the awesome honestly and I think it was realizing our roles and and with him being than her that he is and then me just coming to my senses and saying you know is this\nIs this material things something that I really need to have men are using the ... system really helped me and now is how our budget and ... this is the amount of money we need\nTo pay for our groceries says you know this is how much we we can get in the church and this is how much we can give people for gifts and what not and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented those steps I you know we're just\nWith a little bit like Rachel, Rachel group is that a budget is permission to spend\nI Love your daughter permission to spend okay yeah yeah that's exactly what it is I\nNever sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money and that's the mindset I had to give myself was okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and we want it but in you know when I'm In control budget\nBut once I started I let it control me I don't know very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader window your brother was a cheerleader and you had the community that you've got plugged into which are leaders who else would your biggest cheerleader\nI mean we're really close to our family and my family they're all of them are very supportive of us we we both come from five brothers are\nFive kids from each family said she'd rather than to sit there and we have it come from a bank family ... and they were all supportive and I really and our friends and as well\nSo what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page ... you know communication is key and you know we went to the money and marriage last week and we were listen to a lot of the other couples mhm\nAnd none of them have gone through the financial peace but they've gone through a lot of seminars mhm and I think if they had gone through a seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page\nAnd it would just really explode once I get through that in ... and follow the ... the steps yeah\nAnd just you know riding down our goals is really important for us to do and once we had that you know we were very cool driven\nAnd especially being entail gems you got to be ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and said just staying focused and dedicated and discipline and really really helped us and and\nWell done you guys from very proud of you very well on your show a couple a lesson right joy that marriage money thing or it's but virtually stand up comedy 'cause they're both a book about a ... yeah they really are funny and they're both funny on the green room to by the way that I mean\nIt's the same thing so wow well well done well done we've got a copy about Chris ... book for you which are inspired want that to be the next chapter in your story that you're now millionaires in your well on your way\nAnd then of course a outrageously generous as you go along very very well done I'm proud of you All right\nRon embryonic I used in Texas Seventy\nBut all been Seventeen months making one to end the one thirty counted once you're a dead British grown three to one\nIs fun stuff man that's about as good as a gift throughout their life is good [noise] all I needed\nWas a strategy Allah needed was a strategy all on the Bush a strategy we got to get on the same page we got to get on the same page communication and the budget\nHere it over and over and over again don't ship shoal tonight to turn off the television with the kids to bed [noise] get off credit cards in the scissors and have a ... to me and you and your spouse shutdown

one of the homes on your street so far on average\nI had a very [laughter]\nOkay All right so you're right it's a barely at the top of the market right I'd write it down here\nAnd yours is yours is not like double the average house on the street but it's one of the nicest ones\nAt what\nTightly I it's worth two Seventy the average house on your street is stupid five is the information you gave me is that right yeah that that puts you at a little bit nicer than the average house is that right yeah okay that's all I'm Talking about ... if you're going to spend some more money on how much more money are you going to spend on the house\nPercent satisfaction guarantee that means even if you missed measure or you picked the wrong color of their own remake your blinds for free you get free samples\nShipping and with the new promos they run every month you'll save even more years the promo code Ramsey to get the best deal Hanna is in Georgia so my husband and I own baby step three be now what that means is\nThat they are debt free except their home life saved up their emergency fund a three to six months of expenses and three beam means beyond that they're saving for the down payment on our house we want to take her two young children to Disney World you're should\nIn cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot aren't you I mean you're stuck because you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy if I didn't either one not gonna be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month so that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I go to Disney yeah little kids\nYou part is perfect age for that um if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean\nRachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how ready time her husband had but they had a great time\nAnd I'm now ... but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that you have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals\nBut I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place and then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile and you start putting some pretty good college and five and six is when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense that what you're working towards the middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something and slows down our long term wealth building but\nThe purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it is good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave ... thank you for taking my call first time caller sure\nI'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training and buy a received like Marshall helicopters ticket\nUm however I unfortunately I Need a by eighty hours or more training I got discovered a the industry is highly regulated by insurance and in order to become a share of NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to\nFigure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot and get the hours\nYou know I I ... a a a a job or getting a job as a single pilot\nThat that moment you just said the wrong thing you said the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know like ... what's wrong well I\nOur fighter so that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that that kind of went off in bed and that's a that's why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as the ... the jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nA yellow I Believe it or not firefighters are definitely make ...\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter\nPilot yes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay\nUm and you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited\nValue yeah it's not that I think\nIt's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like a like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm I'm too far into it to I guess\nI'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except\nJust slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time because I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job done up to it and it was a child is not worth that much yeah it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo you're right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place\nI mean you've got connections in the fire department other lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours in the coal policy can get some cops and landings and get some of the council actually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently\nBuying a lot of them that we're at ... and both have prior craft gotcha not even turbine yet but um\nI mean I've even reached out to people on there on an aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those are ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy [laughter] so yeah I can get an hour here in our there but nothing really calm and\nTo know you're going to end up paying for these hours what is it the eighty hours cost\nWell considering some of the hour and a waste of a you know on the cheap you can get some of my two fifty a three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and all that kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely so ...\nYeah I went out and I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I I've got a ... I collect handguns and shoot them a lot\nUh and and also I burn through some ammo it's a but it's a ... I don't make any money doing who am I trying to make money doing it but it was just a hobby and so that costs money hobbies costs are on in this one is not going to cost you money it's actually gonna make you a little\nUp until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks under this thirty thousand bucks out of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return for your promise to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking\nFor a pilot that you know that much intensity uh sometimes or an employer will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area\nHope that helps interesting destruction [noise] interesting show [noise]\nThis yesterday Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and

me a long time to figure this out I was a smart enough to figure it out as early as they did well do I wasn't either I'm fifty six\nOh no one in three years it'll be fifty minds on your mind as well\nYou might as well be worry you might as well make the decision when are you going to make the decision here most powerful wealth building tool is your income when you spend the\nAverage car payment which is five hundred and six dollars over eighty four months right now according to national editors association when you spend the average car payment\nInstead of spending it on a ... but car pay cash for your guards isn't what rich people do\nPay cash for your cars is what's rich people do I put guys from our cars rich people no darling you will be rich people when you start paying cash for your cars maiming your drought junk for a little while and then drove a little better drugs in a little better drunk you move up but right now we're going to pay cash and instead of putting five hundred dollars towards\nThe prosperity Ford Motor credit and put it towards your prosperity\nAnd if you put five hundred and six dollars power for hours you put a mutual fund in your Roth IRAs got a good track record from age thirty age seven you'll have between five and six million dollars\nIn that account touchdown hope Iraq the car\nAnd our car regime and if you don't know if I were in our car payment that's what you're driving and when we look up stripping the dictionary well so your picture\nYeah that's right 'cause you're financing something is going down in value\nTo impress

okay to be used to but it's just not okay to stay there\nI've been there I just didn't want to set up camp you know you got to move on to do something different\nSo when you don't have any payments

because they're worried that your going to do something stupid I think that's more of Darwin's way of saying you know what let it be but self aside as your urban word of the day\nThank you for saying that in dated urban place so that our understanding that there was an urban word of the day we damn stretch your cranium one of those things that we hope to be able to determine his ... at the state of the vehicle was at the collisions and I think we have the technology to do that\nSo this whole thing with the limo I mean it was so insane this weekend so yesterday was sitting there and Jack's doing his homework and we're out in the lobby of the hotel relaxing and ah\n'cause there's going to be in the room while he does some work and it's OK cool to get a big t._v. out there and and all of a sudden we see some flashes twenty people dead and I thought wow so the first thing that came to my mind and this was an Eighteen wheeler must have hit a limo full of people right or a bus or something like that\nThen you found out they ran a stop sign or went through an intersection crashed\nThis whole thing is just insane and the first thing that popped in my mind is nobody's won a seat belt because you don't wear a seatbelt in these you get into a limo nobody puts on a seatbelt 'cause it's a party it's fine you in the back of these big limos you're hanging out you have a good time and\nIt's weird that that's not enforced it is weird like\n... ... people break in and do all kinds of stuff and think about that if I'm driving let's have a talk show or something like that right so I got I got a just an SUV\nYou can't sit in the back and party right you can't sit in the far back where there's no seats and just drink and do stuff but in limos it's just kind of like do you think and to me I find it to be where they've been with buses how ... school buses regular how hard is it to put in a seatbelt\nRight for everybody safety and I'm not worried about there's always been my thing in situations like that where there's been on on trains and stuff like that\nYou take a lot of traits there's no see bills and trying to their nope no seatbelt on trains yeah sake is filled weird like that the staples on airplanes trait but here's my thing it's like I have never been worried about okay so if I'm seatbelts and I'm always worried about the person that's not\nThat's going to come flying into me at Seventy miles an hour\nBut it is odd right and you got twenty people dead twenty people that think about that for a second we'll probably that's probably the biggest accident of the year as far as mass casualties and the NTSB their airplane and then twenty people that's how insane that is\nEighteen and the limo to outside of the limo crazy\nTwo three five three twenty four twenty three ... method shows your Twitter because we had a lot of stuff still to get to today people are already jockeying for position for two thousand twenty and well John mayor doesn't want you to be an alpha male what yeah what do you hear the jets\n...
