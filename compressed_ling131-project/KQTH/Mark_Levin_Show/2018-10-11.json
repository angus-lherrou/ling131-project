or you're taking place in your house and the south shore [noise] I'm Dave Ramsey your host of this is your show on the phone number here's AAA eight to five five two to five [noise] now for many years ago I discovered\nThat there are thirty one proper ...\nYou read the book of wisdom and the Bible written by Solomon there's thirty one of them which makes it fairly easy to read one a day\nSo if you don't do anything else in your spiritual walk or in your search for wisdom you can read one proverb a day\nAnd if you do that over and over and over twelve times you want to read that book in one year right and I'm Thirty years later I have read it a bunch of times and I you know ... book wisdom and I you know what if you actually understand the stuff you will get wiser\nIsn't that interesting you know and here's what happens when you get wiser you life gets better\n'cause he couldn't do stupid stuff you know I'd have figured out the less stupid stuff I have a better life I have\nYou know it's fairly simple and you kinda get back what you put out your ... your so if you plant corn corn grows your plan stupid you grow up broken desperate you know you're gonna get a crop up something in your life what your crop gonna look like right\nLazy will make you pour and you work and you'll have money\nIt's not hard translation is it a ... causes poverty but the handle the diligent makes\nRich interesting\nDiligent what is diligence diligence as excellence\nOvertime\nContinued action was not one moment of excellence but continued excellence an ordinary things when you do ordinary things with the level of excellence that's called diligence and by the way that makes one rich\nInteresting isn't it the hand of the diligent which the hand hand of the Belgian makes one rich\nSo here's one of the things I figured out I read this study years ago and now observed it in all the millionaires we meet with and talk with and and it showed up again in this millionaire study that Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire projects you know we interviewed ten thousand millionaires among the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was\nIn San Francisco I\nDave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo I'm forty five and\nI'm looking to retire at fifty five I'm I have a pension and I'll be getting like Seventy five percent of my pay\nCheck in four one K. and stuff like that but um\n[noise] I've been recently started listening to you and I've already paid off some of my dad but um what's left is only about thirty four hundred but I'm sure I'll be on the path of Ninety Days ... um\n[noise] but my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F ha and so I have PM I\nAnd I\nI Do the math like the six thousand dollars and closing costs versus the hundred and eighty seven month ends up being three years plus my interest rate is going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do\nA study in the home longer than three years that's the only way you can wind up getting gravy on that biscuit right yeah for sure so um that's how you analyze it um that's that's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis I probably would not but if you're\nKnow Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point are making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a well I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYeah oh but where your interest rates go up and offset that\nHe well he acts like a three point seven five now and everything I'm getting a quote it is about like for\nYou know so you're not going to make any money\nSo is it better just to stay in it and pay the\nThumb and you're gonna be able to watch that you're probably gonna be at four seven five on a Fifteen year right now uh today and so that's like a one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six thousand\nOkay and so one in there at three years I've already paid off ten thousand about one\nPercent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year okay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year\nSo no I wouldn't do this if that's the only if that's the numbers yeah I'm OK bicycle breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I play the loan off\n[noise] and then I have one other question I just joined ... P U and in my area everybody's already in session but some of them have only done one\nClass that I still don't even go in yeah jumping you'll be okay\nAll right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already head of the game on that you're missing and you can go back and watch it on with your own line 'cause you've got a one year membership and you can watch or listen to everything on line for a year okay so yeah you go and watch the blessing one and then when you go in Iraq whatsoever zone listen to your right in sync\nOkay yeah no troubles are you doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christina ... with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have a a an\nIn Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have a a a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity\nAnd had steak moved to Boise how much but we um I'd say what is that how much equity\nAbout two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it yeah and um so we're here it gets renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or buying 'em but I'm not quite sure because we already have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\nOut of debt that we get go yeah\nWe don't have any debt good\nUm but do we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah what we want or how we ... we wanted we want where we you know we want something that's gonna cost us more than what we have okay\nWe'll put a small mortgage on it and pay it off real fast okay the only the only thing I mean well I mean what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and what what would you be talking about building or buying what price range\nOh price range between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty and the bank mhm okay so if we should for forty as an example Utah over two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right outright ... company that all five years\nWith dabbling yep yeah I mean just knock it out how old are you guys\nI'm I'm forty five and my husband's fifty\nYou have any money in savings or investments to this not in a retirement account\nNo this is all kinds of it [laughter] All right\nWell my role is almost never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that\nWay and then you'll\nBe close to that and so if you take out a two hundred two hundred fifty thousand or more you're going to really find house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars that's a long house that's wonderful property and from\nWhat we're hoping more real property then that the big house [laughter]\nNo it's a whole different world though obviously from where you came from rights and so I'm mean your bang for buck is huge in Boise compared to\nYou know a big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words\nI'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later\nAnd that's how we would do it because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever but if it's the only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show and in your case though just how the different mindset\nThat the mortgage is more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast\nI mean like other people's rate a car loan like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let's get after it and that's how I Want to think about it some really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car worth about eight ... Alvin ... pay off my about forty thousand dollars a day and start my emergency fund\nIf I should tell my car worried about eight to ... ... pay off my about forty thousand dollars a day and start my emergency fund and like hard paid off\nWhat is your household income about\nThirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen thousand dollar car ... you have too much tied up I don't think it's going down in value when you're how when your car or things with motors your wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income\nHow did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd married and we refinanced our house and included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and then we got a divorce and we sold the house and for the car was paid off got it okay and I got a car and\nSo what is your um what is your income prospects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRight around\nThirty thirty tail so you don't see looking at you know she just doubling then\nNo okay why I haven't got to school yet okay and I'm a single mother fighter and yeah you you need the money more than you need that car don't you\nYeah yeah I in the cars going down their value quick so yes Charlotte pay off your debt butcher emergency unemployed you can get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range\nOkay maybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nIn your debt free and you've got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position but as a rule of some cars are the largest thing that we all by that goes down in value anything what wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt's going down in value and when you have all of that stuff out of together you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your annual income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper in your case you're going to change your income by going to school and so I just don't change later but for right now I'm with you yeah I Would show that cost this is the Dave Ramsey show\n[noise]\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend a quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nSays Tom value of money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house I don't know it was risk neutralizes a lot of those the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interest 'cause we're there is risk when you have mortgage now it's not a lot of risk 'cause you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off by or an investment to pay it off but there is risk and so uh you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures occur on home with a mortgage there is rich\nAnd so I'm getting rid of that\nWhen I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before\nAnd those things are really hard to put on paper so\nWhat I figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in and I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so all of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if you ... if this discussion good sour on you and you think they rammed she's crazy a year from now just get you into the mortgage\nNo I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing to say is just if it's a lot of money I go you know I just go to bed and get paid off but my ... or\nDo you know I just go at my bed and just pay it off but my mind sort of just wrestle back and forth by ... ... what I'm trying to point out is is your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula\nGot it that's when I'm pointing out that makes sense completely yeah\nAfter you got this thanks for the call open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five she your heart's where he's not really you got your heart your heart's where you measure risk march telling me pay off\nMy house my hands telling me I could make more money ... money\nWith your heads missions from stop it's missing risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing to I was doing this with a clash of MBAs speaking to them and a cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I got a finance degree I talked to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teach us to borrow money and so um you know it's broke finance professor is like a shop teacher would missing fingers right people so think about this rise by ... ... you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show\n'em but there's you can really do a very\nSophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really on the radio to walk through the whole thing but\nWhat happens is is think about this how many of you if you had zero debt and you looked over in your four one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for your emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many readers said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I work for and I would go do dot dot dot\nUnless you go in business for yourself necessarily you might just have a different career you might go on a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting\nYou know and here's the weird thing is that saying you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you're going to live your passion you make half the money no you make twice the money\nYou make more money when you're doing something and you're good at 'cause you work harder at your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself from moving\nBecause you love it you don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog article I Can't keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down here and doing this radio show when I'm In town I was ...\nAnd I'm really good at it as a consequence incomes once I get paid a lot a lot of money on a shame middling I'm a capitalist pig baby I love this I'm here by me that's how I don't want that for you\nSee that's what set you up to be how many of you if you didn't have any payments would tell your ball she was a jerk to stick it\nTake this job and shut it I mean we would do that yeah there you go that's a man and I'm not\nTrying to quit your job today I'm saying there are benefits to being debt free that are beyond the simple mathematics of the fact you don't have to be interesting if you

caring\nChavez ABC News the White House yeah no that's absolutely going to be and it's going to be ugly and a and this is one of those things where you live on the coast you live in an area like this you know exactly what the potential is and it's not a surprise but that's why when you see people they're frustrated\nBut did they get it I mean I Lived there right\nI mean it's it's it's not like it's not going to happen again I can tell you right now in the future there will be more hurricanes maybe some this year maybe not for five or ten years but there will be more and that's the risk that people take and they're willing to\nDo so because they like where they live I mean\nIt's it's it's the people it's actually tried it sounds horrible what you're saying that that that Americans don't doesn't really care but you're right and it is not that America doesn't care now that I don't care anybody listening doesn't care what it is is kind of accept that risk that you live there were behind you\nBut it's like\nSorry to people want us to be mean does anybody really care if there's a massive earthquake in California it'll be on the news and maybe that that first one may get some love but fires the fires that devastated the west\nSome of them are still raging by the way and they've been for months some of them are still going they're still trying to put the handle on some of the fires\nIt's one of those things could you imagine a three month hurricane so it's it's one of those things were as Americans we kind of figure out okay where can we put our love and that's why it last year was so big with the damage it's huge and all that stuff because it hasn't happened for a while but these arrests that everybody takes to live in certain places\nAnd one of those is when you live in the panhandle you're living in Florida places like that the coastal Carolina stuff you may potentially be in the path of a monster like this three two three five three twenty four twenty three at your best in show is your Twitter you could tweet at us love hearing from each and every single day at this time\nSure like this three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned shows your Twitter you could tweet at us love hearing for each and every single day at this time we really bring it to you like a hurricane it is your urban word of the day\n[noise] half of

day thank you for saying that in dated urban place so that our understanding you that there were ... urban were of the day we damn stretcher cranium\nBeer lines being impacted the most are those that have lots of flights in the south east mainly delta American and the regional carriers Atlanta's airport who's seen some cancelled flights because they fly down to Tallahassee in Pensacola all flights in and out of many Florida Panhandle airports were pre cancelled and passengers knew they wouldn't be flying today\nYeah yeah it's gonna be tough and we'll see how long that\nUh how long Michael sticks around because the biggest fear a lotta times was storms and you talk to do do a lot of these people in my ... my best friend just got back from the Carolinas you got back on I think Saturday and now he's getting ready to go out to Florida he's an insurance gesture goes out and check things\nHe says the thing that's the worst thing that habit it's not the when all the debris and depending on how hard it is that causes issue it's the flooding\nThe massive flooding that does the massive damage and that's that that is this going to move quick and dissipate as it gets out over into the land or is it going to hang out and that was the fear originally as we talked about yesterday was Michael was going to come is going to be category too but with it bring a ton of precipitation and just kind of hang\nOut and dump a ton of water and then all of a sudden overnight it went from a tropical storm to a category to do it\nWe're approaching ... you know category four and five so we'll see what happened three two three five three eight twenty four twenty three actually I've been to chose your Twitter All right we've got the low information voter the no information border and the informed voter you got Taylor Swift you put it all together what do you have all you have American Red talk about that ...\n[noise]\nSuch adventure and show\n\nA good night's sleep is the foundation for good health not getting enough sleep can compound the facts of stress on the body not to mention lack of sleep contributes to premature aging in a way gate sleep is just as important as diet and exercise\n\nWho is giving away too much credence to in their influence in life says you should really get out and vote your lifestyle would I think I Would go for a tax cut idea\nPlease don't\nPlease don't we have issues that need to be dealt with in this country the Republicans have failed\nIn many ways to do what they were supposed to do when they had all of this stuff in front of him the Democrats again we have this two party system we're the only way you get power is if you hope the other side fails it's which isn't helping why should we help you because then you'll get all the credit\nSo neither side is really pushing anything with immigration issues that we need to deal with that aren't being dealt with the four years both sides if it were health care issue here in this country does a capitalist way of going about doing things but why in God's name does my phone cost less than a catheter\nWhen you look at the bills why why\nPlease tell me why we have real issues this thing called debt this massive thing hanging over the United states of America that is slowly but surely dragging down that has become a huge anchor around us\nPretty soon the interest on our dead alone is going to become such a problem\nThe interest on our dead alone is going to become such a problem\nThose are issues that we need to deal with but if your thought processes\nAre challenged with told me I should go ahead please don't\nTry to be a jerk I Want you to be informed you can't\nTell me the midterms were combing odd you know the majority was coming up well this is an interesting sound here ah MSNBC hanging out at Irvine\nBurbank, California check it out you see I guess hanging out there asking the students which would be in that we'll house of the Taylor Swift of the world anybody [noise]\nIs anybody going to vote in the congressional election in November you are thank you sir\nCool what about you oh okay that must have you on the bus so if you were going to vote what what is the thing is going to get your vote\nAnd I was gonna say you're not talking about the issues that they were talking about in the news all the time the Russia investigation of some sort [noise] you don't watch us though [laughter]\nNo they don't and I get it you know Donald Trump captured a a a generation of people that followed him because he made politics simple\nHe spoke plane he came out he was a bit rough around the edges and even though he was a billionaire people can relate to him he kept the simple stupid I get that\nBut they were trying to understand and I understand that somebody like you know Instagram influences and stuff and that's what they are the influences can influence people to do things and it's great that you want to be a part of it but the reporter for the reason\nYou know you're thirty seven year old man has got a small business and a wife and a couple of kids and you're saving up for college and she's in school part time and she's working fulltime and you've got a small business you may not understand the ins and outs of committees and culture and stuff like that\nBut you understand why you're voting and ... and and you don't understand that the the the weirdness of the politics and the rules and the and the other and that's where Trump came in\nAnd I get the fact that she's got to influence the issues are why are you doing\nWhy do you have to be coaxed into doing it\nAnd that to me was the issue and I love with this person says and this sums it all up about the generation that will do\nAnything for this can be your first election [noise]\nAnd ultimately he could decide whether or not the house representative of the Democratic or Republican control\n[noise] are you thinking about what [noise]\nI'm not currently maybe if I took more time like informed about like what's going on and off all the are you going to vote I said we're like the most unreliable voter demographics I send mode to like him [laughter] you know well that's what the Democrats want what they can't get on your business literally\nOther people and you're going to keep me and I'm like oh man\n[laughter]\nYeah but you know what tell them all they want they may even go register and there'll be excited about it for thirty seconds\nAnd then it'll fade away because they're on the fourth night there on to school there on Instagram the wrong to all of the other things the influences out there trying to influence and I have no problem but instead of saying something like hey it's\nMy way what you should be saying is hey get educated understand the issues don't be in a whole\nWell my way what you should be saying is\nHey get educated understand the issues don't be in a whole do the right thing to educate yourself it doesn't take long to educate yourself on certain issues and making real honest decision about something it's vitally important to who we are as a country and where we're going\nOh man it frustrates me ... I might\nGo vote for who do I get them both but there was\nNo you don't oh okay [noise] so is is trust the crazy\nI was sitting there last night and I'm and I'm On I'm seeing this and people are all excited and you know and the Twittersphere in the Instagram and all of this stuff is happening and they're all talking about this and that and people were energized by it and I'm thinking to myself you weren't energized before because you don't care\nAnd sometimes people care too much and you know sometimes my characters broke my bucket full there's only so much I can care about\n\nBut if this is what it takes to get you cross the line and you weren't going to cross the line in any other way shape or form\nAnd it needed\nThis to have happen I don't want you to vote other people say oh it's good that happened no I don't think it is\nI don't think it is\nThere's low information voters and no information voters low information voters\nThey come around every two or four years and they vote and they try to get you know caught up quickly in in the world and and they don't have a lot of information or an understanding his politics is crazy and again it's it's\nSo see she you do the best you can no information voters are the ones that are like this and that's what I fear more than anything else three two three five three twenty four twenty three ...
