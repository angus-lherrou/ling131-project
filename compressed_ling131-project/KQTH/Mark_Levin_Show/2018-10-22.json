room she owns a AAA eight to five five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you I'm good how are you have better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchased our life insurance and we got part permanent impart term\nAnd of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nOn the insurance about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and could we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about whole law permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you do is it still bad\nShall we still didn't get the terms\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey\n[laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clear on the lesson you heard me\nYeah when you never tell you under any circumstances to huge life insurance and investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would so you knew or knew financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a presidential advisor you have a life insurance salesman okay the shelling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand just of term H. and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which I'll do a lot um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things are you this guy's a lawyer or he's are ignorant\nBut he's a family friend who's in the um actually one of our friends just apparently gave them our number because they use and for it as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which it is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance doesn't investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight in the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy was until we were eighty with hand\n[laughter]\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything you sold you know guard and you're probably going to just cancel and everything with him so this guy really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like well Oregon I Do I'm In the end of this week\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about you\nIn the end of it right All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return\nRegardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been on a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal\nIndexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever now I did get\nA horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than Fifteen to twenty two year term\nHi anything other than\nFifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you\nThe best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nWhether it's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance\nLong term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind letter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance out by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually a north local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your corner homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state formation foreign nationwide in Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide in and out but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIs one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plant\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them home with a mortgage\n\nSo we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answered questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up times and then down times\nEnjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been

on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... that these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate or if she make some money that's just a bonus right\nBut what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired and a lot of us that are entrepreneurial or a a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know sense\nThey're getting ready to have a kid go off to college is shopping\nAnd understand\nFor college costs because it is one of the most bizarre things to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of color just the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and colleges across America we're now in forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stop of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization\nWe'll pay for that high school to have foundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it and paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good\nNow Tyler Moore is with me on the line and tile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle White uh go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here and the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the difference are like so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct\nWow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I meant we'll get him to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world need more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that\nCan be anyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that in her spare we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAt pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right vessel decorate\nYour football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as good I play on words but you you guys got the you got to the table first where this way to go man I Love\nIt it's a great motto and it goes it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have as a coming on\nThis and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is it going to have as of coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are a state that is very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nBecause sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line I've talked to a lot of ... around the country a mile and chancellor in ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nThe ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition of doctor are renting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that\nProvide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping a student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nThem in so many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over a twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nNow that's a good size school that's not too big and small that's a that's a that's just right those are ... deal to us right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and\nWe appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot and so\nNow it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school\nNow if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states some states have more high schools and others can you imagine\nYou know but uh um you know maybe you just want to do it would be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to them in the building\nBut uh um you know maybe you just want to do it would be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day and smell middle school\nSo I had all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me\nAnd that's the hardest speaking you'll ever have all this trial yeah um but now as Anthony all males got tough job you're all but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and and you know if it wasn't and by the way that school has our

at least as much as you can tell by watching an animal answer ... is a conceit of human beings\nThe fight over her captivity has been going on that long but a lot of folks failed to recognize she served a purpose like I said we used to call them killer whales and back then the public didn't have the positive view or cause that we do today Lolita helped popularize her own species and fueled the demands to protect them\nTurner loose today and she's likely to end up dead in the ocean just like Kay go the killer whale debt\nSo large large and show them how wonderful line taking the AIDS Tucson

the lucky machine so\nWho knows maybe the winning mega millions ticket will be sold right here in New York City so do you have a lottery fever that is a very good question because it's now over a billion dollars cash values about five hundred and sixty five me in dollars you're probably gonna walk with about\nThree eighty to four hundred million depending on what state you went in and whether or not they take taxes some states are tax it it's in say now I I Love you guys you love me we have this this thing going on right well we're we we talk we debate we have a good time\nOr listen to this 'cause this advice for winters I think you need advice for winners because\nSomebody potentially this weekend and potentially to people this week you know several people as we can are going to want it to his money\nWe're also getting some very important tips for these potential new millionaires Ryan and Mary ... an twenty twelve they won two hundred two million dollars and when it comes to spending they say winners should pace themselves\nIt's great to have a second home but then great to have car in a boat and things like that but there are a lot of other costs that come with that property taxes insurance and gas money that goes along with that purchase good advice there\nWhen combined more than one point three billion dollars are up for grabs right now so good luck to oh\nYeah huge money this weekend so here's the thing and this is what I don't think people realize\nPeople win the lottery writes somebody wins five million dollars after everything they walk with two and a half million or whatever it is they end up walking with the cash value in ... and everything so they take the money and then I go out and they spend right and what they don't realize for a lot of times people that when these have never had money\nThey've never made six figures let alone getting this massive when will they get the money and\nThey don't know how to replicate the money meaning they don't get the money to work for them and they go out and they spend it and then they can't replenish it so you've got to realize if you laugh you know twelve thousand square foot home you got to heat that you got a cool that you've got to pay for the property tax you buy a hundred thousand dollar car it's not a thirty nine dollar\nYou know oil change right\nYou buy a two hundred thousand dollars a million dollar car it costs money at the ... it's like thirty thousand dollars is the oil change or something ridiculous like that these are the insanity things that go into the so when you have to think about how much\nDo you want to just go hey look this is that we're going to take X amount of dollars you know a million dollars to a million dollars were this'll be are fun money are play money will get the gadgets we're going to get the rest of we're going to invest new smart things with a lot of people don't do that and they don't know how to replicate it and winds up happening is they give a bunch of it away they overspend and they look back and they're like wow\nWe're screwed and we don't know how to replicate this three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you

[noise]\nIt is it again it's another one of those ... did it pop up at the right time and is it going to help for Republican voters may energize them\nThe negativity\nFor some people out there in the potential of what may come from this separation sending army all of those kinds of things and what does Mexico going to do\nIt's being stopped as of this moment by Mexico so we appreciate very much what Mexico so but as of this moment to see what's happening is I think so\nYeah they're they're trying but I don't know how much that's really going to happen that's been in the end it always feels like they're going to stop but they're going to stop it but you know Mexico's been complicit in allowing people to come here and uh\nYeah and it always feels like they're going to stop it they're going to stop it but you know Mexico's been complicit in allowing people to come here and\nUh some of that out of spite some of that out\nOf a you know look you can go\nYou can either go there you can go back from when she came those those are your choices right here and as we know with Trump eighties about enough is enough\nA percentage I think fairly big percentage of those people\nAre criminals and they want to come into our country and they're criminals and it's not happening on my watch that going to have\nYeah and I would say I like is it a huge you know\nThere are some people that come here that are bad we can all admit that is a is a large percentage no I Do not believe so I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's a negative ghost writer I don't think it is I think it's a lot now\nInside of the mass of people that are that are coming here or there are people that are bad\nProbably right with any large group\nThere are going to be some people you go you're going round up you know a thousand or two thousand people doesn't matter where you are what part of the world there's a good chance within that group there are some people that are probably not good people if you have a random group of people to the tune of two for three by whatever it is\nHow many of them probably small but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't stop everybody I mean at some point\nIn time we have to make a stand when it comes to immigration don't I mean how do we owe that aid to to to the American citizens to the people who've come here and done it right to the taxpayers\nOf this country\nTo our constitution to the rule of law do not only that we must solve something I think we absolutely do\nWe are deeply aware or that the the way that Mexico will handle this way you will handle this is your sovereign decision or Mexico will make its decision if leaders and its people will decide the best way to achieve what I Believe our our shared objective\nYeah\nAnd as far pale right there because they're all trying to figure out what to do in one of the big things that is potential ... and and this is the thing right here\nOne of the big things is sending the military we've seen in\nThe fight them sending it were militarized seeing and you know the border and we're doing all these kinds of things will what have you done Republicans what have you done Democrats to solve\nAny of this nothing you play a game you ignore you kicked\nThe can down the road you use it when it benefits you politically and the rest of the time you just ignore it from comes along for better or worse he says I'm going to take this is the mantle I'm taking up when it comes to certain situations\nBut border the wall symbolic that's the way I feel it is but the reality is is for a lot of people they want something done there's a bigger question here and if you don't want that wall\nDidn't fix the immigration issue if not given as damn wall\nAs you know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border if this is a [noise]\nAnd it's a night I have a feeling and this is just me I have a feeling that tonight when he's speaking here in Mesa that he is\nTonight when he's speaking here in Mesa that he is going to\nSay he's going to send the military but he can make some sort of an announcement that he is going to to send the military down there to stop and to turn people back I have a feeling that's what he's going to do 'cause he's\nWhen he comes to these things this is one of those things people like do you think's going to say anything crazy is that well first of all Trump is he is a person that is\nHe feeds off whatever they give him the energy tonight will be huge crowds already lining up to see him or massive it's incredible to see what's going on\nHe's going to feed off that and if they're feeling and he's feeling it yeah I think I think the reality is he he's definitely thinking about it he wants to put in it he I think sometimes other countries don't take him seriously until they taken serious because they've paid a price for it\nWe got to figure it out and Mexico was the one right now that\nIs either going to put a stop to it or I think that they're going to look if there's if those people are allowed to come through there is going to be some issues not only with the new trade agreement but also with the fact that you're going to be sending people\nLike the military to the border we have many challenges but his way of just proven with our trade agreement we can with mutual respect for the sovereignty and rights of each of our two nations tackle these problems and I'm confident that we will resolve them together\nConfident\nShall see we shall see this as Mexico's foreign minister minister uh Lewis a v the gallery\nSomething that we agree fully with the government of President Trump and secretary from there and then moved to serve the cause the root causes of the Central American migration particularly to create a development opportunities\nYeah yeah that's a centrally what it is\nThey're so corrupt and there's such a mess and while we well I have every right to blame the Republicans and Democrats for the failure to fix immigration here when it comes to the continual immigration\nYou have to look at those nations and say you guys have failed your people tremendously you're continuing to failure people and they're coming here and that is not good for us and that sure in the hell not good for you because you're corrupt sellouts\nWho were incompetent that's it and that's why you're countries
