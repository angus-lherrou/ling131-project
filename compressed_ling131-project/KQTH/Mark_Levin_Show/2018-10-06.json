how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement in college when my one year old mhm I'm I'm I'm Thirty years old\nI'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I put Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a chat five twenty nine I think for him and and kind of\nPicking out some growth stocks mutual fund to kinda see where it goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I deal with this kind of pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know every any given monitors about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shut shut draw towards my how he owns a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so uh about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a I have a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory\n\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent or Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay\nAround eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently has just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the oil and high hundreds\nFor me I'm I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game there'll be a time in a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but\nWhat I Would do just go to smart bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business I don't care what you do okay I had an effect my income at all\nBut I people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there are fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread in my in personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international\nNow once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with you've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart Mr pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's baby step three is ... by babysit force Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different being there in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget\nOr any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget almost keep junk and on that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nA day I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up already\nSo I have ah currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't got a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty abnormal currently with the U.S department of treasury on it as a result of having been additional service academy or three years ago\nAnd the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue paying off the small as that\nI've started to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know her back that will eventually end up in a collection the cow if I'm not able to pay the amount for um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWhile so you learn to you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can give you got wonderful income you'll be different\nTwo years it's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start doing twenty thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou have to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either at the surge through in the service or you're assigned to\nThe recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S\nTreasury so you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enroll for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back wow\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring\nMedication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you know\nOf of her checking because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind\nI rest my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of initially\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling and so for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff but\nIf she doesn't she gonna hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again borrow you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a in numerous number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling\nA medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only did he medicated but she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want them just you know you know all the rest of their life is\nI mean they add controlled or she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen or as as as really mentally ill and she is voices if she's not on a couple of different meant\nWell her ... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four in all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nIt happens to people all the time so what did she say right now when they call her and so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nAre you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you just you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should\nBe telling them either want to be I'm not going to long conversation it's got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ...\nThe situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the death right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and\nI are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're going aren't\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not given or any no so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you're going to give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight hundred there does she say look at can we work at a deal yeah or you know they\nGot Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years from now back up and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in a settlement in full will do it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account\n'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's still the industry so you got to treat them like rattlesnakes 'cause they are you got to really tender covering person here who's going into\nRattlesnake soon after she starts making some money you got to walk with or emotionally on there you can you can give us a cheerleading supports that she needs without giving them money and I think you're right to do all of that there's good news show she can make it out of this year she makes good choices\n\nOkay things are getting really weird out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info up half\nOf all Americans now we have breaches affecting

I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money oh\nI'm paying on and I'm paying all his death he still has about um\nFifteen K left on the equity loan\n... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house and how much are you able to put on the debt I'm putting everything most of the turnout to auto everything on on that much\nMoney does that amount to\nWhat is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIt it will have on the car eight on a house and chew on a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done in a year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right you're going to get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in the steel plant to understand that right yes I was going to come a moment and they will come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year mhm and that way you that free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah not ideal\nNot what we want but we can probably get there\nAnd uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get dead free then let's build an emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some mistake for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency fund in place\nAnd is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good and what I'm asking is why a bank loan um someone at his age fifty K. and uh you know four and a and to be paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is is they're counting on the house I've got to lean against the house right now that's true\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral is part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is\nYou know asking a banker review should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might\nBe breathing and ...\nSo the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes we will go oh they wouldn't have offered me the\nBut in a forward it and it's like no they would I'm all for the dog that credit card so I mean in dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoin' Pi Day I got to require retirement or OK\nI'm here about a year and a ... mentioned that will have a well we all know\nWhat he good mhm I quickly there are at sixty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it goes on for we have for the whole time of day\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to see other words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more than a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking out your four one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely [laughter]\nYeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... death I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers including infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire Hi Todd how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better\nThan I deserve how can I help\nWell I'm I was I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask your question and I just

agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay I Want you to do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say with thousand dollars if you've already got money saved\nThen we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except your home busting your debts\nSmaller slug you attack those because by getting rid of those that famous and now you've got the ability to invest\nAs baby stuff so that book

University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency\nA no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of their enroll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an e essay and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and\nIncreases in price to twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right\nSo how much of an increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving a growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last\nSeventy odd years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time\nMinded and so you make more\nBy putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I don't want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget crank your lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a a help us going through a few for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ...\nTo my question because this is a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen or we were my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should say\nShout or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want to ... you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one reason west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down that there is no boom okay I mean when the gas for five dollars a gallon it was a boom baby I mean\nBut a million and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say uh I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have\nTo sell all of them you have to sell although at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none are what ... it's it's simply a they're looking at the three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five perhaps\nOkay so you're just added on how they're going\nYeah and my biggest concern is the risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars in the middle kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market might crash yeah well it might but I Know I got to tell you start getting less rock\nMarkets less risk than drilling holes yeah we're hundred percent sure that you don't have I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be an old person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\nYou know this is I'm I'm helping uh my mother and father and make it to say\nOh I see so it's just they they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yes okay All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay\nI probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and a ... you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted\nOf my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not some advise that have families entire portfolio three million dollar net worth out of it\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me [noise] as a financial coach they do that I Would say no [noise] I Would\nI I Would take the majority or\nMoney off the ties thanks for calling into [noise] the news to have a blessing like that do\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that are weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are a toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped\nOne of the ball game over there and the he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is whether it's Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nHiring today how you doing better than I deserve what's up in your life\nWill miss out at the end of August I'm I have a friend who has been following you and she gave me some information and I had been struggling at the single parent and I just got a new job in the

I I don't miss paying much higher than I\nAm a Christian you know my income at three thousand the money is everything is not adding out and\nGot you know how much is your house payment on a on treatment for rent okay and how much is your car payment on it to Ninety two a month okay I'm not sure on their car and they have eight thousand less so that's not bad\nBut your your take home pay three thousand thirty six thousand a year so that means you're probably making about forty five thousand before taxes is on right\nNow and go home at each paycheck is a thousand in something so for the month with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about nine Ninety ... till about three thousand of my you know out of an income\nOr a little over three okay uh well you don't have a lot of wiggle room heroes and two boys um ... but let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills and then trying to eat I Want you to eat and then try to pay bills\nWhat that means is is that we need to start start doing a written budget\nWhere every dollar but for the month begins you look at your paychecks and what they're going to be you look at your child support what it's going to be\nFor this month before the month begins in you assign every dollar and so we would start with Todd off the top you said your tie there that's cool I'm that's the first thing we do like ten percent off okay that tie this done now what are we gonna do next what we're going to eat\nSo second thing you do\nYou eat so you do your grocery budget and you set that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your lights in your water\nOkay then what's the next thing you do you do your you pay your rent guess what after ties food rent and lights and water there's some money left but it's not a bunch\nOkay he probably got Fifteen hundred bucks left if I did my calculations correct there give\nOr take right\nI don't know what you want to know and they don't even have that much left there was a food um but you know he probably got twelve hundred maybe but let's just call it a thousand you know after you just you run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus my checks minus ...\nMinus ... my my uh food bit budget what am I set up for food and a minus ... minus ...\nAnd the kids have eaten before we do anything else out now we've got a car payment or they're going to report that thing and we've got to put gas in the car\nHow much is left only then that we spend money on something else\nBut you can't go buy
