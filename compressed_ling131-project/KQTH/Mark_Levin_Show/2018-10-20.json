than I deserve what's up\n[noise] [noise] okay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance park before we purchased our life insurance and we got part permanent and part term\nAnd of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nA dark insurance about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and said we immediately wanted to get rid of the term are All right the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about her minute insurance not or fully a base permanent insurance which is what you\nDo is it still bad shall we still didn't get the term ...\nDoesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] okay Dave Ramsey doesn't ever invest I was real\nTo use life insurance as an investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhen I Would say you need a new financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you\nHave a dull life insurance salesman okay the selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do it switched to four hundred thousand jets the term H. and then that money where your because it was like three hundred dollars a month but I don't know why yeah um and just go ahead and open up our by Ron R. IRA and start getting money into that and\nThen then mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class wasn't yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he did language tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's ignorant\nRight [laughter] he's a family friend isn't T I'm actually one of our friends did apparently gave in our number ... than for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know about but I Do know that I have never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nNight and then the last thing it on our current policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy within ... eighty wet hand\n[laughter] okay why don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything he sold you\nOkay [laughter] okay\nAnd you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like well Oregon ... I'm In the end of this week\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return\nRegardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to forty years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out in these even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your body and that's where you should be when you\nOr five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value\nPermanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into\nThe investment that money is gone so you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all\nIs a bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey is always at four twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is all I have owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever\nNot did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything\nOther than\nFifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the chops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr that your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind letter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that's the other a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeffers done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd then also your name to a list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed him it's real simple and takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance when cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again\nSo Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker ... you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with could get with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property and casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance you can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car\nAnd homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major foreign nation wide in Asia [noise] poor Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and you know [noise] but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that but you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you this is the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\nFolks this is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time
