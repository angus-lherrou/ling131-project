[noise]\n\nShut shut adventuresome show\n[noise] ... we hold ourselves accountable to ensure the university nothing but the best every act ingredient in ... we make sure that it makes our quality standards of being on ... percent all natural\nRight I'm completely committed when when\nAll the facts in front I make a decision I don't blindly go I'm voting this way or that way but everything has\nTo be it's my way or the highway it's like in this situation it's ... if you support\nKavanaugh because you look at the politics and and you have cynicism in this right like I'm cynical because of the way this is is played itself out I think anybody who's reasonable would feel the same way\nThen all you have women right\nBecause you need to support or you need this or you need that it's us for ... for us versus them so many critical why isn't us versus them once the U.S versus them\nThat's the way things are designed as Republican versus Democrat is right versus left it's black versus white it's gay versus straight it's man versus woman heat is so stupid it really is\nIt is it is absolutely and and what that does will become more and more like that will become more and more a slave to the echo chambers\nRight chained to our tribes if you will change or red and blue or Democrat and Republican we we we're we're we're there and in we we serve them and it's it's not right I mean you've got to mind is the greatest thing in the world be free thinking be open minded\nWhere we get stuck in these things and it becomes us versus them\nAnd it is it is very frustrating like I can like you can't even keep an open mind and enough to go\nI look at ... and I find or to be credible I think the things that she did I think that was a a a friend take away whatever she was talking about right like take that out of it 'cause I'm trying to explain this to see you take that out of it\nJust put it in the context of what she had to go through being a person who really didn't want the limelight who the Democrats wink wink nudge nudge through or into the limelight because then you would further their agenda\nThen she had to come across country and the world is watching her not just us but the world is watching her she's friending she's she's she is a you know she's now pop culture and all these guys\nSo that it was like wow right like I could sit there and oh man that's ... that right there a strike they you know to look at Kavanaugh and to go through this stuff knowing full well what he was going to go through from junk\nAnd it doesn't matter who the next person is no matter what side put somebody up for something to know that your going to be facing even Kavanaugh said yesterday I expected some stuff I didn't expect this like anybody that\nYou can sit there and go well I've I've got some admiration for you because it is it is an ugly horrible thing and and knowing that parts of the the globe and in America I hate you and the other parts love you and neither side knows you is it just really\nBut we turned everything into us versus them and I was talking to a couple of my friends who work in the er the political arena and and and are fairly well known and they said look you know there are a lot of people out there on the Democratic side\nThat\nFeel like this is a big sham\nThat this was definitely an overreach but because of the peer pressure you can't say anything and there's a lot of people on the right that believe lazy for a little bit more and have serious questions but because of the situation there in politically they can't say anything\nAnd so somebody like Jeff Flake could because he's got no skin in the game anymore he's done he's not running for reelection seats up everybody knows that\nSo it it it's just like the people out there a lot of how many people voted for Trump but if it was a robot that called you do one of those you know those surveys you might have said you like Trump if it was a human being you are less likely to say that because of this fear of judgment and backlash from people because we've created a tribal world where it's got to be us versus them\nAnd that's that's not going to move us forward that is that it's absolutely\nNot going to help us at all three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and show was your Twitter how\nWe lost our ability to joke so this guy's name Jared Hensley he's an assistant principal and he\nLike they have those I now I mean I didn't have this bill did you have your radio and TV school at your high school oh no not at all yeah now now they've got all these things in high school which I think it's really cool so he was part of their news program and they were talking\nAbout [noise] he tapes something talking about the dress code\nBoys you're thinking you know I don't understand why it's not fair at least we'll go past your knees\nI didn't like the rules I kinda did but that's the rules so this is what we're going to stick to and that doesn't mean that you can wear athletic shores and if you really want someone to blame brain when the girls 'cause they pretty much ruined everything they ruined the dress code\nWhat can they thought it was really all you're really getting into that you can really go back to being a Tom\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] so\nHe starts there and he continues and so [laughter] [noise] it's one of those things where if you watch the video he's laughing but we all know in this day and age it's not how it's meant it's how it's taken\nPTA where we're going to go in with that [noise] remodeling with that little bit take that down a notch\nGuy will than I save some for the honeymoon it'd be fun so no no no kissing and hugging the halls we've we've seen enough and uh you know on on your own time I really want to do that either on your own time but you know as long as a matter of time I'm not going to be there or are we watching\nSo he was just he's trying to talk about the dress code and then the way you're supposed to act and now he suspended or he's in trouble you 'cause you're blamed women and he's not administratively and you can tell in the video 'cause he's laughing but it's it is a joke and it's all off the cuff\nBut that's the danger of today because it only takes one person to say something because we live in the world now where it is the fleet that wag the tail wag the dog\nMeaning it only takes one person to to get everybody riled up over something and that fear factor we talked about everybody's afraid they'd be an independent thinker\nAnd to the greatest thing that that that that our mind or God or whatever you believe in as ever given us is is to me is reasoning\nIs what separates us from the other critters crawl on this land right is ... we were able to read certain things and [laughter]\nA normal person\nOne reason and say this is stupid right he's joking he's messing around\nCome on\nBut you can't because the parents going to be offended or a politician is going to be offended or social justice warriors going to be offended and they're going to want action and the only way that is going to start to stop and it doesn't matter what we're talking about when it comes to like the social justice war you're taking to the world with his version or any of these things\nIs when companies CEOs or you know organizations whatever finally started to say\nWe've had enough\nWe're not going to let you try to influence influences ways that you just what were they influenced you there you go we're going to get you to change because once they get you to change once they're going to come after you every single time\nRight like a bully goes in and he says give me your money and you give it to him once he's going to do it every time he comes in and he has a you decide you know what no\nAnd you take him on and you scrap with him even if he gets a little bit of the best to you you know what he's going to stop doing coming in there because it's not worth\nLook what he did was supposed to be funny doesn't matter if was supposed to be funny if it's a comic because we expect comedy to be funny or\nMaybe he gets away with it that's why I was telling me that you you you look at the likes of of of the people that are out there that do what we're doing and and you know whether it's Joe Rogan or a lot of these other people\nIf they get away with this\nIt's because they don't care what other people say they're a they're controlling a lot of work showing that aren't that's nice but be we're expecting that from them and if you can't take it\nThen they can and so you calling them horrible names doesn't do anything for them\nThey just realized exactly what you are and that's why they go after bigger companies because they can get you to easily changed because they know they're terrified we've talked about for I've talked about do several CEOs that we've had on her shows that have all said the thing they they're terrified the most stuff\nIs somebody saying something or doing something on their Instagram and Twitter something like that that they're going to have to fire a good person or get rid of a good person or change something because one person out of a million doesn't like it\nAnd until we start having people that have the ... enough to stand up and go you know what we're we're just going to say it is what it is and move on with our life and you would think more people do it because the reality is we have a ten second\nWhen you're little readers and ... and it was a\nKnown will be no way in in ... or\nYou need\nWay it was made up
