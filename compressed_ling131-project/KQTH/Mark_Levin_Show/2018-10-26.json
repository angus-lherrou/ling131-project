name's Ken Coleman host of the ...\nRamsey solutions media productions and thrilled to be sitting in for Dave this hour triple eight eight to five five two to five Tripoli eight to five five two to five is the number to jump in and let's go to Cody who's on the line in Seattle, Washington Tony Hawk and how\nCan a thank you for taking my call so I'm\nAbout five years and she my career field and I teach in cyber security and um I currently make a hundred and five thousand a year I'm I've completed a all of these baby stopped so I don't have a wife or kids\nAre and then they have all yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job that is less stable\nOr than a full time and it pays a approximately three hundred thousand a year a primary care to control thing and ah I've I've been raised with you know try to keep a stable job um you know you could go on\nFive days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and uh but I I think since I'm pretty young and I don't really have you know I don't have to support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on a either staying at my job or taken this position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome or the or the field itself I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going a job but like a chore or anything like that I I and I enjoy it so yeah I'm a opportunity to uh to take the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half\nOkay it two times what you're making OK so where's the stability she meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so it's consulting so I you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be out you know work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're gonna make three hundred ... that's pretty clear correct\nWell that that's even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got around the earth All right\nBut is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\nOr ... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in that position and um and they they say that that's about average um yeah OK yet but they they've had some months where they they get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby step seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it what is your three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nIt that Fifteen thousand\nAnd here's the other thing you've probably planned for it how ... what is your uh three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nThat the same outline\nYeah I mean you sound a little bit how long would it take you to get that up to thirty or fifty you know ...\nWhat fighter position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're killing it the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me yeah\nSo I may be uh celebrate tonight my goodness don't oversee this I mean half of half of the eyes is going to love to be worked ... right now [laughter] I mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um\nMan and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff triple eight eight to five five two to five is as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city in for day to go to Rachel is on line in Madison, Wisconsin Rachel how can\nI can think back to talking to nature I'm I'm twenty four years old and right now I'm working in the legal industry I'm but I'm not no lawyer my role and they're catching coordinators so basically I'm working with differing marred Courtney their program during bang\nMy ankle ... however I don't want to work in leader administration I Want to work and to get our industry\n... do you think might train God gave me transferable skills how long should I stay and well let light I'm job ... and if I only stay wind a two year the next protection\nYou know you will look like your job hopping at all how old are you a twenty four\nOkay twenty four I forgot to write that down so here's the deal you're pretty much the average millennial who looks at a job we knew this from data\nThat looks at a job is no more than about twelve months so first of all that's out there and it's not job hopping you left after six months you've been ah in the legal world and you now know very specifically where do you want to go so congratulations of being twenty four\nAnd and knowing where you want to end up so uh the first question you asked me are your skills\nThat you have manifested in learned in the legal industry transferable to the business industry and the answer is absolutely yes\nStew a quick example here tell me a two or three or four things that you do really well right now in your job if I interviewed your co workers and your leaders what would they told me that Rachel does very well right now go\nUm I Would pay them on and concert this and then probably our collaboration or one of my big wrong very big jogger could trigger out\nOn who's doing what program and then on the other side of of a nation or a man who is doing something similar in that and kind of match them together and figure out how to get the ball rolling involved traction\nUh everybody in America as well so that going wow that is extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody who can do that\nAt the bar or animal traction yeah uh everybody in America as well so that going wow that is extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody who can do that [laughter] pick\nThe industry I mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I told my audience this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty seven million jobs available in the United states seven million\nIt's historically there are more jobs available then there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great at systems and processes and you're really good at collaborating with other team members that's extremely valuable\nI Believe there are people listen to the show right now or go I Wish I could talk to Rachel I'd interviewer tomorrow\nSo you need to have terrific confidence there now you asked me a resume question here's the deal you put your experience out there you're you're twenty four years old so they take that into account you don't have a Fifteen year work history you're twenty four\nAnd as long as you are open and honest as to why you're moving I think a a solid hiring managers going to ask you why are you interested in working here and you just tell them\nHey I I was in the space I really have a love of administration I Love leading people in systems and here's why I Want to be here and so I'm Rachel I Want you to go to Ken Coleman dot com\nOkay right now and download my free resume resource\nIf you haven't already we've had over twenty five thousand people download this just in the last few weeks and we actually address what you're talking about right here what should my resume look like what are hiring managers looking for the average average hiring managers spending\nReady for this less than a minute six to sixteen seconds looking at a resume so it's not as important as you think it is what is important relationships in in this resume guy I'll teach you\nHow to structure your resume show you an example tell you why do you do it that way how to use relationships ... where you want to go to get you that and it's not as scary as you say [laughter]\nShe got a creative resume that serve oh sure and it's got to be attached to a relationship that they don't care how important they just want to know how can you help me win [laughter]\nWhat hiring managers don't\nAre asking for the ranch\n\n\n\n\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nI Need to get in proximity now the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances or who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take them out to lunch or taking the coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is a place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your path\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow uh what do I need to learn who else do I need to do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available 'cause Nelson this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation let's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is\nYou say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say hey can I just shadow you for a day I'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nAnd those new people will help you get in the right places are going to open up doors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your body that's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is people in places\nSo again\nFolks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you\nIt is people in places so again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you\nHe needs to simply asked today and then start to ride it out and find the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some intention alley and some hustle that's all it takes triple eight eight\nTo five five two to five let's go to Joe who's on the line and Charlotte North Carolina Joe how can I help\nBut he can big fan big fan of the whole blaming the organization appreciate all you do thank you so I'm looking at a kind of continue this you know I'm Wondering I'm Wondering if\nIf what I got as a hobby or district career so just a little bit of a back story after I've been paying job that extra benefits to pursue I thought was my passion I take it a fifty percent pay cut to to make the switch\nAnd and I went to this new profession you know I'm I'm quickly right in that I don't know why are they from that I think I might have jumped the gun I just want to get them in fact probably\nWill tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial devising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick rundown\nA day to day ah basically just knock on folks doors ... who I Am what I Do and you know trying to get them to be with me so that I can help them with a retirement plan in education\nSo are you working for a local firm or do you open up your own shop\nNo it's it's a it's a national um\nOkay so they're not providing any leads a toll on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they'd provide zero lead okay\nWhy did you jump into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause in plant financially but your question was is this hobby level you know is this the right thing for me and and and I you know there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly why did you jump for this why financial\nPlanning\nSo you know I've been with a good day for the last ten years crowded and you know I always had a passion for maybe being able to help folks with it finances and clean out retirement\nOr when I went to a fair you know kind of holding my story you know that you're going to make a great fit and um you know just just you know trust in the process I I went ... went with it in a shift that it's not working out\nWell did you plan financially for this\nOr someone you know I had about three to six months of expenses which of ah quickly depleted ... and uh you know I thought I was gonna you know and I never got that always had I've always excelled though you know I thought that is really no different go in you know kill it you know and and and ah you know I look I'm working on commission\nHave even al well here in the way here's the situation you went after a a\nFinancial advisor role that's what you went after because you want to sit down and help people with their finances with the problem is you signed up for a door to door sales job that that's what's going on and I don't know\nIf straight commission sales the thing for you the reality is you need to get some feedback I mean today from your leaders are and maybe some some of your co workers to see why\nThey think this isn't working in pretty quickly you got to make a decision or and so maybe it wasn't the right place maybe it's the right thing but maybe it's not the right places he's got the talent to give people advice and coaching 'em and you have the desire to do it maybe you're just not in the right format and writes setting to be able to do that so we get some feedback\n[noise] um and you have

very well thank you for taking my call I'm sure what's up [noise]\nWell um [noise] I think ... is that down there's three and a half ... my husband and myself and um my dad passed away two years ago the mom on the line with us [noise] so um she couldn't\nMake it on her own so we just kind of combine our income um\nOur monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars I've done the everyday dollar budget and\nWhere like forty seven dollars and not over budget as things stand now um\nWe had back in January we had an identity theft going on in our account and that it is I think twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the bank to our overdraft this to\nSo that\nI mean why would the bank charge you anything if there was identity theft\nAnd be well it was ... was charged to account\nTo know but if it's identity theft of banks shouldn't be charging you anything\nThey did and they said there was nothing they can do about it a lot can change banks yeah we did okay wait we actually\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they can do about it\nA rock and change banks\nYeah we did okay\nWait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card that um it's like one of those little Walmart orange you know we don't even go through the banks anymore mhm it's just a debit card but um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars and overdraft\nMhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm\nBut down here in that time because that was going on we got behind on our house payment\nAnd I'm a couple of more things some of the smaller next that we had well we out the smaller and I said but we're still have a hand on our house I've talked to the housing loan people and they're working with us but we're having to pay extra a month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys fifty nine so I'm fifty nine and a thick the and mom Seventy nine or\nAre you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nYes it's a disability out three of us and none of you were able to work you know I Do a little side business with crafts and things like that was the nature of your disability um man is a hip displacement what's wrong with him\nUm he had um a as a and broke his back uh-huh and he has a um\nA piece of the bone and begin close to his nerves back mhm and he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he has a defeat the later and mhm so he's got like twenty five percent of his heart beating so\nMhm okay um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right\nDue to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel and showing it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars\nMhm okay\nAnd that didn't involve any heavy lifting obviously and involve the keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nMhm wouldn't it it was really a yes or will be dramatic and how old is mom mom is Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven\nYeah she passes where you don't get a real problem\nCorrect\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house primary\nUm they were four Seventy eight they've increased it the fat\nThat it was that's one of those on your nails that's just due to taxes and insurance going up ...\nYou know China and what's the home worse\n[laughter] oh it's worth a shot at a hundred and ten hundred and twelve\nWally oh twelve five only wondering you know what\nOh it's a hundred and twelve ... twelve only want to goodness yeah well I sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do\nA ... you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you are but it man a thousand dollars a month\nWould change your whole life thousand dollars a month for a year and you pay that house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change you feel like you were rich you are multi millionaires or something\nIt would change your life that much and so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or whatever\nIt and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation with somebody over the phone and sell them something\nRight and that that's a possible thing you can do um the you know\nAnd it doesn't cause you to work forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... you're struggling not 'cause you're lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here\nMan it would change everything for you I thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nA day and how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes or does it get in on dad what are we paid it off about ... ...\nIn your eyes or your pan away from a financial perspective is a good time and I think that they could cause she wife's getting kind of pushy and all that and I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one on a kids' faster than Sharon ... who she won but I'm\nA I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that was crazy but you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to be ready to have kids and God says is okay to have kids\nDon't have kids I I don't I don't tell people that need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you went to a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice everybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise yeah really\nOr as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice everybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise yeah really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not that is not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of I'm way if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children I mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife\nAnd you guys are in good shape financially smart and you're already moving in the right direction you want to start now it doesn't bother me at all [noise] this is the day rams you\nDid you know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal info compromised or act over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had\nWell thank you I had an idea that the other hand it keeps the honesty keeps you don't know definitely yeah once you do that it's game on\nBecause you can't you can't not do the stuff in the class and making a different kind of accountability you know it just it it I mean if you're a person of honor anyway you know I mean I guess you could go in there just lie but yeah it's it's just very hard\nWell congratulation knows we had a copy of Chris ... book for you on the moon

old\nOkay All right I'm buying a house was not a bad thing or your first goal is you know when you're working on it is to get clear the death the second goal is to have your emergency fund\nOf three

the way that aren't there to help but I'm saying how do you go about doing that how do you get that many people that are willing to to jump on board is their contract you sign I'm just you know it's it's curious\nI think we're allowed to be curious I I don't know what's going to happen they're they're having issues some small towns of taking some people in the custody I don't ... in the overall scheme of things\nBy the time it gets here I don't know how big it is going to be and it's going to be one\nThe things by the time it gets here I don't know how big it is going to be and\nIt's going to be one of these things where this will be a little something for the next few days if that the bombs have overtaken it but eventually unless there's more bombs and they don't unless they find somebody it'll dissipate and then it will become this again and then this all this debate and then it will get bigger as it gets closer\nTo the borders and I said borders because I think eventually it's going to break into bits and pieces and you'll find some staying towards the Texas side some will head towards Arizona some other ones are towards California\n... ... but I just I I don't know\nI don't know and this is one of those things where it's like is a perfect example\nWhere I was talking earlier somebody of of you know most of the time when I talked to somebody who we differ politically on certain things\nAnd I think most of you guys if you you were smart enough to understand that 'cause I like to think that my my ... my listeners and people to pay attention are smarter than the average bear and even if they are politically they slant one side and it's pretty solid they're open minded enough you know more often than not we want to get to the same place we just differ on the directions we want to take\nRight\nSome of us want to get there as an individual some of us want to get there on the bus some of us want to get I mean some of us are gonna walk there we we want to get a lotta times at the same place it's just\nThe way that we the route that we're going to take how we're going to get there and who's going to pay for it along the way\nAnd I think that the more we start looking at things like hey that's a that's a good you're right we do want to get that we do want good education we do want how I have yet to run in somebody in in on the Republican side of the aisle if you will but says oh I Would like for for nobody to have health care\nI think everybody would like to for everybody to have health care it's just the way that they want it done is they like the individual to be a part of this and they understand\nThat there are people out there that are capable\nFor whatever reasons in certain circumstances that they're never gonna be able to themselves and for that\nThey got no problem and the other side is like well everybody should have\nAnd we don't want the same thing it's just how do we pay for it how do we get there what's the best route to take where's the compromise in the same thing for immigration I've yet to meet anybody on the left except wackos who won't open borders right\nIt's just different and how they want to enforce these things it's\nIt's the same you know it's it's that kind of issue we should be talking about our cars okay we we agree that we shouldn't have this so how do we go about fixing three two three five three twenty four twenty three actually I've been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at us loved hearing from you each and every day\nIn the United states of America at this very same time we\nLike to roll something out to you that just lens at your feet and it's even got a handle and you can pick it up and you can use it how you will we called us or urban word of the day\nIs half of the urban word of the day I Am right now time to get a little more hit on the streets can't understand a word you're saying before\n[noise] now this was very interesting I was like a wait what because I heard this I Am a ginger\nRight so ... you know the red headed person that changes the genes used\nBut somebody said to me [noise] I heard this I'm like what is this like it's it's rained ranger I'm like what is that they're like oh that's another word for changer like wait wait how did you get to do to how\nFor changer like wait wait how did you get to do to how does this happen for for ginger but like yeah you didn't know that I'm like no no [noise] yeah you're yeah you're a ranger I'm like with a W [noise] that means you're a ginger\nI'm like I have no idea you guys come up with stuff every day I'm so glad I get in the loop every once in a while [noise] ranger pure urban word of the day thank you for that and dated urban place so that our understanding is that there was an urban were other day we damn structure cranium it but I Will say that\nThey said you're a ranger kind ranger like because it also means somebody with ... and ... and I never had ... now I did get a knock on the line there\nBut I didn't have paid now my sister she had red hair and she had the ... and when she got like ... when she got signed oh goodness me she just went\nShe which super frankly I never had that issue richer three five three twenty four twenty three ... Benson shows your Twitter you can tweet at us so your bombs mega millions gone but if you're not\nOkay so it wasn't that big a jackpot but now you're thinking that you really could have used that more than six hundred million dollars would last night's Powerball drawing well you get a little bit you know it matched all of the numbers in the multi state lottery that means Saturday jackpot grows to an estimated seven hundred fifty million bucks\nYeah still a lot of money right I mean it's not that kind of money but it's a pretty it's a pretty big amount of money crazy right\nI drove by today it's did said seven hundred and fifty million on this thing but the other one always said forty million the mega millions like oh that's kind of sad [noise]\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three at your best in show streets where you can tweet us ... Megan Kelly right you thought you were talking about costumes the next thing you know you're on your way out of here talk about that ... [noise]\n\nSuch ... adventure and show [noise]\n\nDo you like saving money do you like knowing someone has your back as you're getting older and starting to be faced with the reality of Medicare and the future of Social Security my partners at the association of mature American citizens otherwise known as a Mac or focus on protecting the interest to mature Americans meaning anyone over fifty I'm partnering with a Mac\nSo they do that\nYet a lot of people were on there that were jealous over who weren't huge fans of her anyways and she came from that place that dirty plays that dirty evil place that's on the ride that dirty even play so she'd you must be tainted\n\nSo she's going to get sixty nine million dollars or what's left of her six million dollar contract to walk away to negotiating a settlement and and then the settlement may go she'll get\nDoes she do thirty five they may say we'll give you twenty five but we won't restrict you and what you were able to do meaning you could go back to Fox which is what the rumors on the street there's been a negotiation for this\nAnd the thing is it's her numbers weren't good winning so a lot of things we give people\n\nAnd I I look at this and say the way that the people at NBC has come after says to me\nA lot that maybe she was in his lights\nThere as\nShe would've liked to have been some of that may be the fact that they just couldn't stand her and others might be her attitude was horrible and so because if you loved and you do something and\nYour numbers are good people are more apt to forgive you and also people are more apt to come out on your behalf and say oh this is stupid I Know so and so I haven't heard a lot of that\nI have\nNow do I think it's ridiculous of course I absolutely don't you I mean can you be honest with yourself\nThat you kind of think it's a little ridiculous right that you kind of\nJust dismayed like there's this major of of insanity in something like this but we live in a world now where this is what it's all about it's all about\nPunishing people it's all about the punishment how can I punish you what can I Do to destroy you\nPunishing people it's all about the punishment how can I punish you what can I Do to destroy you I don't just want to\nGet you to apologize I Want to destroy you I Do and here's the other thing she comes out she started to show off like this\nI'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWe may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it'd ever okay for a person of one\nRace to dress up as another a black person making their faith later or white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume and wound okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nAnd I thought to myself who you apologizing to\nCurious we see all these stars come out and apologized like Roseanne had a human beings you should've apologized right when she did that tweet so you understood that but you apologizing to\nAnd that's that's one of those like we we want everybody we we demand everybody apologize\nRight Samantha be does what she does do a bunker Trump you need to apologize to her doing whatever way you want you want to come out but the mayor cope with to the world is if okay good because I couldn't go to work unless I got that apology\nBecause I was underneath the bed curled up in a fetal position terrified for my life but now that you've apologized whoever you are apologizing for for whatever you did\nAids okay ... thank God oh\nMy God I was so worried [laughter]\nThis is the stupidest thing in the world\nIt's like when when nor McDonald was going to go on uh the Tonight Show and then people came up and they had reservations about him coming on after the whole ... thing and there were people that were well they were ... they were visibly shaken up but I think if you're visibly shaken up I wouldn't know McDonnell had to say you need to go get yourself some help\n\nYou need to get yourself some help\n\nYou don't understand what don't I understand that a celebrity who you've never met\nSaid something that you don't agree with and because of that you're upset to the point of visibly shaken\nHas anybody listening ever been visibly shaken up to the point where you could not potentially do your job whatever that job is because somebody tweeted something said something\n\nAnd I'm not talking about your wife or your husband your girlfriend you bought from your son your dog whatever I'm Talking about a celebrity\nHave you ever been and felt that you were old an apology\nNo [laughter] [noise] but it was a villain I Will ask you have you ever felt you were owed an apology for something by somebody who was famous no doubt that we go so there's two of us I'm sure somebody's going to join me ... you just don't understand [noise]\nNo I don't that's why I Want you to explain it to me I Want you to explain it to me and I ... but this is the power and and here's what it is and make no doubt about it is a power play\nA lot of these things NBC did not she struggles has been at NBC\nBut it is and make no doubt about it is a power play\nFor a lot of these things NBC did not she struggles\nHas been at NBC right hurt her show and her numbers of kind of been in the bumper\nThere and part of that is because in many ways she type cast herself as the person who was on the right and the whole nine yards\nAnd because she was on Fox so by default that was going to happen but also because she dealt with a lot of political stuff that not everybody wants to come on your show that that trust you because of Fox 'cause they're all caught up in you know this crap so\nThat was a bit of an issue so nobody really got a lot of people couldn't see past\nThat point of who she was\nSo her coming and saying let's talk about recipes or let's talk about online dating people weren't buying that even though that's what she probably want to do she wants to be the next Barbara Walters the reality is is people never got past\nSome of that\nAnd I don't think she was from what I understand and this is only a couple of people that are that have worked there a is across the board she was not liked some people were jealous because of the massive salary and felt like whoa\nWe were here and this is what you're doing and other people were like she wasn't really love there\nAnd she didn't really and Gracie it herself on a lot of people and she wasn't super humble about it and she made her presence known and sue [noise] yeah [noise] I don't know a lot to do it\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had mentioned shows your Twitter somebody's totally get attacked me and\nSay you know what I felt I was deserved and apology I've never felt like I deserved and apology for anything you don't want to you deserve an apology\nIs want to start or a celebrity does a movie and it sucks the album sucks like look we're sorry that sucked\nSo we'll do better next time I'm like oh you don't have to apologize but that's nice right or when you go to a like like how many times you get seen as your team sucks it stinks they're horrible Arizona Cardinals right now\nLike Dale and apology to a lot of people who pay good money to go watch them and they've they've really not done well there's an apology there I can understand that we apologize to the fans and I because they pay good money to come here and we let them down because we were all\n... okay okay I maybe understand that but I ... when when somebody comes out and apologize I'm like who [laughter]\n... ... is there is there's somebody in particular Valerie Jarrett and and and Roseanne I get that but\nThat was to her it's not like everybody else was like oh good we got our politics right Valerie good because if you're not
