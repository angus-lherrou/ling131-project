UPA during today's\nWelcome\nBack some Lars Larson job glad to be with you on a Wednesday night and blended take your phone calls and your emails on march teasing joins us now\nWho's the fellow a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in a great columnist for the Washington Post one of the few conservative people at that paper Brett or you say I was going to call you bred mark ... welcome to the\nProgram today I view it it\nI I Want to tell you something before we get into Kavanaugh but it kind of relates to Kavanaugh where the me too movement start with Harvey Weinstein and in that case and I guess there's a big development in that case that one of the major accusers of Harvey one state they found a bunch of emails and things on a computer she left behind ... job\nAnd it turns out she had a friendly long term relationship with a guy although she apparently described it as she said I hate feeling like it's a booty golf and I'm Wondering if that whole case is going to start blowing up in front of us and in since it's the\nSort of the the bedrock of this whole me too movement it started everybody taking a a tough look at at the bad behavior of some people\nI'm Wondering what effect that might have I was I've been reading that and I got a little discombobulated so I'm\nOn my first reaction is that one out of like what Seventy said generally you ... and and to even if she did continue to have a relationship like a ... like talk you know I mean Monica Lewinsky\nWasn't a a wasn't a or unwilling participant it ... it was a power relationship that was unjust president United States of the White House ... like you know it's been under and that's not even power situation so she could very well have been depending on Harvey Weinstein for her career\nA and plus trying to keep it as good graces despite a sexual predator predation so I don't think that that's necessarily dispositive and you know\nNot not necessarily story but apparently there's a bit of splitting the da's office about whether or not those charges should be drop blood talking about capping off because I'm sure ... yesterday or earlier this week Hillary Clinton comes out ineffective lease not effectively she says you'll get incivility back in American society the you know all the\n... and the you know the nonsense and the violence and the shouted threats and a visiting senators' offices are now there are options their homes in the middle of the night all of that will end when you give us power back\nAre are we going to be able to you know are we going to be able to have a a civil society or other Democrats simply going to say will cause trouble 'til you give us the reins of power back\nWell that are are you and looked at I mean I don't know how much lower you go then accusing somewhat of participating in organizing Gingrich [laughter]\nWithout any evidence whatsoever of but apparently they you know according to Politico the Democrats think that they are the lessons from the capital experiences they need to be more ruthless just root for mind boggling more ruthless and they've been the case I did that we are are we are just\nWe're we're just all kinds of old and the pursuit of power will do anything to get our and their two principled into kind and too soft and so you know they're they're they're that's they they need to be tougher as what they're taking from all this which is just you know I mean the fact of the matter is that what the left\nOr and so that they had no power whatsoever to stop capital and then the second thing is they always overreach\nYou know that Christine Blasey Ford has her story started falling apart but at least there was some issue seem credible to most most Americans disassociate volunteer or something then they start coming up with the pepper a mirror store ... piece in the New Yorker and then Michael have and that it comes out with this ridiculous you know these were ridiculous a\nAffidavit that you know he was standing in line to wait his turn with girls and you know all the rest of it and then gang rapes and just it it\nYou know they overreached and so the lesson is not\nTo to to do more of that the lesson that mean that literally helps confirmed Brett Kavanaugh because there are charges are so ridiculous that Republicans that Israel is able to say to themselves look this is just absurd\nUh and I don't believe either those charges and bloody or salty not true either so they actually they actually helped Kavanaugh's case by going overboard and by with their attacks on first on Gorsuch and then on capital so the lesson is be smarter stuffing stupid\nWell and I guess I Hope you don't mean by and I think the Democrats may say being smarter means we have to have a better pack of lives that are less track of all you know and and a better set of stories and I hope they don't do that but frankly mark\nLook I Know I'm critical of the media and I mean the me I'm part of the media but I'm critical of the mainstream because I don't think they're doing their jobs and I want to I Want to know if you joined me in this because\nYou remember when when David Duke was supposed to have endorsed Donald Trump and and they said well I mean Donald Trump has to decide claim that connection right away Well Mark I guarantee you there or at least a few people listen to my show who may be nasty\nIndividuals you know I think the vast majority are nice folks but I don't know everybody to listen to my show there are millions of people in the radio audience so\nYou know somebody says hey there's this full on begin from Alabama who just he loves your show and he hates everybody in the world because of their skin color race religion et cetera and I say my response would be I don't control would people think\nAnd the fact that he likes my show or endorses my candidate for mayor dog catcher whatever does not really mean much of anything\nUnless I embrace that endorsement well in this case\nI'm not seeing any ... any members of the mainstream media going to politicians right or left and saying and especially in the ... Barbara Boxer and Chuck Schumer and the rest and said will you condemn these tactics\nThe tactics where violence is done where you know about the protests are made and and you show up at the centers house in the middle of the night and harassed his wife things like will you do that they will go to Donald Trump in believer in for a week\nTo say please come out of displaying David Duke which I think at the end of the day he did um but but they're not doing any of that in a case like this so they pick and choose when does say it's a major story this week good you know that that senator so and so will or won't a disclaimer this kind of behavior or by people who were advocating against Brett Kavanaugh\nDo is there any reasonable explanation for why reporters would say well it's not important to ask\nThem if I asked yeah they're biased I mean why does this I honestly there's so many hold up and poked into Christine Blasey Ford story that somebody an investigative journalist ought to be going out and saying well is there some coordination here was this all plant or ... you know the way it is\nBut still talk to people enter high school and find out a little bit more about her or let's talk to find out like where's the coordination between Senate Democrats in her lawyers or how did the story leak\nWhy I mean we ... we still don't know how Christine Blasey Ford's letter came out and to the press that there's a there's a lot of stuff yeah that that is worthy of investigation and I don't think any of them but I Do it [laughter]\nNo they have no curiosity to draw because it doesn't mean they were to find out yesterday metals\nLost over so why why should\nKinds of time on on other lesser things like you know whether or not to certain people in the Trump Administration at very low levels of campaign or\nYou know allied with somebody else but in this case where it actually controlled whether or not a man would become the Supreme Court justice that he is today or whether his he'd be ruined and his name be smart forever I'm no no fury audacity there at all and and and I just\nI just wonder if these reporters or have any any self awareness of saying we're because they'll tell you that they're unbiased that their objective journalism they're just telling the news well then why not treat those stories equivalent because the Duke example was maybe a poor one but\nThere are lots of examples where the press will spend inordinate amounts of in time and energy tracking down he is there a connection here or not and you had this one is like not not even interested in looking into it\nWell it's just I mean the address is really just you know the cloud itself and the whole philosophy for them and just as\nCheap the is an eddy charges like there were even credible to treat the Ramirez story like it was credible I mean is it just it they say they complain when Donald Trump talks about fake news but then they ... the whole fake news me him\nWith their behavior against capital a so I think I think a lot of journalists really made fools of themselves and the whole process of current and uh and that's a they'll though the first is people are paying attention to it where they're losing our because there was ...\nYou wrote a great columnist way mark thanks very much for the time\nKnow Lee Harvey Oswald not exactly a right wing conservative if you know what I mean and so the left uses these kinds of tactics there right does not\nWhen antifa shows up in your town be sure to have the fire department and some police or an ambulances on hand when the Tea Party shows up on the Capitol mall in Washington DC they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived\nSo is there a reason to do that this isn't pointed out routinely I Know that most reporters working for TV channels they want to find a kind of a moral equivalence well both sides do it\nActually that's not true is not backed up by the facts is not backed up by history so when somebody like Hillary Clinton vows that civility we'll only returned when the left gets its power back\nIt reminds me of a four year old in the grocery store in the cereal aisle with mom who is screaming at the top of his lungs holding his breath well it'd be screaming you can't be holding his breath but he's screaming at the top of his lungs and stamping his feet\nAnd civility is only going to return when the captain crunch goes into mom shopping basket we understand it it's not rational behavior but it is the kind of behavior you expect perhaps from juvenile children\nIt is not the kind of behavior that America ought to have to tolerate coming from adults simply because they identify\nWith the left side of the trial let's go to Cindy Cindy welcome to the Lars Larson trout what's on your mind tonight\nOh hello life I was told that show that fish they want to show if if you get the civil eighth\nThank you very much they only say that so we can spend most of the time your point\nOkay I thought that the credit tight deplorable fish and itchy and taxpayer money trying to cap and not be a sexual predator\nAround finance Hillary Clinton democratic rally tore get ... ...\n... exactly and the guy that they have an eight\nYeah and you did you notice Hillary Clinton saying well the charges against my husband she actually said this week\nAre were different the accusations are different and I read that I thought yeah they were different because the charges against I mean Bill Clinton never contested that he had sexually harassed and molested Kathleen willy who came to the oval office asking\nFor help he never contested that he had to elicit an illicit affair with Monica you know uh and and he never\nNow of course he would not admit that he raped Juanita Broderick but that story is so well founded and well evidence and Juanita Broderick who's been on this program not long ago just for a couple of weeks ago during the whole cabinet business\nUm she explained that she\nTold somebody about the assault the rate that Bill Clinton put her through within thirty minutes of it happening and she remember the details you then told other people in her close circle of friends and she told them why she feared reporting it\nBecause the man who had raped or Bill Clinton was the attorney general and he controlled the industry in which she owned two nursing homes the attorney general of Arkansas that time maybe still\nA controls the nurses nurse nursing home business he had the power to put her out of business so you know Bill Clinton was accused accurately\nSewing Hillary says they were different I'm sure that was in what she meant but it's what my response would be your bed it was it was a difference\nAnd the charges against your husband is Ann Coulter calls him the horny hick from Arkansas were very well established\nBy the way how does a great night sleep improve your performance I Know what it does remind how about more energy less

you on the type two diabetic\nAnd I got a nice new gizmo and I'd I'd done been telling everybody within earshot about I've had it for a few weeks now and it's cheap it's called the free Sally brand no we don't do commercials for them although I think you sound like crazy ten percent of America is diabetic\nAnd I have to keep an eye on my blood sugar has never bug me to you know use it a little stick thing to stick your finger and get a drop of blood and tested but it's kinda disgusting if you you know I wouldn't want you're doing it next to me on an airplane or in a restaurant\nThis thing is a little sensor about the size of two quarters stacked on top of each other and it sits on my on on either right or left arm you can put it on your biceps backwards not going to get brushed off and it sticks with some really incredible glue\nAnd stays there for ten days and anytime you want to check what your sugars you just take this little meter and you hold it up next when it goes beep and is not just measuring it at that moment it's\nGet records it are you on while his on your arms so if I don't check it all day long and then I hold the thing up their downloads all the data from the last you know seven or eight hours or whatever\nAnd it gives you a little grafted shows you here's where you ought to be and here's where you've been you know so when I eat salad for lunch or whatever and the numbers are still in good shape it's it's a good deal and\nThose stupid little finger stick things uh that I've been using for the last four years or so they're expensive and I know everybody says well insurance pays for it will remember we're all paying for the insurance so\nThose things can run you a buck a strip and you might check your blood sugar four or five times a day is four or five bucks a day this little center on my arm is about thirty bucks and last for ten days so it can actually be cheaper than the other version and you can actually kind of track and say oh I just said this would that do to my blood sugar if I had something an hour ago\nAnd it's it's really kind of cool and you know I like gives most anyway so I thought I thought I'd tell you and and actually if I wanted to or needed to I could plug this thing into a on a pad or a computer and transmit all the data to my doctor not that that's necessary in my case but I kind of cool deal so\nWell it's also good and for things like that whether it be your car your body or whatever to keep track of how things are going over time you have to you know there's a nominally I have a lot of people that say well my phone you know doesn't last forever ... do you know ... forever eat and eat [laughter]\nI mean did it ever last ten hours it ever go eight hours and they said well it seems like you know are\nLike Peter's running slower my our guys all these things or whether it be your blue your blood level your blood sugar levels or or your car range gas mileage if you don't keep track of that data point over time you know idea that something's wrong and so that might be a\nA good reminder I was just looking at this you'll you'll be happy to know what's covered by Medicare for those who qualify\nOh see he's ... he's making a he's making a micro aggression on me by by mentioning gotta than in in about six months or five months I'm going to be sixty years old so I'm not qualified for medical and by the way I had to get a prescription for this damn thing and I told my doctor and she and she says you don't need this medically and I go\nYeah but I Want it I I Want to try it out and pay for my own my own money if I have to the meter itself is like Seventy bucks and it'll last I assume it'll probably last five six years you you charge it up with the now ubiquitous minute micro USDA and to be not to see\nAnd I have to charge it I don't know once every ten days or so and it's it's really kind of handy and in any way I I think it's a it's a great little innovation and it sticks to me and there's a tiny little filament that sticks into my skin but when I first put it on its side all feel a little stick like I Do I pay my finger didn't even feel a thing it's like holy cow\nI Need a prescription to prick yourself with the old school that\nWe see this is a ... I don't know if they ... I don't know why because I said to my doctor I don't understand was prescription anyway and I'm not asking for a bottle\nI'm asking for a meter it is like getting a prescription for a tape measure and she said well I don't either but but uh but you have to have one so I got belong to an hour and I said hey I Want to buy one of these and they go now cancelled so you have to have prescription my wife when I\nWas just stupid and and frankly the little cheaply meters at Wal Mart they're like twelve bucks and you don't need a prescription and the structure twenty or thirty cents apiece so interesting you know you can save some money but there's a beauty if you actually made people pay for it I think the prices would come down but because they're like oh it's covered by insurance\nSo they just say well we can charge you know I my wife was stunned a few years ago I said well you pick up pick me up fifty tester so I was using one of these one ... and they were already ... says fifty strips of sixty five dollars on why\nWhy well out of the game and the insurance companies anyway let me ask you about this let me ask you about gender filters on job sites\nIs that a form of discrimination\nAnd is it legitimate for a company to say we're more interested in males or females in this particular job and do you think they're\nDoing it and yeah and it and then the question whether they're doing it or not we'll get to in a second and I'm going to the fence on the side and I know you hate that but let me give you both sides of the coin here on side number one the argument is\nThey want more diversity and hiring they want the candidate pool they want page one page to page three of the results to reflect the overall mix of gender now the reason they haven't had\nAny consideration I Believe develop or is it linked in now of course owned by Microsoft had done a really good job of keeping gender out of the equation the developers have said we don't want to even enter that into the data pool we don't want to know about it because it's not necessarily relevant now what they're saying they're saying well we want to encourage diversity\nBite subtly encouraging if there's a a sixty percent female applicants indoor pool of responses to your linked in that we're going to put sixty percent of females on page one sixty percent of females on page to and so on and so forth so I get the intent I get the goal I get the purpose\nI'm just not sure that I Want my technology provider like linked in can be shoveling\nThe result in such a way they could consciously or unconsciously\nDetermine who I hire I Believe the best candidate should be hired guard lists of race and that's where the ... question comes in or we now putting that front and center on the same token I think we can all agree anything that helps that company be my more diverse is a good thing so it's really\nActually I'd probably disagree with you there just because look if you're going to ask for the best candidates Brian if God Forbid you end up in the hospital you you've probably been once or twice the number one that has been there with family members I haven't been in the hospitals are patients since I was a kid but\nIf you do that what gender will be the predominant gender among nurses I Would say female female and\nI've looked at the numbers would something like eighty five to Ninety percent so should we told our hospitals will you should filter so that the job done as you look at her fifty ... actually fifty one female forty nine men would you accept that\nAnd say you have to leave it no go ahead\nIf if the lark if the market is eighty five if you say you walk into a hospital the market is eighty five percent female\nAnd and you get eighty five percent female applicants now that number may vary five ten percent one way or the other but at the market as a whole is eighty five percent you know\nYou're gonna get eighty five percent female applicants so the question is are you getting the applicants for the first place the question is are you seeing the same mix of applicants page after page after page well and the results would ultimately be the same\nGuess I I Would just rather they rank order people and said here the people with the best test scores were the best one ever metric you want to use a measure their capabilities\nFemale or almost all female sold her well do I want the best ... I don't want the nurse in in the proper rainbow you know with the diversity actually I'd once more Republican nurses and stood Democrat nurses that\nThat sounds fantastic well get the Republican nurses\nYeah well you know I don't I don't know I don't know how many nurses are going to ask them I I mean I I don't know we probably don't\nI just I I don't care I mean it's like I Want to be like Ronald Reagan late Ronald Reagan who he was brought into the hospital after being shot he said well I Hope you're all Republicans at an end to the doctor Phil mess with that Mr President today were all Republicans but see I don't I don't have the poll of Ronald Reagan\nYou know that means the economy is producing more goods and services now my question to you our says when you get an increase in the output of goods and services\nWhat happens is the price of things if it's a it's kind of meat producers more apples what happens is the price of apples to apples doesn't live it falls yup so I reject this notion I'm so glad you mentioned this\nConcept of overeating 'cause it's a bogus cuts that you know we had rates of growth of eight percent under Reagan you remember that why can't the economy grow up four or five percent\nIn China and India had some tremendous growth rates as well\nIt's kind of moment do I do I did plan to ask you about this what you call the credit rating agency racket described as for my listeners about how these government agencies have been ... you know putting the USDA approved stamp on a on a whole bunch of credits that really doesn't deserve that and and they helped create some of the problem right\nThis is one of the great scandals of the two thousand seven and two thousand made a real estate\nYou know a crisis which led to a belt out in the economy which was that that we have these credit rating agencies the two big ones are Moody's and Standard Poor's and allow ours up almost until the day the you know the banks collapsed\nAnd the mortgage market collapsed these agencies that are supposed to rate the credit of the debt\nThey were ... basically giving AAA bond ratings to all of these mortgages that were worthless and we now know that they were just you know I'm you know practically worthless because people are walking away from the homes and my point would be why why are we still relying on these credit ratings\nAgencies that they still dominate eight percent of the market and they've got a terrible track record a related to that I'm not trying to scare people but did you know ... hours that to this day ten years after the crisis because the crisis yet exactly ten years ago virtually the day of today\nI'm the I'm the federal government is continuing to provide one hundred percent tax Arab guarantees on three and four percent down\nPayment loans they learn nothing from no back door and exactly what we're doing the poor and\nBy the way Steve mommy I Want to make this personal I Am a producer who just bought a house and he was telling me gosh\nI said what are you having trouble getting the down payment together he says no way they engineered it any good credited and he's a decent job working for me if you can go about a decent job and he says one they've worked it out so we have to put one percent down but after the ... the purchases complete we actually get the one percent back\nAnd I said to effectively you're like well I agree I Want and yet\nI understand why when people find that in the marketplace they don't say that's great you know they say well that's great my son or daughter brother or sister or whatever can buy a house and you say yes and they have almost no skin in the game which means if things turned south they can say well we don't have anything in this place let's just walk away from it which is part of the way\nYou know who gets you know get screwed the taxpayer yes we we care on TV it's mortgages that's why the banks snakes the mortgages even when they know that the person may not\nPay it back I mean it's just it is so infuriating and and I do worry a lot about it because if you got somebody put one or two or three percent down payment on the low and that and let's say this house falls in value by ... percent\nNegative equity that means that they're better off just walking away from the home and that's what millions of people did and the taxpayers got old ... you know got a stark holding a bag\nOf a trillion dollars of bad debt\nOr doing it all over again and that's the problem with government they never learned the lessons from the last place as\nWell is there any way to back away from that or or make is slightly less attractive you\nKnow I have a I have a solution Florence ready yeah it's a very solution or throw\nThat you could throw out the uh you know the um the what was the law the or that they asked to sacrifice his that was the I'm a ... a frack a tank and uh what was the other guy that Frank remember that yeah do you do need that all you need right just ... dollars all you need\nTo require five or ten percent down payment to temper sat down payment on the house is that asking so much somebody puts ten percent down payment if you do that\nNinety percent because I look at the laws that failed almost all the laws that detailed thousand six and seven and eight or those below five percent down payment laws so let's just ... well that that that ... percent down payment and you will have a national crisis like we had the you\nKnow and in fact as I understand it in Canada I think you have to put down as much as thirty percent down and uh and the as a result they didn't suffer nearly as badly as the United states did Steve thank you very much he is the author of fueling freedom\nExposing the mad or on energy Steve more from the Heritage

at\nEight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com well as we keep telling you the economy is booming so loudly that a lot of employers can't even keep up should they get tax incentives to fill the hundreds of thousands of jobs out there\nAnd there are a lot of people who may be ready to get a job but do they have the skills to fill those jobs\nJobs out there and then there are a lot of people who may be ready to get a job but do they have the skills to fill those jobs Peter Murphy is vice president of the invest in education coalition Mr Murphy welcome to the program\nLaura thank you for having me great to be with you\nSo tell me this um [noise] we have a situation in America where we have a record low level of unemployment I tell people that I'll be sixty next year in the last time we are the unemployment is low for the whole working population was one I was nine years old\nAnd the last time we had female unemployment is low I was a dream and my friends or a ... it was Nineteen fifty three\nSo if we have this record low level of unemployment we have a lot of employers hiring and we have some in millions of Americans who are willing I I I don't know if they're willing to work\nBut as far as I'm concerned if they're working age they ought to be working do we really need to provide tax incentives to ah to get employers to fill those jobs\nLarge we have too many Americans that don't have the skills to fill their jobs and I think that's really what this is about it's not a kind of an open ended a\nTax credit thing we're talking about here at the bill that we are pushing\nA ... by a congressman Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania it's called the usa workforce tax credit act that it would allow up to two billion dollars a year\nThat's a fairly modest some but it's some it's another spoken this we'll another a policy that was tough on that other efforts that are designed to get\nMore young people in particular a skill ready to take these jobs that are going unfilled right now\nNow if I go bold fashion on you because I'm now old shortness officially and I say well if I wanted to learn construction and I I was I said fine if I'm going to get off my up and go out and get a job and I'm unemployed even in a in a situation of an economy that seems to offer employment in all directions and employers begging for that\nI think I'd go to a construction site or a construction company and say can you put me to work\nAnd they always need people who are what I called mirror fog or somebody who can fog Amir as qualified as you say you can start sweeping up no I mean there's a cleanup guy in every construction crews sometimes more than one\nAnd when the young man's or one young woman says but I Want to learn how to do drywall or hammer nails or I Want to I Want to learn how to pour concrete and finished concrete and say well we can teach you how to do that\nUm but you got to start at the bottom and if you did that I Would imagine that is the people who've been the mirror fog or jobs before move up the ranks that there will be\nGaps they're an aren't some of the jobs that are available or that can't be sold or it's a tough time to fill them in those kind of categories where people just say I don't want to do that job doesn't sound very interesting it sounds physically challenging and it doesn't pay very much money but that's where all of us including me started in our jobs doing the jobs nobody else wanted to do\nWell from yours truly I mean my summer jobs didn't look too glamorous but I got a lot out of it and uh and built from it so I'm really what we're trying to do though is to get a more Americans skill ready for these positions\nThere's not enough to fill them and we're not moving quickly enough to get people to a skill level and I think too many young people are going to college which is not the right choice perfect\nI couldn't agree with you on that\nAnd I think you know even industry is responding to that by going to a job fairs and sending represent a isn't going to guidance counselors and say we've got five figure ... figure jobs here that these young people can fill it in a year or two and nine and current college debt at the same time\nAnd saying we've got five figure ... figure jobs here that these young people can fill in the ... in a year or two and I'm In college set of the same time so a lot of it's just industry having to take extra steps that they didn't have to take before um and we're offering to accelerate that process\nSo we don't go month after month year after year potentially\nTrying to grow it four or five percent and then the economy and not feeling these jobs I mean there's other risks with that that you know we don't want companies going elsewhere or overseas to fill positions or or move operations or anything so\nSo it it just designed to you know we we have a job for me you have the government spending programs to a career in textile education let's let's get the private sector more involved in\nBuilding these positions in in investing in workers and ... and then adding more apprenticeship opportunities and as a school choice component to this bill as well or getting children in a better school though they're graduated college and career ready as opposed to sit too many of them now who are neither\nAre too so this will be two billion dollars as a practical matter how has the money gets spent so if if I'm an employer and I hire somebody who's currently unemployed has been unemployed for six months when I get the credit or how does it actually weren't\n... ... the way it would work is the\nThe investor early in the the employer or would go to the Treasury Department and actually apply for the tax credits up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth\nApply for them in a rant either a random selection or first come first served the Treasury Department will just managed to the program ah and it's just on at the state level in other areas where you literally apply for a finite number of tax credits Mac with a ceiling two billion a year\nOr those employers would apply for them\nAnd uh they get approval almost like you're going for a concert tickets on line or something it's a similar kind of process and the cat you know automated process and ah they get the credits and make the investment\nAnd you know report that accordingly and\nBut when you make the investment does that mean they say I Will hire somebody who is not currently employed into a job and I'll provide them the training to like I said if it's construction to do she rocked to do framing to do a you know a concrete foreign Yoon finishing ... what do they have to actually do\nYou like I'm gonna I'm gonna spend X amount of dollars at this community college to to hire or to train a\nFour thousand students to prepare them for this line of work or I'm going to I'm I'm partnering with uh this state workforce agency to a at X number of apprenticeships in these areas and\nThat that's basically I mean they have to be an application process and all that um but if it's ... it's going to the ... the government getting the you know making the application getting the credits and making the investment after that willing to what you propose\nTwo billion dollars the taxpayers money one thing that would make me happier about it is a big and making relatively revenue neutral\nAnd I would address the college question you raised I Wish we forced to everybody wanted to apply for any kind of loan you know unless you if you want to go pay for college out of your mom and dad's bank you can go for it I don't care what you so you can study fighting ring up a provide yeah well and that's that's how most of us did and I did it that way and and you know I ... I didn't finish\nBut that's that's not what if you said to them if we\nAnd I did it that way and and you know I didn't I didn't finish but that's that's that but if you said to them\nIf we sit down with you and you say I Want to spend\nTwo hundred thousand dollars on a degree to get a job as a social worker paying forty two thousand or thirty two thousand dollars a year will say that it has in pencil we're not giving you a ... and we're not giving you know to go study something where you invest a gigantic amount of money and make a in somebody else's money that you're borrowing and then you'll expect somebody else paid off\nSo if you did it that way in and made it to pay for I think they caught on Capitol Hill where you say the money we saved by not spending it on people getting you know degrees in a you know left tended French literature or something that they don't have any practical application will pay for the kid who actually does want to learn how to weld\nLarger making way too much sets [laughter]\nBut I I I think that ship I I think that that was wrong that you can't put\nUm bombing which happened to press terrorists terrorists I'm afraid we're not originally from our country the immediately mediate lately and say oh it must be the Tea Party it was she put it this it was not us\nTime after time after time it's your time and I I resent it completely resent\nThe way that they're trying to say that the out I'll outrageous unlawful behavior that is leading to more and more violent we're seeing from the left just anything like the group of people who I had worked side by side with for nearly the last decade\nYou know I'm going to make a comparison and I think this is something we can work with\nI made it earlier tonight when I was talking to a friend of mine and I said uh you remember when David Duke was alleged to have endorsed Donald Trump it turned out he had not and Donald Trump disclaimer the connection but the media went you know crazy\nTrying to tell the president if some crazy man who's affiliated with the Klan endorses you you have to immediately come out and\nAnd I guess you're not recanted you've never accepted the endorsement and I'm sure there are people who maybe have unsavory attitudes based on race religion or otherwise you say I Love the Lars Larson Joe well\nI don't control what people think so somebody told me there's some big it who live somewhere in California that really love your show I'd say\nOkay I got nothing I can do about it he's entitled to think whatever crazy things he wants offensive though they may be this on my fault you know because I I didn't ask for his endorsement\nAnd and so the reason I'm bringing this up as the media extent it expended a huge amount of time and energy telling the president that if somebody unsavory endorses him that he would have to come out and condemn that endorsement and condemned the Klan\nOkay on that same basis\nI Would like to see people started showing up\nAt whatever public events democratic candidates and Democrat office holders are holding it I mean federal as well as local folks around America and say will you condemn the acts of violence by left wing extremists in this country\nAnd I'm willing to bet that most of the folks out there running for reelection all the members of the house and a third of the Senate\nOn the Democratic side will not want to do that they they will not want to condemn it and and the problem is right now the mainstream media is even bothering to ask the question and I think to some extent if you could get major office holders to condemn this kind of thing from the left\nThat it would have some effect because right now they're happy to just sit back and let these extremists go out set fire to things\nAnd and enjoy what they think is the benefit of it without having without having to be asked are you endorsing this is this something that you believe in and because of the mainstream media is in the position where they are the ones who should be asking them\nOn the the means to me there should be asking them but they're not they're not going to ask them because the people on the left\nOr the elected officials and the people here the left to its leaders are chanting them up and pouring fuel on the higher Eric Holder today when we when we ... that Michelle Obama was wrong it said when\nThey go low we go high no no he said no no when they go low we kick them yeah I Know it's like to be checked by Eric Holder and the IRS and that the Obama administration so yeah that's exactly\nExactly the kind of behavior I Would expect from our former attorney general Maxine Waters hauling for silence chasing down on supporters of the president wherever you can find them a gas station the grocery stores and apartments\nHauling for silence chasing down on supporters of the president wherever you can find them a gas station thing which is the department stores wherever you can't\nThe left took her up on that we see that time after time and now Hillary Clinton saying well it's on and we're not going to be civil to people who disagree with that because they're trying to do what we did politically yet there's a way to do things and you go and you make changes through the political system\nYou do it at an civil early on to people throughout the rest of the country who your fellow Americans unless you're trying to send a signal to them that you watch them to cause violence and I think that that may very well be with Hillary Clinton is okay but\nI think that's what she's doing ... making the threat we will continue to be an civil until you give us power back which is such an outrageous kind of challenge to say so you're going to continue to cause trouble in major American cities around the country until we give you power back\nShe wants to rule the mob she couldn't get power legitimately ... last rent rent she's she's a perennial loser in politics and now she's decided that the way she's going to win is through the rule the mob joining baths thanks so much for the time denied and thanks for what you do is founder of the Tea Party patriots\nThanks for having me\nDoes Germany both
