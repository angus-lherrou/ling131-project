beginning of their programs\nSarah Huckabee Sanders had a lot of questions ... from a very hostile White House press crowd that wanted to blame the president of the ...\nMany people and I thought we talked to a rabbi sparrow about that known worldwide as America's rabbi watches the middle east for us he's the president of the caucus for America and the author of pushback reclaiming our American Judeo Christian eat those rabbi star welcome back to the program\nThanks you Lars thank you\nHow do we properly respond to what's happened here and and I guess at the same time I'd ask you how do we respond when there's so many people in this country who seem I guess anxious to blame a Donald Trump the grandfather Jewish children the father of a Jewish daughter the\nYou know the father in law of a Jewish son in law and and yet they seem to want to blame him for what this Mad Men has done\nWell I think the country's been responding correct the statements are coming in calls are coming in I'm getting calls of the entire Jewish community or whoever is Jewish has received some type of color a comfort\nFrom people in the country so I think the countries responded correctly the people that have not other media and a left wing or political people who are blaming President Trump for somebody\nWe had nothing to do matter of fact the murderer was an anti Trump or you didn't like a Donald Trump or that Donald Trump over the years has been a tremendous a branch of the Jewish community I live in New York years ago now I remember\nThey had an Israel day parade going down Fifth Avenue right there by the plaza hotel and Donald Trump was grand marshal and he and his father over the years way way before he was politics\nUm he uh he had helped\nBy land or a synagogue or a building person that got it's been a tremendous tremendous amount of the Jewish people we know what he's been doing for Israel so this is spacious this is atrocious to up\nThey lay is slaughter a man who was so close to the Jewish people but this one they the left wing will do what ever\nThey\nWant to do in order to us and the president to win the mid term elections\nMe rabbi one of the things that frustrates me as an inter Hungary center spoke to this bed she said why don't you give this president credit for the things he has done including those things like moving the U.S embassy to Jerusalem and you would think\nThat a reasonable press corps might say the ... you know the president has a Jewish daughter and son in law and the Jewish grandchildren how does this hit him instead they they seem anxious to to an end with other presidents if there was a connection of some kind\nYou know to some things are in the in the world where they had a very personal connection that they wanted to know so how is this affecting the president was you know was he thinking instead a they're only aimed seems to be to say look let's see how we can lay the blame on him or for things that he said or done\nOne of the media wants him to fail\nAnd more so they want him to be demonizing defame so that he never has any of public on or even once she does leave the presidency but they wanted to save them because the media's as you know not you like most of the media\nWhat about Ninety to Ninety four percent of them are donate to to the Democratic causes they do their liberal ... some of them are big time left us and they're no longer honest brokers they're not journalists it's\nThey're not acting as if they were journalists who were supposed to sit back and be objective it become a propaganda and then Dr nation arm and they're an arm of liberalism in on the Democratic party and it's it's it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing here because without a affair pressed the American people are just\nI'm of liberalism in on the Democratic party and there's it's it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing here because without a affair pressed the American people are getting outside the ability to make proper decisions\nAnd dog and a rabbi sperm who's the author most recently of pushback reclaiming our American Judeo Christian either was\nThe other thing that came up and and I think they miss characterized the president's comments because he was asked by a reporter you know what what might have made a difference and and the reporter asked specifically about armed guards and the president said yes it'd be it would have made some different if if there had been somebody there with a with a firearm to respond to this attack\nThat took so many lives and they immediately cast\nThat is Donald Trump blamed the victim for being attacked but I Do wonder rabbi what do you think there are congregations aren't there that that actually do a note that they need to to defend themselves is that something you think more synagogues will start doing in response to a a threat like this\nI Hope so because one of the obligations that we have is people who are community to our family is self defense we have to defend protect people who are in\nOur responsibility and um I think it's a good thing if they would have a couple of people in the synagogue beyond whatever type of professional security they have at the entrances\nBut it will be good in churches and synagogues or a couple of people in ... list that no one knows\nThey have some type of concealed weapon people that are trained to this they have a license to carry a this is the times that we live in and thank God we have a Second Amendment the founders believed in this the purpose of having guns was not just necessarily go hunting for Turkish and deer but it was to protect\nIn a situation like this for example eleven people were killed in some more were wounded if there had been someone there was a a a concealed weapon as soon as this started maybe two or three people would have been killed with that person could have just\nNot the assailant the murderer the slaughter right there and saved so many lives but the left doesn't want to hear this because they want the solution to be that nobody should have an eight guns\nWhile you're criminals awful always going to have guns\nSo there shouldn't be people I Know some of the guys that have um men in the Senate guys that that they have concealed weapons they've got permission from the local police department at the train it's very important that self defense what can be more important than self defense\nNo kidding ... but had the lessons of the Warsaw Ghetto been forgotten already by the community\nBy the Jewish community yes\nIt's in our our our difficulty is that we we have a very liberal Jewish community I Would say about Seventy percent of the Jewish community as liberal and they're no longer learning the lessons of history they are a mash from from from head to toe\nAnd all this utopian liberalism a hocus pocus or they think that the messiah that they think that's the lesson of history how quickly forget right the people but remember the lessons of history will be safer\nBut that's a a difficulty listen I think even some of the liberal churches would have this it made a a this gun control issue it made it got out of it and uh so foolish it's we're so lucky in this country that we have the right to defend ourselves\nThis the police come they do a good job but they take some Fifteen twenty minutes in the meantime a lot of people can be killed in that amount of time to many though it's good to have some type of a dark shooter there who knows what to do\nThat that there's nothing more important in the Bible in self defense because that that's what it means to be a responsible individual personal responsibility is to establish the people that you have really chosen\nIt'd be responsible for your wife or children\nIndividual personal responsibility is to just do the people you love really chosen to be responsible for your wife your children your family your church synagogue ... that's a that's noble that somebody just adjusted\nWell you know right by I had the question so many times over the years I've actually sat down to researched it years ago and and wrote a whole piece of Jesus Christ himself believed in the right of self defense and encouraged his disciples to do that or to say you have to have the ability to defend yourself and then he didn't just mean metaphorically the way I read history\nAnd I think that a modern American should think the same way as you say with all due respect to the police and I love the cops when seconds count the police are only minutes away\nAnd I'm just you just know that my audience and my family are are thinking uh you know we're we're we're saying our prayers and or or spring a thought for all those people who are who were hurt and killed and their family members\nI scares me can I get Lars Larson\nWe'd be calling politicians all day long on on those kinds of things\nUh excuse me can I get Lars Larson on the line 'cause Lars Larson iron amount of our lives lost and going off on block Obama if you like your doctor you can remember that ... ... oh my dad Lars Larson went ballistic went nuts I went nuts you know you can\nThen that kind of what you said was false it and I said you know what I understand that he made a mistake but you're right Lars if that's not true it's not true okay why did why would you have a different standard for this president then the last president when this president does it all the time\nYou know one I have lots of friends who tell me that their business is the biggest or the best of the longest then I might think well if I really want to debate with you I could probably be chew on the fact but I also understand that some of that is just talk\nBut what he's actually getting done for the country do you think the mainstream press which I think you like a whole lot more than I Do like the ... and the New York times and\nAnd uh ... the chicken noodle news network and and MSNBC\nThey won't give the guy credit for anything he got done will do\nAnything I boy I don't know I think what we have reports I mean obviously there's been some turbulence\nIn the uh financial markets of late but are there are people who are quick to give him credit and uh you know here at Fox News I think we look for opportunities\nTo properly deservedly give him credit when credit is due and of course Fox is the biggest cable channel I think the wall Street Journal the biggest newspaper gives him credit where credit's due\nYou notice how the the papers that actually tell to the right to do a whole lot better than the ones that go to the left was that tell you about the audience\nI don't know I mean I think the wall Street Journal it's been pretty successful for a little bit of time\nAnd that's what I mean but but I mean Fox has been very successful in the Trump era a and you would think if if we're told that people hate Donald Trump with a passion that Americans didn't want him that they reject him and that's where we're told is all the whole country hates the guy\nAnd and then the minute his approval ratings get actually better than Obama's word the same point in his presidency they stop reporting on the approval ratings and say oh we don't all\n... you know you're feeding agreements that fact is that when you look at Republican support for Donald Trump it's still in the eighties that's unbelievable it is for almost universal\nHave you looked at black support since you are black ... black support for President Trump eight percent of the vote in twenty sixteen twenty three percent support by the middle of last year thirty six percent as we stand here today by the time we get to twenty twenty\nTrump on this on that on that trajectory from may get to the point where he is half of of black Americans supporting him now what are they had a friend who's a\nAll those are such a weak pose with small sample size is that it's ridiculous but go right ahead so\nYou haven't heard about the blacks it\nOh yeah that sort of Kanye West and others fraud\nBut it's not just Kanye West because if ... Kanye West can say anything he wants to but of black Americans weren't embracing it the numbers wouldn't be changing in that direction or would they\nKnow I think I think black Americans not embracing so let me just tell you but I think that anybody who's the incumbent and who has the pope it it's going to have some impact but you're talking about starting at a point so low that increases are going to\nEspecially when you have a small sample size than a poll is going to jump up and down but boy I wouldn't bet on that one and in fact going into this mid term elections the big issue is not ...\nJump up and down but boy I wouldn't bet on that one and in fact going into this mid term election the big issue is not minority groups it's white women Lars especially educated white suburban women and are given Trump's history Stormy Daniels and\nThings like the healthcare problems that we haven't solved and immigration issues we haven't solved they're the ones\nThat react so strongly to the bombings the shooting over the weekend there she\nLives are you going to side than on writing or are you going to say the bombing is Trump's folders well\nNo I didn't say it was his he's not directly responsible he didn't pull the trigger he didn't tell the guy to do go do it but I think the rancor\nThe kind of you know one of the joys of our time together on the radio is I feel like we're having an honest discussion we aren't lip different points of view and but I think that there are lots of times when Donald Trump\nDemonize as any political opponent as not patriotic a bad person a criminal I I just don't understand why you ...\nYou mean rancor like saying you won't get civility back till you put our party back in power\nThat's not what she said she said you can't be

U. P. H. dot com [noise]\nWelcome\nBack to the Lars Larson show the it's a pleasure to be with you on a Monday evening and we\nAre one week away tomorrow from the election that will decide what happens in the midterms typically in midterm elections the party that is in the White House loses seats and the party not in the White House gains\nI thought to talk about that with Dr David Byrne who's an adjunct professor of history at California Baptist University in Santa Monica college and the author of the new book Ronald Reagan and intellectual biography Dr burn welcome back to the program\nThanks for having me Lars\nSo let's talk about this a Ronald Reagan did not do well after his first two terms in office city\nThat is correct you know he lost twenty six house seats and it looks like Trump may be poised to lose something similar but as you noted it's common for the president but party in power to lose seats um you know the the first election but as you also know Reagan was able to recover and he was able to land\nA massive reelection but yeah he lost twenty six house seats is his first term elections\nBy the way ... Donald Trump at this point is showing approval ratings that are in the forties where it was Ronald Reagan at about ... ... ...\nRoughly the exact same place Lawrence yeah his approval ratings um towards the end of a second term or high thirties low forties but gradually as the American economy approved and the third or fourth year of his presidency his approval rating lock it up or to propel it in ... reelected in Nineteen eighty four but the first two years in his\nPresidency his approval ratings are roughly right with Donald Trump's are\nBecause you point out in your writing that when Reagan left office in Nineteen eighty nine there were still people in his own party who didn't like him there were lots of Democrats who didn't like him I Know that there are lots of Democrats today who weren't even alive when Ronald Reagan was president who don't like Ronald Reagan a lot of that it's based on mythology\nBut people have to remember that if anyone thinks you're going to have a president with approval ratings in the sixties or seventies is not likely to happen Reagan had an average of ... ...\nGets into the forties now and the economy continues to do well he might hit twenty twenty with some very nice approval ratings from Americans about how well he's doing the job\nI think that's definitely true especially if the American economy is taste on it will be able to do on a plane that right and it's actually a lower today that was a time during the Reagan Era I said I'm climate ... today\nUm is probably you know she lets us five during the Reagan Era so yeah I think is the economy continues to grow and expand and as as long as I don't find it stays though I think Trump or probably maybe beginning towards the end of his third year maybe even the middle of next year he will begin to see his approval ratings rise too much like Reagan's\nDead so even with the crunch down by the fed which has raised rates now three times\nOr it looks like we could actually finish out the fourth quarter of this year or getting close to four percent GDP now I think I think the Trump would be doing a lot better if he got the kind of favorable coverage that\nA a bronco Obama God for producing a lackluster economy the media seemed to be an slobbering love affair with Obama and they seem to hate Trump with a passion\nIf they were to to do stories that pointed out how much things have changed and how good things are right now economically speaking for Americans Trump might have an even higher approval rating\nThe fact that he has an approval rating in the forties when the media keeps telling Americans no matter what's going on around you the guy's a terrible guy\nBut I I agree lawyers and you know one of the things I discuss with bottles vacant and intellectual biography does that compare that GDP Growth with Reagan Obama\nFor Reagan GDP Growth in eight years of president average about four percent which is very strong so it was nearly two percent for Trump's right now it's it's been about three percent and the second year but yeah you know I I think your life is the lead it certainly I was in the ...\nWith with the plight that that that made it much harsher on Trump than it has been Obama which you know and they completely stay are considering a GDP Growth is certainly a bit stronger under Trump than Obama but of course if\nIt has it been yet styles that was under Reagan I Know that they're all like it was nearly four percent\nHas an ... and I guess some of this is about times do change and I know that when when Reagan was showing these great growth numbers for the economy I didn't hear I hadn't\nHeard any economist saying it'll be impossible for us to reach those and the other piece that I think is not being mentioned in you tell me what you make of it\nIs that if reporters were honest and said heading up to the twenty sixteen election when Donald Trump was saying we can grow it three or four even five percent\nAnd all of them said no no no no the smartest people in economic say America has a new normal that different than the Nineteen eighties and that we can never get really much more than a tenth or a two tenths of a point above two percent\nAnd Trump is already producing that number if that contrast was being drawn by reporters and believe me doctor I say this because\nAs a reporter myself for Twenty years\nWe always I mean that was a big part of the job of being reporter is you didn't just say well the number is to this today\nA ... because people would routinely want to know well what does that number means you say well it was half of that a year ago and it might be twice that a year from now\nThen that gave them some contacts for understanding what a particular number means whether you're talking about unemployment rates are\nAverage household income or any number if you said gee we got a lot of rain this year well how much do we get well we've got twenty percent more than last year and then then that gives people a context or understanding oh we did get a lot twenty percent more than last year\nBut I have yet to see a single mainstream reporter maybe I've missed it but\nOh we did get a lot twenty percent more than last year but I have yet to see a single mainstream reporter maybe I missed it but I read a lot of different news sources from both the left and the right I've yet to see anybody in the mainstream say\nAll the smartest economists said that economic performance above about two percent was simply impossible including the likes of Paul Krugman and Donald Trump is already eclipse that number handling\nHere exactly right laws you know the same thing happened in the late seventies early eighties right before in the early ... let's say you know the economists are saying well you know several eight percent unemployment at ... percent GDP Growth that's just the new normal but Reagan was inherently optimistic and in the thing is that America is better than that\nAnd you know like you said it it just because the price so the economists say well\nYou know the the GDP Growth is going to continue to be cheaper said uh you know it doesn't mean it has to be that way as an optimist below that America to do better than that and I think you're right and ready immediate cheer should be a little more optimistic and do a little better job of showing how you know the American economy has done better and can you can continue to do better\nDoctor burn is the author most recently Ronald Reagan intellectual biography be foreign ramp up tonight with you I Want to know\nI Know that this makes it certainly makes the leapt cringe when I say this but it also makes even some of my conservative friends cringe when I say are their favorable comparisons to be made between Ronald Reagan president Ronald Reagan and president Donald Trump\n[noise] sure there are favorable comparisons of for example both raking in South believe and heavy to spend defense spending most of them believe that\nThat you know a strong America's better America a Reagan of course along with them you know the ever lower taxes both for for all classes really raking of course cut taxes\nOr every class so I'm basically did the same thing so they're definitely you know by comparison to the similarities between at your prize at the other differences too but yeah there there are similarities they certainly are opposite\nKnown in fact I've I've seen that as well and while obviously does the communication style of the two men is very different they both are very good communicators\nOh absolutely they both are that ... thing their message um I Would contend Reagan message was always a little more optimistic and Trump\nIs a little more clearly and pessimistic but despite that I read it they're definitely a great uh can convey a message is I was just can contend that what they convey as little difference I Would really hope is lost his or or at least the next year is is president the trunk\nBecomes a little optimistic and thoughtless Reagan late and they ... you know the classic argument that Reagan made with it It's MORNING in America at that our best days are before us and I hope that trust at least begin to emulate Reagan a little bit more ... and his optimism\nSee I I supported both the demand is president I voted for both of the man but I agree with you you have Donald Trump were to say look we fixed many of the problems but we have so much more potential and if he were to\nTo get it all the way from white lab coats you know doing experiments with bickers all the way to appeal you can get from your pharmacy and take is about two billion dollars if you can't get that two billion back\nVery few people I think are going to be willing to say well let's throw a lot of money into that will come up with a wonder drug and then everybody will insist on getting it for fifty cents a bill that that doesn't work nobody wants to do that and nobody will do that\nSo when we stopped doing it who's going to develop the new drugs to treat ailments you know that that aren't treatable right now\nNo one yeah absolutely nobody will and and that it's a big part of the problem look there's all sorts of ways to address to the price controls overseas in terms of intellectual property right or\nYou know in ... with the countries and that's something that because we know we should be pursuing to to make sure the country's respect our intellectual property rights and that's it\nI think a smart way to proceed but price controls is going to do exactly what you said we've had some great innovations in terms of cancer in terms of hepatitis C cures to diseases that didn't exist before\nAnd we did a lot more to do and if we if we step on price controls we're not going to get there\nAnd see that's the concern I've got dark because I'm I'm pushing sixty at this point I have to take a couple of medicines but I think they've been out of copyright owner pat and for a long long time so they're dirt cheap even ... if you have to pay for him out of your own pocket\nBut I worry that we're we're we're gonna have all these companies say I'm not going to go out and spend a lot of money to come up with a new drug if I can get the money it seems like the uh get the money back for what the cost of developing was and making it profitable and frankly for all the people curse the pharma companies I don't ...\nThey want a Fifteen Percent return it's a high risk activity if they took the same money and put it\nFor all the people curse the pharma companies I don't ...\nThey want a Fifteen Percent return it's a high risk activity if they took the same money and put them plowed into a restaurant they'd get eight percent return in other investments they'd get other returns but you want a slightly higher return\nBecause you're doing a more risky activity that brings lawsuits and you know terrible stories in the news you make a bad drug and you don't know it's bad to lose out and you know a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand people a ... there are all kinds of risks for risk there ought to be reward so\nIs it I'm I'm just wondering why when the president's focus so much on trade and intellectual property up till now why he doesn't say we're not going to put price controls on we're just going to Canada in China and Russia and Western Europe you've got to pay\nSomething closer to the real cost of these drugs and if you rip us off\nWe have ways to punish you through lack of access to American markets wouldn't something like that also the ... in other words if the pill really takes twelve bucks a pill to recoup the cost\nAnd Americans are now paying fourteen dollars a pill and Europeans are paying four dollars a pill or because because they're ripping or candidate is part of being four dollars a pill\nWhy do we tell Canada they gotta pay the same price we do and Europe has to pay the same price but the overall price will drop from fourteen down to nine Europe will pay more will pay a little less the drug gets paid for\nDoes not seem like a more sensible way to go at it\nBoth certainly is a few restrictions we have anything to better off kind of globally things would be so\nThings are always complicated they don't always work out you know ... we would like it or as you were describing but\nI I I think to diminish spied on in terms of what we're having trade negotiations and we want we need our intellectual property rights are respected and that's something that you know if it's important to achieve in pharmaceutical isn't it's important in many other kind of industry is well that's something\nThat ... we want to engage more with the world\nAnd in doing until we need to make sure they do all the intellectual property rights are respected in the other point that you made which I think is also\nReally important to emphasize is if you're investing your money for your retirement or your kid's college or whatever you're saving for vacation new boat\n... you're not going to put that in a company that's going to lose money no play in a company we can't get that risk or trade off if you think about it is your own investment where are you going to put the money and if somebody said hey look we're going to slap on price controls\nOn some of the most innovative drugs and you can't recoup costs\nWill you invest in that company I think most people would say no and I think that on the humanize is exactly what kind of capital market process it's occurring why would you invest in a company\nThat can't get you that kind of competitive which can make your own personal financial goals\nAnd Dr the only thing I Wish I Wish the former companies were out there more instead of talking to Congress talking to the American public\nBecause almost every other industry that faces these kinds of problems with governments and mark is comes out and makes its cage to the American public and I think the former industries for some strange reason is being very very quiet about all this and that makes me wonder why aren't you making the case we\nNeed the money and if we have to get it from you will get it from

Fifteen\nHundred years ago this week as he writes the first raised with Don were poking through the trees\nMirror US military cemetery in France as lieutenant Arthur do we know in the ... earth beside one of the hundreds of crosses in that field Patrick welcome back to the program and would you like to tell the rest of that story for me please\n... ... it's great to be back with ours\nAnd what we're talking about is the anniversary of the selection of the unknown soldier and this is America's unknown soldiers\nThere are several on those soldiers in the actual tune as a soldier wants to but there's the first soldier of the first unknown soldier which the world war one soldier there is a World War two soldier there's then there's the Korean War soldier and what we're talking about is the original one down soldier and\nIt's really a a solemn and in a court and storied American history\nThat I tell in the book the unknowns whichever way out and\nIt's it's really a remarkable story we did not have a ... with the conclusion of World War one we did not have it on a soldier for several years the um you know\nThe war department felt that they could identify the twenty seven hundred Americans that were listed as on now and they were in many of them had been badly ... mutilated by heavy artillery shells et cetera they were missing in action\nIt was hard to tell who is who is still unknown but they still felt that they could do it and um there was the thought that the that all of our soldiers could be identified and that really did but it wasn't happening\nAnd what what occurred though is the great powers like France and England\nBoth decided to designate a special to for those who are considered a no it it really represented\nAll of those who had fought in the great war it was a sense of of ... giving a sense of closure to the war\nAnd what happened is in the United states there was a movement that that was created interestingly enough it was a a a woman editor for a very popular women's magazine those delineate or who sort of\nYou know put out this thing that we needed to have our own uh no soldier and she created a movement the press got behind it and then the war department finally got behind it in a a very influential congressman from New York I'm ... congressman Hamilton Fish who was a\nHe was an officer in what was known as the Harlem health ... this was a um an as segregated unit in during World War one\nUm and he was a white officer in this unit they distinguish themselves in combat it fish really got behind the idea of an unknown soldier gets it through Congress in Wilson signs it\nAnd then basically you know the anniversary last week where\nWent the greatest registration units went to the four great cemeteries and France where the major battles were fought this is bell or the use our guy on sand ... even the summer with fought with the British\nThey were moved for unknown soldiers from the cemeteries they carefully checked the bodies make sure that there were no dog tags or identification papers they wanted to make sure that these were really unknown soldiers from America they've and brought them back\nTo show loans France where there was a ceremony and\nThe French population turned out for this there were many many um those in the population that have lost their sons to war and they really felt a connection to America they'll love for America for what we had done to help basically say France during World War one\nAnd there was an honor guard made up of of the ... you know the grants and the French Army that had really saw an action n word highly decorated and\nOf of the ... you know the grants and the French Army that at really saw an action n word highly decorated and\nThe plan was for the for an American general to select a soldier and\nHigh ranking official at the time it was as Andrea ... who is a tension he was the best or pensions and other friendship Fishell says hey look we used an enlisted man to select are on a soldier and literally that night\nA an enlisted man was selected who was one of the polar bears of this a procession and his name was Edward younger surgeon Edward Geiger who is with the nineteenth century regiment and this is the second evasion I get into this\nIf you were younger story in great detail the and then I was because he was in most of the major ... he was looted several times and that was really his distinguishing mark\n... he would he had effectively what was known as a wolf shepherd what was the precursor to the Purple Heart and he had two of them and\nYounger was selected that night uh spontaneously because he had the best record of the other men in the group and um he was given that morning a collage of white roses\nAnd the inside of the the city hall she loans had four flag draped casket\nIn younger as words were it was absolutely sublime as he saw the flag over these caskets the floor was lined with with rose petals and he walked in but he realized the gravity of the situation he couldn't decide and um he\nCan't taste around nervously and then said a prayer and he said that the second casket to his rights he felt this motion in his hand he just stood there frozen\nIn his hand literally move without him moving it you felt like he felt like that he had known to man and the casket somehow that man because maybe somebody that had died next to him maybe even took taken a bullet for him and he placed the flowers on the casket in that as America's unknown soldier\nIs amazing the ... you know it really is amazing and one of the things you mentioned a moment ago that the war department even a hundred years ago if we're we're confident that they could actually determine who all these service members were\nAnd and you can imagine how much easier would be today to identify the remains of a service member or even a civilian uh who might have been killed you know and and yet they thought they could do it back then and and by today's standards of what they had to work with was was not much but they\nThey they clearly were intend on trying to make sure we identify every one of our\nOf our last ah members of the service and uh but it was it was smart it surprises me that out of the civil war there was no\nUnknown tomb of the unknowns I'm going going back into the Eighteen hundreds\nNo there wasn't and then the thing is that through American history there are large numbers of unknown graves or even at Arlington there is a mass grave of union soldiers that are that are considered unknowns and now you know that still exist there's there's ... there's multiple areas where there's unknown soldiers\n... Rao or is there any effort going on today to try to go back and identify those service members were are simply too many years gone by\n... you know I I don't know if anybody's actually thought about it ... you know and another example I can give you is the ship 'em memorial that's in Brooklyn in their ... their in lies literally upwards of over ten thousand bodies of American service members\nIn Brooklyn in their ... their lives literally upwards of over ten thousand bodies with American service members from the revolutionary war and these men were imprisoned on on British ships concentrations shit\nChips basically and their bodies were just filled overboard after they died lead them die because the the the ships were you know\nFilled with disease they were starve to death on these a prison hawks and their bodies are just thrown overboard in those were literally washing your short\nOf decades after the revolutionary war and there\nThan they were just gathered and gathered up into a pile of skills and Bones Are placed in this memorial a which is in in uh near green parked in in Brooklyn so there's literally\nPotentially you know thousands of Revolutionary War sort soldiers that are buried there that are unknown as well ... you know interesting ... on a analysis\nBut you would think knowing that that's a country that knows it has to protect itself and even on the very very ...\nAnd banks and things like that but you would think knowing that that's a country that knows it has to protect itself and even on the very very grassroots level\nThat you would think it would make perfect sense to say we we need to have some some way to repel an attack like this the police will be there quickly but not nearly quickly enough\nTo stop this kind of of of murder and and there were in fact for police officers who were wounded as well and so\nYou know this this is something that and yet in that very city in Pittsburgh last week the school board voted not to allow police officers to carry guns at schools and then a couple of days later this happens I Wonder how the vote might have gone had the vote been taken this week instead of last week\nWell it probably won't be changed sadly that you know we see this over and over and over again I've had clients who were told they couldn't bring their children to daycare to drop them off in the morning on their way to work in uniform\nBecause they were carrying a firearm you know and people have said well we don't need firearms we don't need people to to be able to react to it we just have metal detectors well first of all metal detectors at a house of worship basically would be running\nThe individuals who support the congregation through the metal detectors and if somebody shows up to the metal detectors and start shooting\nYou still are started stabbing people are dropping an id you still have to have someone to protect them and someone to respond to that threat and you know it's really interesting and due to a you mentioned the law enforcement response an excellent law enforcement response the United states about four to six minutes yup and due to an incredible military\nAnd an incredible law enforcement force throughout the United states\nWe have lived in relative comfort with soft targets being exposed other countries recognize that these target need on the security and you know I listened to the mayor of Pittsburgh comments and he said he does not want to live in a world where we have to have on security outside of a church\nWell no one does but that's the world\nWe will and wouldn't you imagine I haven't checked but I'd be willing to bet you ten dollars lands that the mayor of Pittsburgh has armed security with him do would you imagine that there's armed security\nAt the mayor's office there is in almost any medium to large size city in America there's armed security with public officials had to go to a ball game at a stadium at a university there is routinely armed security not may take the form of state police were assigned to that event but they understand\nLarge gatherings of people are are often the target of Mad Men like this Robert Ballard\nWell it would not surprise me if the mayor of Pittsburgh it's a large enough city and I visited it's great city I wouldn't surprise me if there is on security but what you know people don't even realize at conferences that law enforcement conferences we'd had armed security outside of the doors before\nAnd and even though law enforcement tends to be a harder target\nThere's a vulnerability there where people are not focused on their own safety\nSo how do we fix this problem I mean because if we have institutions like those who say and I'm not for forcing it on them but how do we how do we stop this problem if the people who are perhaps the most attractive targets to nuts like Robert Bowers will not protect themselves\nWell the first thing is be realistic\nAnd stop living in a dream world you can't say to yourself well we don't want bad things to happen here and therefore they won't happen\nBut that's just not realistic in addition you know my ... has been retain several times to help design security programs are trained people inside of houses of worship because there's a recognition that there is it different\nTo help design security programs are trained people inside of houses of worship because there's a recognition that there is a different risk for a little church\nThan there is for a church in the downtown area with a lot of exposure where the congregation meeting times are published all built big billboard out and fun and they're realistic nature of the assessment um has to be done and to deny it really is not only to deny the truth but it's to put people at risk as we've said\nWell and I think about the fact that most houses of worship in the United states are open some of them are open twenty four hours a day which is great and it fits right in with the message the most religious denominations believe in but if you're going to be open twenty four hours a day if you're going to have a door that is open to all\nThen I think you have a duty to protect the people there and that's not to blame the people who lost their lives on Saturday\nIs to say I wish we could have made sure that they were still alive today Lance thanks for what you're doing all mentioning because usually do but when cops killing blue news the books are by ... Russo the profits from them go to benefit law enforcement officers and their families who've lost their lives Lance thanks so much for the time\nThey surely you about coming up in a moment a lot of talk about the fact that the president has described some in the media who generate fake news now remember that's an important distinction those in the media who ... generate fake news and give\nYou bad information or the enemy of the people I think that's true but I'll talk to him ... who gives me a run for my money coming up next in just a moment on Mars Mars [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis story is called the ugly truth about timeshare if you think you've done your family fiber about buying a timeshare you need my help\nHello I'm shot McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial ...\nTen years ago I started helping folks canceled their timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called\nThe Tom sure cancellation industry Tom shares the only thing that you can buy that you can't show me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end when you buy time share you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they want for annual\nMaintenance and assessment phase sound crazy the crazy thing is there's never ends even when you die your family\nIs now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to stay calm office now I guarantee if we can't answer your time to contract you'll pay nothing\nCall for your free information kid eight hundred Seventy six Ninety three hundred eight hundred Seventy six Ninety three hundred eight hundred and Seventy six Ninety three hundred\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners are less sees can receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective take on it airbags in their vehicles\nTo see if you're a vehicle is included and to file a claim go to auto airbags settlement dot com or call one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your ...\nYou from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates days locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRitual approval only about on certain through your ... conditions equal housing Leonard licensing all the states and I'm like thirty thirty visual conditions are solutions may play\nOne over one cake UGA just two sons mid term election destination station and we want you to know about proposition is coming up on the November ballot\nProposition for sixty three is positioned as Pima County solution to road condition was the county would split four hundred thirty million dollars in a fair and equitable way amongst the area's jurisdictions moron proposition for sixty three add another good one oh four one K. cutie H. dot com\nAt the top and bottom of the hour said connected uninformed anytime at one of four one K. cutie H. dot com Wildcats\nWelcome the Colorado Buffalo's to the U.S stadium this Friday listen to the Joe ... show forty seven for your chance to win for packing tickets to the gang\nCrossroads less gun show returns from the Pima County fairgrounds this weekend listen to the Joe ... four to seven your chance to win a pair of tickets joining one for one kick you G H in the Tucson metropolitan chamber of commerce in military Affairs Committee ... containers Britain other operations ooh that's right we're packing just not socks are sweaters fun gifts that a soldier would want like sports\nBalls card games and hatch brings some joy to Tucson based soldiers who are serving overseas and can't be with their families over the holidays drop off your brand new or fairly new gift in March container at mama's famous speech on speedway less a swan before November Eighteen to more information and gift ideas are at one of four one K.
