dot com when I was a kid\nMy fondest desire was to own a radio controlled plane and when I saw a radio controlled helicopters that would be fantastic now when I was a kid I never had the money to afford something like that\nI can afford it but I don't I don't have the time for that kind of thing but I'm fascinated with what drones and the problem is they hold\nFor being able to improve all kinds of things when used by various folks within our society and I've seen them used by farmers to make sure that their crop yields are up and it's amazing how that works I've seen them used in some cases by law enforcement the problem is\nWe may also sees amused by criminals while I've invited Jason ... who's a policy analyst at the Edwin Meese Center for legal in judicial studies that heritage\nJason good to have you back on the program\nMakes your happening so do the police need the ability to be able to either shoot down or bring down drones if they end up being used not just by terrorists but by ordinary criminals as well\nBut the uh the answer that question is absolutely yes uh you know we're on the cusp of really I think a revolution\nAnd what Germans are going to be able to do in terms of productive and positive things for society we're talking about engaging in life saving activities that can bring a emergency medical equipment to the scene of an accident ... minutes or helping to find someone who was lost in a community\nLeader uses the drones are being at the two right now and I think we're going to see a lot of that but we also see that uh you know as with any new technology there's also a potential for misuse and abuse and there have certainly been a fair number of cases in just the last few months\nWhere drones are being put to a novel criminal or or even terrorists purposes and law enforcement uh unfortunately does not have presently the ability to do much if anything to stop the\nJews and before we go to the ability to bring him down can you give us a couple of examples about crooks have been using them\nShore so really what we're seeing\nIs that criminals are at least innovative when it comes to to finding new uses for drugs as ... or as innovators of the commercial side uh we've we've looked at some of the instances at a at heritage when we were doing research on this and I was quite frankly floored by by how ... be used we've seen cases where\nA a you know common burglars are using drones to uh to case houses before they break and we've seen instances where drones are being used essentially to serve as\nA if you will a criminal Airforce actually surveilling the law enforcement personnel who are attempting to a Surveillance Act against organized crime\nOr and then of course it it just last couple of months we've seen how drones can be used it in a terrorist attack or when you look at the Venezuela instance a incident excuse me\nA where allegedly there was an assassination attempt on the president of Venezuela and it was too drones armed with explosives that we're going to be the instruments for that fascination of taps so really it runs it runs\nPeople are flying a NATO gently or recklessly and there are a number of instances where drones have been observed in the flight lines at airports and in fact you can go on YouTube and see a really impressive but clearly dangerous videos of drones just a few feet above a man jetliner coming in for a landing\nI'm trying to remember I thought I heard about but maybe it was just one those somebody imagining what they could be used for but you know that getting contraband inside of prisons has been a big business it literally\nSend them out to millions of dollars whether it's drugs or weapons with those kinds of things and I'm Wondering whether a people that have have tried to use that I Can't remember a specific example where that's been done but I Would love to give the authorities the ability to bring drones like that down if they see one flying over in dropping contraband inside the walls\nYou're right that's a very real problem and in fact there there are some specific examples that comes to mind where justice thing as has happened\nIn a correctional facility in Ohio for example a a drone was used to smuggle contraband into the prison there apparently it was a accidently drop in the wrong location it wound up in the hands of the wrong a prison gang within the prison walls\nAnd sparked a Seventy five in may ball or in another instance a prisoner was able to use tools that appear to have been smuggled in by drone to escape in a maximum security prison\nOr and then at the southern border or not not a prison context but we see what our would have been dubbed narco drugs that are being used to ferry drugs are from Mexico into the United states\nOver the head of a border patrol agents who are just unfortunately powerless to do much beyond tracking those drones to actually you know interdict though\nSo in case like that should we have ... if we don't already have from the military the ability to electronically knock these things out of the year should we allow law enforcement the latitude to shoot them out of the year if necessary\nYes what we're talking about now is how to empower law enforcement agencies to engage in what's known as countered drone uh operations and counter drone operations there they they run the gamut from a you know merely using what's known as an unmanned traffic management system central air traffic control for drones\nTo restrict access to particular areas I'm ... so that drunk and not fly into the airspace above say the super bowl or near an airport all the way to kinetic devices like or even just a plain old firearm\nTo shoot down of drone there are a lot of open questions about exactly what the order of operations will be if you will in terms of identifying drones that are posing a threat to public safety\nWarning the operator and then what sort of tools or techniques will be able to properly engage those because as you might imagine\nIf you're dealing with a a true terrorist and spent the last thing I think he would want to do is shoot down a drone which might be carrying an explosive device because then of course you create a hazard to the people on the ground\nI but what we have right now is federal legislation that has just been sent to the White House the FAA reauthorization that will for the first time and power federal law enforcement to engage in counter John activities which today have been barred\nWow and is one of the big problems with the fact that these things are largely made a plastic they're not made out of ... models which means that it's going to be tough to spot them unless you can spot them visually and since they're small they're not easy to spot visually from from any kind of distance\nThat's one of the problems or is it actually being able to detect a drone at any reasonable distance because even though these fly at a considerably slower speed typically than manned aircraft are\nThey still fly pretty fast and so you have to be able to ideas and several miles away from a potential target said that you can have any reasonable amount of time to be able to do the threat assessment to identify\nThat she is and so that is certainly one of the challenges that being said\nUh you know in the ... the the mother of invention and there are a fair number of private sector companies right now\nThat are developing and bringing to market exactly these sorts of technology and we are we looking at optical cameras were looking at a at radar and you know other people are looking actually at a a audio equipment they can actually detect the buzzing south of drugs\nAnd then you have to be able to identify what kinds of drone trace the signals to the extent that it's not an automated drawn so that you identify individual user\nIsrael challenges that will need to be a that would need to be dealt with salt future\nYou know Jason a few uh about Thirty years ago it was on board a a coast guard airplane were just shooting a story for television about how they did search and rescue and they got a call up to trace the guy they thought was running drugs it turns out he was and he was in a twin engine aircraft which is a pretty good size aircraft and they gave chase\nAnd the guy knew they were chasing them and we were in a jet a slower speed jet but at the jet all the same of falcon and this guy kept dropping down below us and then would try to turn the other direction and I asked the pilots afterwards I said at what point do you lose sight of this guy if he manages to go east when we're going west before we can turn around\nHe said about four miles out it's really hard to see him and that's a full sized aircraft\nOr take it down from full size to the size of a drone one big enough to carry ... let's say a couple of pounds of explosive\nAnd all of a sudden your your ability to see them at any distance may go from four miles to you know half a mile for tens of a mile because it it was amazing to me that we look and say I know the guys out there but try to spot him in the sky from another aircraft was very very difficult Jason thanks for the work to do it heritage and\nThat we've taken to calling regulatory dark matter that pours out it's not supposed to be binding however if you disobey it you may not get your permit you may not get your waiver so there's a lot of bureaucratic pressure that come there\nWhat we recommended that the Trump do an executive order kind of like Reagan's executive order\nThat requires the cost benefit analysis that we have now for normal rules but the Trump address these guidance documents 'cause\nHe's pretty much pick the low hanging fruit as far as the two for one regulations right you would imagine that you know he's looked at it you know there's a congressional Review Act got rid of Obama's midnight roles that then he's done some two for one\nOf ... of all the uh the rules that are out there but you kind of kind of run run to the end of that for the next thing you should do I think his address guy that said there's been a lot of significant guy that's the bathroom ... guide and\nI was going to I was going to bring them or not yeah when I was like my audience Angela in fact that you know the rule that said the bathrooms in both colleges in public schools had\nTo be open so that a a biological boy who now claims he's a girl can use the ladies' room and and that's that was deeply disturbing for a lot of people they said that any ride\nAnd yet it didn't come out of even a regulation that came out of a guy you know God it\nWas just quickly the interesting thing on that laws as he got rid of that but he didn't count it didn't credit himself into two for one also the department of labor got rid of a role in front of a guidance on franchising but Obama had didn't count credit himself for that\nThey got rid of rule on independent contracting that was going to cause additional regulatory burdens for up for independent contractors\nDidn't count that in favor in its two for one cross it\nThere's other guy that you mentioned the FCC that you know there will be tremendous guidance coming out of the net neutrality rules that's being rolled back now you also guidance to me is a sense they can sense the beer bureaucracy can regulate now without writing anything down I think it's important that Trump\nUse if he could create an executive order the same kind of legacy and sticky power that Reagan's executive order on cost benefit analysis\nHas for guidance documents and I think after the pen and tone era that's an important thing to do especially if we you know\nWe're going to have new elections were going to have democratic presidents again we need to have something in place that discloses makes transparent transparent and tries to make an effort to roll back the abuse of guidance documents or regular\nWayne let me do a deep dive just a little bit I mean into the wee bit\nAnd here's one I Want to know I can understand why the the regular regulation process is deliberately slow that is\nIt takes a long time to adopt a rag but once again it takes a long time to get rid of it and I understand that because it because anyone rag may have a big effect on industries on people on businesses and everything else\nYou don't want to see um whipped sawed\nBut I guess I Wonder as we've gone from a much slower age\nTo now an age where things change dramatically and they change very very fast does government need to have\nThe ability to come up to speed quickly so when you see a problem and say this problem is exacerbated by this rule we need to get rid of this quickly that there's that ability without putting people in a you know if you go out and say hey coal industry animal\nOut all this I don't drink and then to you know six months later you know forget to take all the filtering back out or or any industry\nEverybody sign is formed no forget about that don't do it I understand the ... effect\nBut is there a way to quickly respond when either the private sector or the government sees something that's a problem and they realized the only way to fix it does get rid of that rule oh I'm Sorry that's a very long involve process senator we won't be able to do that what can we do to balance those two needs\nRight well as you know and as they say the constitution is perfect but it's better than what we have now yeah the problem we have with this administrative state is that you do have these unelected agencies that are making those weak on the first place what a lot of proposals are and there's legislation to do this in the house has passed\nI I guess I get to go talk that regulates how it's done its job at double regulatory reform bill should set it in this environment you can't even begin to get anything earth\nBut what you have to do is when a little complicated but win or lose costly Congress needs to prove that little that's the only thing that is going to be able to give the certainty that the businesses need you know they also said there's a lot of regulatory uncertainty but sometimes just the certainty\nIf you regulate it\nAnd we were having a heck of a tough for a decade with these net neutrality rules\nSo you've got to have is law making is going to take place and especially in frontier sectors that are changing so fast like ... ... cars and robotics artificial intelligence\nAt cyber security you've got to have Congress make clear rules we can't

selection\nAnother high percentage offers selection for eye color as well in a high percentage of people who go for sex selection or gender selection are doing it because they want their family to be

one of one Jake UGA ...\n[laughter] [noise] we'll\nCome back from a large large city show it was a pleasure to be with you on a Thursday evening we try to talk about all the issues in front of America\nAnd the last several weeks cabin on forward have been the big dominant topic but I thought we talk about a few other important issues while we've got the time John Tammany is the director of this\nAnd author of the book the end of work John it's good to have you on the program again thanks\nA large great to be here thanks for having me on\nYou know the the Federal Reserve gets under people's skin and it did get under my skin as well and there have been times I've heard from people who say let's just get rid of it all together and I've I've said well\nI'm not sure we need to get rid of it altogether but I mean it certainly should be reined in but is there a way that we can get by without a a bank of last resort in the form of the Federal Reserve because I'd love to get to a private sector solution to that\nOh yeah ... without question or\nThe fed exists as a lender of last resort as you just put it but what can't be stressed enough is that it's unheard of\nFor a solvent banks to ever go to the fed for alone because to do so is the mission of bankruptcy and what that means the federal leagues is to loan to insolvent banks which is not what it's supposed to do so we don't need it for that the feds also bank regulator\nBut if you're a bank regulator that usually means you couldn't get a job at a real bad\nAs we saw a thousand eight the fed was fed had no clue about the problems within banks and so it can't do a good job there and then it aims to target\nThe overnight rate which banks lend to one another you know an interest rates are price like any other you don't need the fed for that so I think this notion that the fed serve some useful essential purpose is easy to disapprove we could get rid of it and most wouldn't notice it at all\nIn fact I don't particularly like the fact that they regulate the interest rate that they're not that the federal government views them as a way to when the economy starts to heat up\nThat the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates artificially outside of market forces and say we need to cool it down and in theory there the the folks that when the economy cools down and we don't want it to be too cold\nThat they come in and say well we'll drop interest rates artificially\nTo try to pump it back up again I don't like that either even though I'm I'm well aware of the positive effects that has for some people I think it's a terrible I Would rather have the price be like the price of gasoline or the price of oil or the price of any other commodity because really at the end of the day money's just another commodity isn't it\nAll yeah yeah absolutely and and what ... what should be stressed there is the\nIs that the fed can't really alter the price of credit or why do we borrow money we borrow money because it can be exchanged for real resources like trucks tractors computers desk chairs buildings labor most specifically in such a reminder that we create the credit we create the resources that\nPeople are looking to borrow and they borrow money and so this idea that the fed can just decree the cost of credit cheap\nIs as silly as the mayor of Portland saying okay the top of mount that you can charge for a apartment rentals in Portland is a hundred dollars a month okay well demand for for those rentals would be high but supply would be non existent\nThe fed can't decree resources cheap so I think even there we give the fed way too much credit this idea that it can eat up the economy and slow it down I don't take very seriously\nIs there an and I don't either because you know all the way through from away when the initial you know we fell off the edge of the cliff\nOut all the way to June of oh nine when officially the recession was over I like to remind people of that because they want to credit Obama with fixing the uh you know the the recession and I say really he fixed it between January twenty up in the middle of June that's pretty amazing he didn't have time to do anything what did he do exactly\nAnd they say well you know you fix the economy well he didn't but\nOr or even below zero so that will pump the economy backup gun clearly you didn't do over eight years what Trump is management regulatory reform and tax reform over just a couple of years so I don't buy that one either one of the best way than to sort of back\nDown and start to dismantle this uh you know the role that the fed has if we can get the political will to do that and speak to that too if you don't mind\nWell you know let's let's hit on a couple of those things ... is that are crucial for one the recession was the sign of the recovery\nA recession it's merely signals and economy cleansing itself the misuse of labor or the bad habits developed the lousy companies the badly vestments and so when you get out of the way of the recession your setting the stage for the recovery\nAnd so that's the first thing I Would say a ... president can't the best thing that President can do\nIs just do nothing and then then you have your recovery um in terms of dismantling the fed\nAgain I I think you just decide you prove why we don't need it the fed can't make credit inexpensive it can't push the rate to zero and suddenly you think that that's resources oh the ... going to say the resource ... is they want to think that the fed can make that so\nNo no more no more than the fed could control the economy by saying well if things are bad let's drop the price of oil to ten bucks a barrel and then the economy will take off like a rocket because gas and diesel be cheap and that's where the economy runs on no they can't do and and\nAnd so you nail it you hit it on the head so the fed could never say OK oil is going to be cheap now and oil and and make oil plentiful by saying that what the fed would do if it could\nJohn I lost you there for justice are going to use ... go ahead do you have dropped out for a second\nOh I'm Sorry the fed the fed setting the price of oil and with the ... oil scarce they're just wouldn't be any oil to buy and so implicit in and pushing the interest rate down to zero is that the fed can decree all resources near cost less\nTo access which we know logically it cannot do and so dismantle the fed yes statements the obvious what could possibly do to stimulate or help the economy it quite simply cannot do what its critics and supporters alike believe it can't\nSo ... who wants to keep it around John\nOh I think you and I know exactly who wants to keep it around the fed is a convenient whipping boy for Congress\nAnd the convenient whipping boy for the president any time we have a recession\nWhich is again a sign of an economy cleansing itself of of what's not working Congress want someone to point to and so does the president oh the fed raise interest rates the fed tighten credit effect ... and credit then then again the fed could could make it difficult to buy oil\nThese prices are set in the market and so we're always going to have the Federal Reserve around because Congress has a constituency and the banking system they want something to prop up what makes no sense during times of distress but they also want someone to blame and so\nYou know I say get rid of the fed make serves no purpose I think we operate its power one way or the other four never going to get rid of it is Congress want someone to point to when their policies are working\nWell I guess and you know you you kind of leave me with the answer John because I uh I'd ... I'd like to get rid of it and I'd like to know what it would take to incentive I ... in ... Congress or if it's\nBoy I looked set them up to you know something that they can beat on every time the economy isn't doing with their constituents want but let's get rid of this thing that serves no purpose and frankly as kind of a disturbing effect on the rest of us\n[noise] um well look I couldn't agree more ah my second book not to plug it is called ... leads the fed in which I make a case that the fed is is is rushing toward irrelevant it needs to be shut down but I I add if Congress won't do this\nMarkets are shutting down the fed for us they're increasingly making what makes no sense not very well but but I agree with you I think Congress should have the courage\nTo say we don't need this and in fact if it serves any purpose at all it serves a purpose that weakens overall economic activity that weakens the banking system that that it delays recoveries that our rights that our our our right\nAnd it is the Germans or realize what's happening they they send about five men after him including one officer\nAnd your kids out of ammunition with his rifle and he pulls out his forty five\nPistol and shoots the last man in the row down in the front man and just keeps going and he just knocks them down and you know what's really remarkable is\nYour story as it sounds so we're legally fills twenty eight men but they did about ten years ago they went back to these Oregon and the battlefield archeology\nYork basis this incredible uh stand if you will and they found a forty five cartridges over forty of them along with is thirty six ammunition in that exact spot\nAnd and you wrote that as you went you know he told his men because this was the guys you said from the mountains in fact there's a great old movie in which he's portrayed and are they talking about what I recommend it oh it's a great movie you know it's an old movie it's not ... if I remember right who was Gary Cooper in black and white was an it\nIt was it was Nineteen forty one and it won a number of awards and uh it's really a wonderful movie it's worth the orders that revisiting a you know your listeners out there go watch it again it's great love it\nSo he's a great strategist as well because you wrote that all the officers were dead so he takes command as a corporal and then when he finishes shooting a bunch of these machine governors in the head every time I had come up I'd done knocked it down and he said\nAnd then you said he went right down the position points is forty five at the Germans had and says\nTell your men to stop firing the German blow the whistle on up and down the line all the enemy soldiers stop firing they just stopped\n[noise] they stop and it's a it's incredible they he captures with along with some of the men in his patrol over a hundred and thirty Germans\nAnd they marched them back you know miraculously back to American lives and I wrote a piece of Breitbart on Sunday where the commanding general says well York I hear you catch the whole day observing army but he's sort of laughs it obviously I got a few\nI feel a hundred and thirty two and edited yes this is the kind of story that I Want Americans to remember because you know we're used to go into the movies and seeing you know stories of the single man or a single woman who couldn't run out there and do amazing feeds on his own but this is a guy who actually did it for real and as I recall the story\nBecause after I watched the movie and this was a while back a year or two ago\nI went back and read the history of the real history the man when he came back he was kind of surprised that the I I think the community built um a house\nYou know he was he was not a wealthy guy he was he was not even you know a guy with a lot of money in his pocket but the his community was very grateful for what he had done and he got all these offers a you know Hollywood wanted to see him and everything else and and he was just a symbol guy was ...\nHe was he didn't want to monetize the experience and I think that that makes him so exceptional it's not\nYou know ... you look at today where people are ... are constantly\nTrying to you know they would create a reality show around this York didn't want that and I think that that's what makes him exceptional along with that generation of Americans which no one hundred years later and they're largely forgotten but they're going to capture them in the unknowns the book I just wrote\nIn and that's why I wrote the book I wanted to let the Americans know about this generation and how important it is and how they change the world\nAnd in fact that if if if nothing else I guess maybe he was ... didn't they created a weapons system that was the York\nSay the sergeant York the uh yeah they there was an M. sixteens and have

[noise]\nYour work overly dries [noise]\nBut the reality is or not that funny\nIs your urban word so she's a day thank you for that indeed it urban points about our understanding is that there was an urban word of the day we damn structure cranium\nI just want to cross a week a crowd of a on a little more thorough so\nThey're at their Jeff Flake and ah if you've been living under a rock and you don't know what's going on with cabin on you're falling at all then it\nDoesn't matter if you have not really followed it today they had to vote they're going to send it to the floor except for there was one caviar it's going to be a week long investigation and the White House has already said they've authorized the FBI investigation into doctor bills you forge\nAllegations against him so we'll see how this goes ah I think for all intents and purposes\nYou know what it's gonna be tough I mean I I don't know how much is going to change and if we're going to learn anything because I still think it's going to be he said she said thing but\nLet's just get it over and done with and get it done a thorough investigation and it's not going to take weeks because you've only got a few people to interview with there was no crime scene no DNA no lab work so we'll see three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter\nTrump is an industry all to himself well last night something debuted\nWhat was it old TV show how to do we'll talk about that and she'll much much advantage of [noise]\n\nShot ... adventure and show [noise]\nDuring like cancer awareness month every September the ... the man let them decide he the world's largest nonprofit dedicated to fighting like cancer\nEducate them engaging the public about the blood cancer including the team yet lymphoma myeloma which is the third leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans Dr Glenn Nichols if the society's chief medical officer ...\nThe University of North Carolina Chapel Hill I probably said it wrong and somehow I've called three appropriated or ruin somebody's life or whatever [noise] some people like bigger phones fine keep an alternative for the rest of us I Can't grow my hands any bigger one eye fans waited please make a smaller phone British journalists Caroline a ... as\nA or cry Atta or whatever I don't know I'm just I'm Sorry if I mess it up uh she said she suffered from repetitive strain injury using the iPhone six which has a four point seven inch wide screen because it was too large for her grip\nButter symptoms went away when she switched to the budget friendly IPhone SE which is a four inch screen\n\nThese are the same people that are going to tell you you're ... it's about privilege right and when you tell me it's about frivolous I it's all about that\nIs your privilege right there because anybody who is worried about the size of the iPhone screen and how it affects your life\nYou ... it's\nThat you that's right there's tells me everything I Need to know this affects my life negatively 'cause the screen as David that's your problem in life\nCould you imagine that fell bill I Can't do this anymore the screen and my twelve hundred dollar iPhone is just to amazing in large for my hands I Can't go on you go on without me [laughter] I'm Still not watching a movie on my phone [noise]\nNow you don't want I I say that I watched the movie but like a I have watched\nUh like I'll watch a Youtube video I've watched like a Family Guy episode or something but I don't know if I could do a movie on my phone of full movie I can do like twenty minutes ten minutes but even at that point in time it's it's tough I think I watched half of the world cup game\n'cause I was travelling but outside of that which wasn't good because\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and show is your Twitter you can tweet\nAt us so today Jeff Flake or\nDecided to like you like do knows somebody to people treated me one person tax me today and said that he [noise]\nJeff Flake is the enemy of the United states of America because he said that\nHe wants to delay it a week and he agreed to to get it out of committee and buy get it out of committee was get cabin out of committee onto the floor\nWith the caviar being that there is a one week investigation with parameters of you only can investigate the allegations of glassy Ford and that's it so glassy Ford's allegations will\nBe investigated and it ... the insanity of\nIt all is just on both sides like like 'cause you can't win for losing right like listen to a a senator Mazie Hirono\nI'm here sending that my colleagues because it's very clear that the Republicans will break every ... every rule to get this ...\nYeah every norm every rule that's they're breaking every norm every ruled they're destroying everything\nEven though they've done is they've asked for this they're now getting this and it's still not enough which is fine but at least the American people can see the BS and I tell you what step\nBack for a second if you will with your the partisan red blue the whole nine yards if you're the Republicans you play this right now you're going to get him on the Supreme Court if he's not done anything I don't think he's done anything although I've been wrong before now will be wrong again\nBut on top of this you can play this partisanship into a a a ... and this trial in this entire dog and pony circus\n... they caused you can do this in a way that I think it helps you in a few weeks when it comes to the midterms\nI really really really really do here Senator Mitch McConnell offers to water above or one of the ... support\nThe motion to proceed to nominate one hundred percent of the Republican conference support\nFor saving the cup and all I'm gonna\nGo and I think that they're ... and while everybody jumping on flaking and hammering at him and he doesn't like Trump he doesn't like Trump he's leaving\nAnd I have a feeling once he leaves the Senate I wouldn't be surprised if he you know he's going to take a run I think at the White House potentially in two thousand twenty he doesn't like the way politics has gone on both sides of the aisle I agree with them in a lot of that because I'm not I'm not a huge fan\nAt the way that these things have come in and our tribalism right now and and and and as much as our tribalism is there and it's it's it's there for the world to see that's the issue for the world to see we're in a position where tribalism\nYears ago wasn't a newspaper and maybe at the water cooler now the water cooler follows you everywhere and we all have a voice so the tools to help the tribalism spawn it sells\nMore than anything else but I think there's always been a cultural thing here to battle now the cultural civil wars just getting louder and louder\nI still think he's going to vote and before everybody lays the blame completely Jeff Flake feet I have a feeling that Susan Collins as well as Lisa Murkowski\nAnd a few others spoke to him saying is there any way 'cause he was the only one that that there were there wasn't Collins or anybody else on that that that Senate judicial committee that could have done this enforce this\nThey all want to vote for him and I do believe he has a real good shot of getting this as long as there isn't anything to insane in this ... but I really do believe that and but I think they wanted to be sure\nBecause they have to go back to their constituents and they realize the magnitude not only of the fact that there are up for votes but they also realize the magnitude of what potentially could happen here if he gets on knowing that they helped get a judge on that potentially at least for some look at this is the greatest generational thing ... to change\nThe entire culture of America which I don't think it's gonna happen I think we're the hyperbole is like a world freaking out but it is what it is but I think they really pressed him to do this\nAnd it's frustrating absolutely trust me Mitch\nI come at our callers on the committee for sending this impressive nominated here to the floor with favorable recommendation that we will keep the process moving\nThe full set of over ... considering drugs Kavanaugh's nomination\nSo but they won't vote until they get back all of this stuff and I don't know what the stuff is going to say the the investigation is going to come up with a I think a lot of people I think and\nAnd and look I understand why someone like Mark judge that's the guy that everybody wants to use this march guy who's this character what's the all about\nHe is you know he's a guy that is a writer he is a conservative he has had a lot of issues when it comes to alcoholism and and a some issues like that\nUh with addiction and he's battled cancer and you know he's he's got some issues and and I'm interested to see out because they want to deposed him and they want to do it out in the open this that the the Democrats and they want to come after him and they want to do the exact opposite of what the Republicans did\nWhich I think with with with Dr Ford they did it a very good job and I think they handled the situation very well with the kid gloves I think they want to do the exact opposite with mark judge\n'cause they look at him as this evil privileged white guy and so it it's going to be very interesting to see see the way that this has handled because you're also putting your faith in a guy who had severe issues with alcohol and addiction\nWho ... you know that may not be the person that that's going to give you the answer is you want on either side\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and show is your Twitter you can tweet us a lot of stuff's still to get to want to hear from you what do you think movies this weekend get out of house enjoy yourself to touch on the movies that are out I went and saw one last night\nAnd it was creepy and it was fun most people
