I pass by it practically every day of my childhood as I went that way to go to school it was a it was a fixture in the community and which I grew up and you know\nInterestingly enough lawyers it was a place where I first saw a sign that as a inspired me\nLately to focus on a related topic but it it was a sign that said said Soviet Jews and I've been thinking about it you know this is obviously not only an expression of you know what people are safe do it their best which just care about others but\nIt is a reminder now that it can be energy that used to worry about Jews and the Soviet Union now has to like Jews in Europe or even worry about\nTheir safety in our own country and this is a very very bad\nSide of what has been happening in terms of ah the rising\nNot only anti Semitism but uh anti\nIsrael sentiments a and and more generally uh I I think a a hatred for people who are art of a well\nFrankly are primarily art of the left or archery as the premises so or often allied with the left and that's a that's a very worrying as I say statement about what's happening in our country more broadly\nYeah because you warned us for a long time that uh with the rise of sharia law in in various places in the middle east with a hint of it at least in part to Western Europe like France and even in England that we worry here about folks you know handing out offensive leaflets or or\nUh you know they they'll go in and they'll they'll vandalize the synagogue um but we don't often hear about people literally committing murder although Seattle at a murder that was aimed at a Jewish citizens\nAre not too many years ago\nAnd I guess I just wonder are people aware that that that is going to seem small by comparison ... takes rude because under surreal law uh both Christians and Jews\nAre are going to be a are going to be a uh the the targets in that one night and I also want you to tie in with answering why you think there may have been a a really dramatic rise in the number of of active\nAnti Semitism and hatred towards Jews lately or has there been\nWell I think there are reportedly a bore I'm certainly in Europe it's on the state couple and I think that has an awful lot to do largely with the rising presence and increasingly in bolted\nAttitude of a ... ... you know they've they've poured into Europe\nOr by the millions [noise] I'm not all Muslims are sure is a process as we've talked about uh we're talking about a subset of them but unfortunately there are there are hundreds of millions of people who believe that this a totalitarian brutally\nRepressive Eddie Semitic aside shouldn't mistake homophobic\n... brutally repressive anti Semitic aside shouldn't mistake homophobic or intolerant\nDoctrine of authoritative Islam is a is being practiced increasingly in Europe and it's creating I think an environment that's dangerous they're much as we're seeing in other parts of the world it's a it's it's dangerous for both Jews and Christians and as I said that\nSign outside the synagogue a tree of life that squirrel hill\nCommitted in Pittsburgh inspired an effort that I've been involved in a coal to save the persecuted Christians\nCoalition and we're looking at in addition to what Jews are experiencing a two hundred and Fifteen million Christians around the world are being heavily persecuted I don't mean they're just having a hard time getting a job or\nYou know people are unpleasant to the I tell you about people are being tortured or raped or a driven from their homes or a crucified or or\nMurder on mass\nAnd that is part and parcel of what's going on it's not just let me be clear it's not just Islamists who are doing it but an awful lot of them are are beating the state at the hands of those folks and we need to be alive to the fact that it's a it's it's creeping a through\nVarious parts of the western world ... just as an example are like just another skirt out this just this past week\nA good friend of mine a woman by the name of Elizabeth satellite dish Wolf of Austria or was founded by the European Court of human rights to have trans grass by\nSpeaking about the prophet Muhammad\nExercising her freedom of speech which he has the right to do it's not\nConstitutionally guaranteed is here but even in Europe you have a right under their human rights convention to speak but apparently according to the court not if you offend others\nReligious feelings as they put it well that's a real blast with me and that is the leading edge of the effort to force a you know a civilization to submit to this\nTrivia doctrine and program it ...\nIs very and let me throw another idea at you and this one's one I just just occurred to me as you were speaking about that Frank\nYou remember how we worried over the last couple of years did the Soviet Union tried to use Facebook and other social media or it's not some union Russia or did they use it to try to change the outcome of an election and we also while their their efforts were kind of puny\nUh but you know we don't want people doing that anyway or having a foreign power trying to interfere with our elections\nI heard the discussion the other night that was talking about the fact that an awful lot of these anti Semite like Robert ... hours a you know the guy who said do all the Jews must die as he was being taken into custody in synagogue on Saturday\nThey've been pushed off can most conventional social media because social media sites like Twitter and Facebook say we don't want you on your so they've gone to other alternative ones that are more you know wild wild west when it comes to you can say anything you want\nAnd they said that you know in some ways that's good because it gets them away from the conventional sites where most of the people are focusing their social media but his bad in the sense that they almost disappeared from public view until they pop up doing something like what Robert Bowers is accused of doing and it occurred to me\nIf you were in the middle east and you are a real law you know a a proponent for at here and and you said how can we\nSee if you were in the middle east and you are a ... law you know a a proponent for at here and and you said how can we screw things up in America and how can we advance our cause because they clearly hate Israel and hate the Jewish people\nOne of the ways they might do it and they could do it from a distance would be to get on social media and encourage the Robert Ballard is the world couldn't they but does anybody even looking for that phenomena\n[noise] I I think people are are perhaps not enough and maybe not aggressively enough but let me just add something to surround out what you said you hours because it seems to me that it's at least as problematic that\nA while the social media platforms that Google's Facebook's the twitters and so on are are\nMigrating Robert Bauer his office there pages on the grounds that they're saying violent or hateful things they're also\nUsing the Southern Poverty Law Center which is a political warfare instrument of the left to try to keep people like well lady for example for losing their platforms and\nOf course Congress it does have authority to extend the citizenship to whomever it lives but it's never acted to extend citizenship this far and so a really this could be corrected today tomorrow\nIt doesn't need an amendment to the constitution as many people who've objected to the\nRumors about what President Trump is planning to do it doesn't actually required amendments of the constitution the change of this it's really been a mistake and application of\nThe fourteenth amendment by the other branches that has given us this problem\nWell if there's no statutory law to speak up on those and there is the amendment and all it takes is the bureaucracy to behave differently as you said\nThe passport office or any other government agency that takes into account where you are what what country you're a citizen of primarily the state department than it is within the president's power to say stop issuing passport or any other documents to people who are not citizens by birth right\nAnd and then the economy I understand it but to actually\nWhat what we have is we have a a statute eight USC fourteen or want it simply would teach the language of the fourteenth amendment including saying subject to the jurisdiction there other than it's been executive application or you could say miss application\nOf this language it's given us the current problem and the president wanted to correct it I don't see any reason why he couldn't correct it of course what we've seen during the Trump Administration is that\nFederal judges hostile to the president have\nFloored at his attempts to exercise is a legitimate authority in connection with in resume aggressive foreign people so I suppose we could expect to kind of blow up in the lower federal courts about this if the president acted on it but it could well be that now there are five votes on the Supreme Court to uphold his decision\nWell and in this case that law was written I think in fifty two and the other one we spend a lot of time with I think it was the McCarron act was written in fifty five do you think that the legislative history is it the members of Congress in Nineteen fifty to all the way back to what are we talking about our eyes and our the tail\nTail end you know I think it would be Eisenhower at that point wouldn't it or was it ...\nFifty twos Truman yeah of course we have there's a general rule in in the law that where you have\nA language that's been used before being repeated it should be understood as having the same meaning so what that would mean is if\nIf the Congress uses language directly from the fourteenth amendment we should understand the language of the Congress has used as having the same meaning as it had in the fourteenth amendment which gets back to what I was saying before about what the chief author and another one of the most prominent are proponents in Congress said this\nThis phrase allergy subject to the jurisdiction there of men and again what they said it meant was that the person in question didn't ... any allegiance to any foreign state so that would not cover uh foreigners it would not cover anchor babies that would not cover birth terrorists would not cover any of these people\nAnd in fact you could start applying that right now although I Wonder about the practical application\nBecause it gives it today's practical application if a if a South Korean mom flies into Los Angeles or Seattle stays for a few weeks delivers a baby and goes home she likely goes home with a birth certificate from the state of California which is a sanctuary state so does that become definitive of what and who that child is\nIt was sort of a good from the state of California which is a sanctuary state so does that become definitive of what and who that child is or is it the U.S government's policy at the time they were born the definitive\nBecause if they go home to South Korea with mom and the kid turns Eighteen and then says okay mom I'm headed back to America since I'm a citizen\nDoes it matter what what we said today or does it matter what the policy is Twenty years from now or Eighteen years from now when the kid comes back to America hoping to establish himself and then at some point bring six or eight of his family members with it\n[laughter] well this is the kind of question that has a law professor would give it a sign [laughter] to try to answer of course the the legal answer I think is that that doesn't matter but practical answer is well\nI'm the president Eighteen years from now could order that he'd be given a passport so on the other hand of course\nYou think Hillary will be running Eighteen years from now she's running right now I think so why not [laughter]\nWell I'm a ... I don't know that I Want to get up into those weeds\nAnd I need to narrow the Hillary Clinton says she's still available for the ... for the residency if anybody wants her\nI really liked to be president\nHe lives in a doctor goods when I appreciate this listen I was so happy this morning when I woke up and I saw that tweet and I thought I'd been asking\nFor this on the radio for Twenty one

guard this morning when the president tweeted out kind of the unofficial way that he\nAnnounces a lotta new policies that he's going to change the interpretation of the federal government reading the fourteenth amendment that catch anybody off guard\nNot caught off guard at all I listen to the president has been trying to fix the problem of immigration a since he became president of the United states you'll remember to October's or do we put forth a Seventy point plan of how to fix immigration Democrats wouldn't come to the table he didn't Joel to down to four main pillars are the

thousands of migrants coming here who's stated goal is to break our laws in the coming in this country it's unacceptable and the present won't stand for it anymore\nNow Hogan I Know that all the details of those have not been written yet but since you and I and the president role in the same page on this thing I told you I've I've asked for Twenty one years for a different interpretation of the fourteenth amendment but let me step through some of the counter arguments there are people who are going to say not me I don't agree with those but I Want to I Want people to hear your answer\nThe president is trying to change the constitution with this executive order is that it is that act\nNo absolutely not I mean there's plenty of people on the side of you uh Lars Larson who believe that that interpretation was faulty from the gecko\nAnd Madison is doing arson has had a ... hour doing hey we left wing mob and\nCongress don't get much worse I'm Wendy Rogers Republican for

S C\nI have to admit it didn't actually for the longest time I was kind of a political not that I wasn't interested in it but as a reporter I kept my opinions out of my story is not had personal opinions\nThat I Would say but I was always careful to keep them out so for a lot of people they they looked at me on TALK radio a long time ago and so you're a conservative or you're not a liberal you worked in television I said yeah I had my own opinions but\nI kept him out of my work 'cause that was my job at the time I'm ... I Want you to describe depths of the nation your most recent documentary that's now out on DVD and why people should go out and get it now that is available in that form\nWell because we talk a lot about fake news but we don't talk enough about scholarships and fake history and steak narrative in the last makes accusations against Trump and the conservative or example they prompted the fashion the Republican Party is the party of fascism\nThe highway that is that kind of meta narrative a big story and the story is that fascism is on the right back at them as as a likely Saddam and it is actually like the right way for the whole argument would collapse and that notion fascism as directly phenomenon that's been something that left settled\nIn the Nineteen forties they've got it into the textbooks\nThat got it on the History Channel they've got it in the wake of media and so a lot of people close no it could be true even though it's not true fascism was never the not the right prior to that\nBut what we're seeing is regret that his story obviously that has been a kind of laughed and all of us that's captive in ... I watched the movie is try to do that the nation\nIs Rick you out of that law show you a history as it was actually experienced by the people who lived through it and the twenties and thirties a kind of fresh look at our own American story\nSo when you see it in the new like you'll never be the quite the same like at\nNo in fact I think that's true of all the documentaries you've done and I cite them frequently in conversations with people and say go watch this documentary and understand the real relationship this store relationship between say the United states and Mexico where our current relationship is a little bit strained\nBut some of that may go back in history but some of it was settled a long time ago in the United states\nWe're our current relationship is a little bit strained\nBut some of that may go back in history but some of it was settled a long time ago in the United states I think acted very honorably and its relations toward a much less powerful a state of Mexico back in the day and and and we subtly you're your own country great uh but but then you have to be responsible for your people\nYes absolutely so that Louisiana who typically a book that goes with the movie um the ... is an emotional narrative ... it's hard for them firing the book is titled the references and flipped out\nSo it's kind of way of putting out a one two punch and the left has not been able to poke a single whole into this they like to screen in general and misrepresent what out Damascus claiming that it was a liberal Democrat nonsense I'm not saying that it's not even remotely but I'm saying but what I Am saying is that if you're looking for the vestiges of fascist\nTactics in America today you'd be far more likely to find them on the left and on the right\nOne in fact aren't most I mean many of the policies that are being pushed by the most radical elements of the Democratic party including or cause you a court chosen Gillum and others is blood type nationalized healthcare let's do this you know and a lot of policies that they weren't the let's take over the world policies of the Hitler regime but they certainly are socialist policies\nAnd I always like to remind them what Nazi actually stands for\n[noise] yeah I mean one of the cost think back to fascism and not is and we think of World War two and get it again but and and why does it come out of the war with fascism but not with not portrayed like that that's not how the fascist became the largest political party\nBoth in Germany and that and\nAn hour earlier in Italy or they became the largest party by hand painting on government takeover of the bank and health care government control of education is any government control not only of the organs of the economy but also over the life of citizens that would eat mold and what kind of a single unit\nOr ... if you will with leftist ideology\nThat's what they're not east coast lifestyle song meaning and in a sense coordination and that's what the left is trying to do in their own way in America today eat at all in this mission intimidate us all into that you need to stay in tune in and buying our own plastic I fly off the overall balconies\nWell it'll be interesting to see what happens after the midterms a week from today didn't ask ... nation it's now on store shelves anywhere DVDs are sold and didn't actually it's always a pleasure to have your own thing 'cause her\nValue that is diminished as soon as the best selling author and filmmaker\nAnd want to remind you of something that's very very practical it's about sleep how\nDoes a great night sleep improve your performance I can tell you how about more energy less brain far better mood and more productivity I work twelve or Thirteen hours a day the new sleeve number three sixty smart bed it helps people like me to get great performance\nEvery day my sleep number setting of sixty five Tina's is more like a thirty five or forty a much softer mattress\nFirst on the scene but that was under the same model that we we were not\nGetting our message out at the at our age mainstream media channels certainly not in a spare fashion so we said you know ... that work\nAnd and so we did the same thing that people are fed up with hearing lives with hearing propaganda with with hearing hatred\nSimply because somebody disagrees with them and you talked earlier about uh the violent rhetoric I have not heard one Republican Lars have you that does not denounced violence does not that now it's a little rioting is not that now it's breaking the law yet it is all the Democrats\nThat either enable them to do this exit amounted to that you hear so many mayors say well we need to give them room to fry it you're not going to hear a Republican or conservative say that now and it's only the Democrats that push that\nI'm Talking to ... who's a host for enter a TV you might remember him as the guy who smashed the TV that was showing liberal news and I'm sure grants that will be brought back up when they decide to tar and feather you for your violent actions which were merely to convey a you know convey a message\nAnd of course at the same time not acknowledge that they've done things like you know showing image of Paul Ryan allegedly throwing somebody off of a ... off a cliff in a wheelchair you know because that was that was an okay message been smashing an inanimate object that's pure evil\nField share you know because that was that was an okay message good smashing an inanimate object that's pure evil\nIt you know I Want to tell you it was one of the most fun shoots I've ever been on and I've been in t._v. for a long time my background as mainstream media was an investigative reporter before I ran for Congress and then got into talk radio and working that enter ATV and that was the most part I had so what we did for people that I hadn't seen it as we played clips of\nAll the deceitful media say horrible things about the n._r._a. and the president and conservatives our race is a lot of ads and all these things and\nIt pulls out with me wearing a T shirt that says socialist tears and I have a sledgehammer and I smashed the TV\nAnd I had to look really mean right while doing it but it was the hardest thing because we laugh at all of this thing is the GPS going fly at all we did is what the left doesn't do we smashed our own property we paid for property we didn't do it to anybody else's property you know what the brilliant part of that video was\nLaws that I didn't say a word and we did not have a gun and they still\nWent ballistic over at no guns do speech nothing and of course they said we were being violet were not being violent we were just acting out what everybody wants to do they want to smash their TV when they're tired of being hammered over the head with nonsense every\nNight I'm Talking to ... hosted in or a TV you know one of the things that bothers me grant the fake news doesn't all have to come in statements of of of untrue fact\nIt can also come by omission and you know when I heard about the shooting at the synagogue on Saturday I was following Twitter and I thought oh my God this is horrible I said a prayer for those people but I also thought about my friend John ...\nWho runs a crime prevention Research Center who points out that Ninety eight percent of all the mass shootings in American I'm tired of hearing about them to I Want them to stop\nBut they happen in gun free zones now I I didn't do a full catalogue of what network news did but I'm willing to bet that not a single one mentioned these mass shootings happen in places that are disarmed and then make the very simple point\nShe I mean if a reporter at a network I ever had the inclination say\nHow do we protect the important stuff and he ... he or she just went through his day and said well I went to a ball game at a stadium the other day and they were armed cops or guards there and went to a shopping mall armed guards the building I mean right now armed guards most banks aren't you know go right down the list lots and lots of places the important places are protected by that\nWell I've always thought the schools in houses of worship should be protected as well not by government edict\nBut voluntarily and then when you decide not to do that\nIt's like me deciding not to wear my seatbelt I'm not blaming the victim I'm just saying I wear my seatbelt even though I've never had a seatbelt saved me from Syria's arm but also where gun every day even though I've never had that saved me from serious harm yet\nThat that's right but you never know when it's going to happen you never know what you're going to get a car accident you'd never know if you're gonna get Nick on site if you will comes calling and so I'm with you\nI mean my goal is to empower every single person that wants to carry a firearm law in a law abiding fashion to have the right to do so so many places are trying to take away that right but that's all the second amendment is about is protecting yourself and your family\nSo you have a right to do that and as soon as the liberals can realize the second amendment as Elvis\nRecord is called on it is not going away anytime soon the quicker they need to get over the hurdles of of trying to live in this fantasy world\nWas somehow evil doesn't doesn't exist and so I'm with you about the line by omission gun free zones are dangerous and you can see this in every single news story that you either read or see on TV it's what they don't tell\nIn the story that is really is really the uh the deceitful methods that these dogs\nYou either read or see on TV it's what they don't tell\nYou in the story that is really is really the uh the deceitful illness that's\nThat's used dogs is that's the dog doesn't bark watch for for instance field on enter a TV and granted it's always great talking to you thanks so much hold on for just a

course the biggest story of the day and these days there seems to be a brand new huge story every couple of days in fact some stories from just a month ago seemed like oh yeah I remembered seems like ten years ago anyway here's the situation\nI see American we have a caravan of illegal aliens and I had somebody question me why I was calling the caravan and Mexico illegal aliens and he said they're not illegal aliens till they reach America and I said oh no that's not true\nOr those people legally in the state of Mexico\nAnd the answer is you know is no they forced their way into that country now the Mexican government has been pretty accommodating toward them\nBut they didn't end of the uh the state of Mexico legally they're not they're legally in Mexico is said to them\nBecome to Mexico City will make sure that you can stay here will help get your jobs and all the rest of that and they've said no so they're not even refugees\nBecause refugees who are fleeing from a country in some kind of persecution international law says when you're playing as soon as you get to a safe place you're no longer refugee so that's all going on\nAt the same time that the president came out this morning and said I'm going to ride an executive order in which I tell the bureaucracy of the government to stop miss interpreting the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nWhich for a hundred years well effectively about a half a century about fifty years\nEverybody in the federal government has said well you know if you have a baby in America the baby's automatically an American citizen and as I've said read the fourteenth amendment I've read it on the air\nIt's not very long it says your baby as an American citizen if you are under the jurisdiction of the United states that is you know allegiance to a foreign king are potent said\nThat your allegiance is to America because you came into the country legally so the president launches that which I think is perfectly appropriate will finally get a court tested likely won't happen for years but you know Donald Trump is going to get sued over this\nThey're going to be people saying we're going to sue to stop that executive order and I've told you to that for those of you said the large aren't you a ... against executive orders\nI'm only against executive orders when they take the place of legislation and if you want to

stopped so that they don't challenge our national sovereignty and tried to come into across our border illegally\nWell I think the first thing that has to happen as a resource thing at the border I just really rational question you know President Trump has sent a thousand troops to the border and that's great and that'll provide you know I think some security but the issue is we don't have enough judges ordered process asylum close and we certainly don't have enough\nA resource it in terms of border security and and or to patrol the border and we don't have the president's order wall so all of that\nHas to be funded by Congress any future care of and it's like\nYou know I saw a number today that says that the birds to illegal alien parents in this country that are primarily covered by Medicaid and public funding through hospitals in such\nThe total amount of money that we spend a every year is greater than the amount of money they're talking about to start building the wall so it is to me it would be a fairly easy economics choice would you rather have a wall and stop people from coming into the country illegally or would you rather just leave the border opened a lot of people come in and\nAnd have babies and we'll we'll ... we'll pay for all the costs are I Would rather they didn't even get to the other side of the border\nUh but I Want to stop them legally in humanely but I don't even want him to stand in front of a judge I I Want them to be stopped before they get to the borders there is there any hope of that Rachel\nWell I think for that to happen we have to clean up our asylum laws because right now that's what he said if I think a lot of these people to come here and if you listen to the interview with you on the care of and that's what they had you become an acquaintance island and now there are legitimate asylum claim but right now\nBecause of changes at the Obama administration made people can claim what's called credible fear and that's a very low threshold for asylum because we don't have the resources to the border to hold everyone uh we we take their asylum claim and then we released them\nInto the interior of the country and they're given a court date sometimes years later which many ... do not ever show for and then they're here illegally and that is what many what's attracting I think a lot of people in the caravan is the idea they know they can claim asylum in the lead into the country and they never have to show again\nWe need to fix those laws\nBefore any when it when you get hurt and the teacher\nBecause right now they know they know that the ... we've we've tied ourselves up with all this bureaucracy saying yes we have a border\nBut if you managed to get across to you have full constitutional rights we have to give you an order to appear we don't have a lot of judges so that's going to take months we can't lock you up for months there's another court decision that says we can only hold you for a certain period of time so people know there'll be catch and release on the north side of the border and then they just disappear\nAnd if they don't show up for the court hearing there's not much enforcement there because many of the big cities they disappear into our sanctuary cities that say we're not going to help ice enforce the law so we've strangled\nOr because many of the big cities they disappear into our sanctuary cities that say we're not going to help ice enforce the law so we've strangled our society by writing a stack of laws that work against enforcement of the border instead of Fort enforce the border\nYeah I think that's right and that's honestly what's incentivizing a lot of people to come here and are the fact that we have is a little post we have these things where he said he is you have all these things\nThey know they just have to get into the country and they'll likely be able to stay and that's a huge incentive for ... and I point out\nYou know that's not just the threat obviously to our security and our sovereignty but it's a threat to people as they come and I think that's what's so frustrating you know the mainstream media ignored the caravan but they also ignore the huge humanitarian crisis that this within a legal immigration you have\nDrug traffickers is sex traffickers who pray on these people\nAre so it's not just changing the law for our benefit it's changing lives up for for the pizza for the benefit of people who come here and math and and are exploited\nYou know as as we began this conversation Rachel and made mentioned in the sun but I played a few minutes ago where a Fox News reporter drift Jenkins talked to one of the people in the Caribbean\nAnd the guy freely and easily said yeah I'm a I'm a third class or third degree felony because I was convicted of attempted murder in the United states and I'm coming north so I can ask for a pardon\nAnd you know I wouldn't put money on [laughter] but but that's amazing that that there are people in that group who are so concerned about their own criminal act\nDid they say yeah I'm a felon I tried to murder somebody and I was convicted of it and then they kicked me out of the country and now I'm coming right back in I Would think that would scare the daylights out of Americans who've been told by Donald Trump that\nLike it or not the crowd of illegal aliens who come in illegally contains a disproportionate number of people who are violent criminals and then they're told by the mainstream media all that's that's a bunch of bologna Trump does nobody's talking about well the fact is\nI've looked at the the stats in my own state and found that it's absolutely backed up a you know she's Oregon is a very blue state where we ever broadcast studios and a\nEighteen percent of the convicted rapist and the state bar illegal aliens and fourteen percent of the convicted murderers are illegal aliens even though the percentage of illegal aliens in the state might be three or four percent at most but they they are vastly\nOver represented in the crowd of killers and rape is\nWhat we have a problem with criminals coming here as illegal aliens and the first place to look at things that he is because we aren't doing the proper vetting we aren't doing the proper enforcement that which I think we move a lot of the people\nI think Americans largely are welcoming to immigrants that come here legally but how many lives here legally yeah we can't that you can't do any of the take any of the measures necessary to make sure as security and that's why I think you know you have people taking advantage of the lack system because they know\nThey know they're ... it's been middle they can come here and be protected and that's upstate out backwards in any\nCase of Rachel assuming that Republicans get a decent result out of next Tuesday's election assume that Republicans maintain control perhaps even gain some seats in the Senate but at least main getting control of both houses of Congress\nCan we actually get something done because you've got a\nPowerful forces working against the president like house Speaker Paul Ryan who didn't wait ten seconds today before he jumped out and condemned Trump's idea of re interpreting the fourteenth amendment which is not a change in the law is not a not anything outrageous are extraordinary of just saying we've been missing\nOf re interpreting the fourteenth amendment which is not a change in the law is not a not anything outrageous are extraordinary just saying we've been misinterpreting and the first thing Paul Ryan who think God can be done soon enough\nFor my money uh he uh he comes out and immediately says it's not possible it's not true and is not going to happen so can we get something done if we maintain control of the Congress\nWell look I think if Republicans maintain control they absolutely have to get something done I mean not a mandate that voters of immigration is still one of the top issues on the minds of voters get a Gallup poll a July show that it was\nThe top issue on the minds of voters\nBiggest ... history in terms of identification but I think something but I Do think even before a January Republicans in Congress come back in December and have to vote on a funding package you think before they the new Congress gets sworn in that it may be their last chance to just on Trump's order well\nDoctor can do and maybe the\nActually doctor can do and maybe this is too blonde but I'm going to say it anyway I don't care if the conventional schools get hurt and here's why what I mean by that is if you have schools successful or failing schools that that you know that that uh then they have some competition in the form of a charter school\nAnd the parents look at what the charter schools doing for their kids and they look at what the conventional school is doing and they move either a sizable minority or even a majority of their students\nFrom the conventional school to the charter school because they now have a choice and they said this school is doing for my kids what I Need which is to get them a good solid education\nAnd the conventional school says hey we used to have a a thousand kids here and now we only have five hundred so we can only justify half\nThe staff and a half the teachers because the resources have gone across the street to the charter school that's OK even you know and and I and I wonder why\nYou know you're in a part of the country that has a lot of liberals but but it's also I mean there are businesses that are run most people who are you know not government workers are government workers are not the majority thank God would look at it and say well if my company does a better job than the competition the competition may lose business or even go out of business so what\nThat is how you breed excellence or in in any field in education and business in almost anything you know competition breeds excellence but competition usually means somebody wins and that means somebody has to lose why are people so concerned about saying oh we have to preserve this whole model that has been disturbing our kids\nWell I I agree with you completely that the older model is not something that should be preserved at a charter school here for example are closing achievement gaps for are low income children of color especially at a rate unprecedented in this nation I Would say that one of the places where not\nOnly Massachusetts gets it wrong but so many things get it wrong is that we have this cap on the number of schools that can exist so the reason they care about uh what how the districts both are performing for example is that not everybody has\nAccess to a charter public schools so here in the commonwealth we're twenty\nSix thousand individual kids on the list to get into these high performing charter public school if there weren't that cap I Would agree with you completely let the let the charter schools do what they know how to do closed up when they don't do it well and if the traditional public schools don't\nFare well in that system than they should close unfortunately I'm In too many places around the country as we do in Massachusetts we had the charter school cats which means that\nEven when families want to leave their district schools they can well and that's all\nI guess what I'm Wondering is why were the voters the taxpayers the parents willing to tolerate a cap\nIf if you said these schools are going to be great and clearly if the legislature and the people have voted in favor of of having charter schools to be made available it must be because they believe there is at least as good if not better than conventional schools why would you say this is going to be really great but you can only have a little bit of\nYeah well I think it's because believe me I I Wish that we would have a much more of it um but aggressively you know what we've got here is special interest groups that have a huge hold on the politics of education at the state if they do and many others and part of the ... is what we have failed to talk about here is a complete abolition of the cap and said\nWe may feel that they overtime let's raise it here let's re that there and so in that context you're always going to be vulnerable to the argument well\nEvery time you open a charter school in this community of that community it's going to drain\nAlways going to be vulnerable to the argument well\nEvery time you open a charter school in this community of that community it's going to drain funding from the traditional public school which by the way even true here because I'm with ya and ... and ... and ... them whereas it should I leave money follows the child is for the child and not for the theocracy or not but at the school not for the adult then that\nWould that would work but unfortunately here say in the context of the cat it it's not\nNot work by the way can I ask a detailed question about charters is not bad detail but in a lot of states charters good eighty percent of the money that a convention or does that also true of Massachusetts [noise]\nIt's not um I Would add that even when charters nationally get less funding that traditional public schools they still tend to outperform them a rose now comes yeah\nHere in Massachusetts we actually believe it or not having them for charter school funding where the money for charter schools fall if the child which means that um when I when a kid that you know what I don't want this district school I'm going to go to a charter is dead the money that is due to him or her goes directly to the charter so it actually\nAt one of the most equitable officers that Sunday in in the whole nation of course we don't get equal facilities earnings which means that we are to get it because our charter school operators either have to raise money to put a roof over kids' heads or get back to the money that they could use for operating school but we still managed to even with less\nMoney outperform proving that throwing money at education isn't always the answer you know what I thought if I was not the answer Dr ...
