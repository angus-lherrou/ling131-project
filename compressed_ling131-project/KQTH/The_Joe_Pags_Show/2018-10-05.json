radio controlled the plane and when I saw radio controlled helicopters I thought that would be fantastic now when I was a kid I never had the money to afford something like that\nI can afford it but I don't I don't have the time for that kind of thing but I'm fascinated with what drones and the promise they hold for being able to improve all kinds of things when used by various folks within our society and I've seen them used by farmers to make sure that their crop yields are up and it's amazing how that works\nI've seen them used in some cases by law enforcement the problem is\nWe males so she's amused by criminals while I've invited Jason ... who's a policy analyst at the ed wood nice Center for legal in judicial studies that heritage\nJason good to have you back on the program\nMakes your happening so do the police need the ability to be able to either shoot down or bring down drones if they end up being used not just by terrorists but by ordinary criminals as well\nBut the answer that question absolutely yes uh you know we're on the cost of really I think a revolution\nAnd what are they going to be able to do in terms of productive and positive things for society we're talking about engaging in life saving activities that can bring a emergency medical equipment to see if an accident ... minutes or helping to find someone who was lost in the community\nNeeded it uses the drones are being at the two right now and I think we're going to see a lot of that but we also see that uh you know as with any new technology is also a potential for misuse end abuse and there has certainly been uh\nIs that uh you know as with any new technology there's also a potential for misuse and abuse and there have certainly been a fair number of cases in just the last few months where drones are being put to watch a novel criminal or or even terrorists purposes and law enforcement uh unfortunately does not have\nPresently the ability to do much if anything to stop the\nJews and before we go to the ability to bring him down can you give us a couple of examples about ... have been using them\nShore so really what we're seeing\nIs that criminals are at least this innovative when it comes to to finding new uses for drugs as entrepreneurs and innovators of the commercial side uh we've we've looked at some of the instances at a at heritage what we were doing research on this and I was quite frankly floored by by how drawn to be used we've seen cases where\nA a you know common burglars are using drones to uh to case houses before they break in we've seen instances where drones are being used essentially to serve as\nA if you will a criminal Airforce actually surveilling the law enforcement personnel who are attempting to a Surveillance Act against organized crime or and then of course it it just last couple of months we've seen how drones can be used it in a terrorist attempt a when you look at the Venezuela instincts are incident excuse me\nA where allegedly there was an assassination attempt on the president of Venezuela and it was too drones arms with explosives that we're going to be the instruments for that assassination attempt so really it runs it runs the gamut but then there are also just cases where people are flying a neighbor gently or recklessly and there are a number of instances where drones have been observed\nIn the flight lines of airports and in fact you can go on YouTube and see a really impressive but clearly dangerous videos of drones just a few feet above a man jetliner coming in for a landing\nI'm trying to remember I thought I heard about that maybe it was just one those somebody imagining what they could be used for but you know that getting contraband inside of prisons has been a big business has literally\nCouldn't amount to millions of dollars whether it's drugs or weapons with those kinds of things and I'm Wondering whether or people who have tried to use that I Can't remember a specific example where that's been done\nBut I Would love to give the authorities the ability to bring drones like that down if they see one flying over in dropping contraband inside the walls\nYou're right that's a very real problem and in fact there there are some specific examples that come to mind where justice thing as has happened\nIn a correctional facility in Ohio for example a a drone was used to smuggle contraband into the prison there apparently it was a accidently drop in the wrong location it wound up in the hands of the wrong a prison gang within the prison walls\nAnd sparked a Seventy five inmate brawl or in another instance a prisoner was able to use tools that appear to have been smuggled in by drone to escape in a maximum security prison or and then at the southern border or not not a prison context but we see what our would have been dubbed narco drugs\nThat are being used to ferry drugs from Mexico into the United states\nOver the head of a border patrol agents who are just unfortunately powerless to do much beyond tracking those drugs to actually interdict though\nSo in cases like that should we have ... if we don't already have from the military the ability to electronically knocked these things out of the year should we allow law enforcement the latitude to shoot them out of the year if necessary\nYes or what we're talking about now is how to empower law enforcement agencies to engage in what's known as counter drone uh operations and\nCounter joint operations there they they run the gamut from a merely using what's known as an unmanned traffic management system essentially air traffic control for drones to restrict access to protest\nHum a merely using what's known as an unmanned traffic management system central air traffic control for

G H\n[noise]\nThe Federal Reserve gets under people's skin and it gets under my skin as well and there have been times I've heard from people who say let's just get rid of it all together and I've I've said well\nI'm not sure we need to get rid of it altogether but I mean certainly should be reined in but is there a way that we can get by without a a bank of last resort in the form of the Federal Reserve because I'd love to get to a private sector solution to that\nOh yeah ... without question or the fed exists as a lender of last resort as you just put it but what can't be stressed enough is that it's unheard of\nFor a solvent banks to ever go to the fed for alone because to do so is the mission of bankruptcy and what that means the federal exists to loan to insolvent banks which is not what it's supposed to do so we don't need it for that the feds also bank regulator\nBut if you're a bank regulator that usually means you couldn't get a job at a real bad\nAs we saw to a thousand eight the fed was fed had no clue about the problems with and banks and so it can't do a good job there and then it aims to target the overnight rate which banks lend to one another\nBut you know and interest rates price like any other you don't need the fed for that so I think this notion that the fed serves some useful essential purpose is easy to disapprove we could get rid of it and most wouldn't notice that at all\nIn fact I don't particularly like the fact that they regulate the interest rate that they're not that the federal government views them as a way to when the economy starts to heat up\nThat the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates artificially outside of market forces and say we need to cool it down and in theory there the the folks that when the economy cools down and we don't want it to be too cold\nThat they'd come in and say well we'll drop interest rates artificially to try to pump it back up again I don't like that either even though I'm I'm well aware of the positive effect\nThat has for some people I think it's a terrible I Would rather have the price be like the price of gasoline or the price of oil or the price of any other commodity because really at the end of the day money's just another commodity isn't it\nOh yeah yeah absolutely and and what ... what should be stressed there is the\nIs that the fed can't really alter the price of credit or why do we borrow money we borrow money because it can be exchanged for real resources like trucks tractors computers desk chairs buildings labor most specifically and so it's a reminder that we create the credit we create the resources that\nPeople are looking to borrow and they borrow money and so this idea that the fed can just decree the cost of credit cheap\nIs as silly as the mayor of Portland saying okay the top of mount that you can charge for a apartment rentals in Portland is a hundred dollars a month\nOkay well demand for for those rentals would be high but supply would be non existent the fed can't decree resources cheap so I think even there we give the fed way too much credit this idea that it can eat up the economy and slow it down I don't take very seriously\nIs there an and I don't either because you know all the way through from away when the initial you know we fell off the edge of the cliff\nAnd all the way to June of oh nine when officially the recession was over I like to remind people of that because they want to credit Obama with fixing the uh you know the the recession and I say really\nHe fixed it between January twenty up in the middle of June that's pretty amazing he didn't have time to do anything what did he do exactly and they say well you know he fix the economy well he didn't but their idea was will drop the interest rates low enough to zero or or even below zero so that will pump the economy back up again clearly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo then you know you can only be without an answer John because I uh I'd ... I'd like to get rid of it and I'd like to know what it would take to incentive Ike incentivized Congress or if it serves the function of allowing them a whipping boy loved set them up or\nYou know something that they can beat on every time the economy isn't doing with their constituents one but let's get rid of this thing that serves no purpose and frankly as kind of a disturbing effect on the rest of us [noise]\nUm well look I couldn't agree more uh my second book not to plug it is called elite the fed in which I make a case that the fed is is is rushing toward irrelevance it needs to be shut down but I I add\nIf Congress won't do this markets are shutting down the fed for us they're increasingly making what makes no sense not very well but but I agree with you I think Congress should have the courage\nAnd it is the Germans\nThe German the machine gutters one at a time and slaves um you know over twenty and it is the Germans or realize what's happening they they send about five men after him including one officer\nIn New York is out of ammunition with his rifle and he pulls out his forty five\nPistol and shoots the last man in the row down in the front man and just keeps going and he just knocks them down and you know it's a really remarkable is your story as it sounds so we're leaving fills twenty eight that [noise] but they did about ten years ago they went\nBack to Oregon and they just battlefield archeology on the spot that that you know York made this [noise] this incredible uh stand if you will and they found a forty five\nCartridges over forty of them along with is thirty six ammunition in that exact spot\nAnd and you wrote that as he went you know he told his men because this was the guys you said for mountains in fact there's a great old movie in which he's portrayed and are they talking about what I recommend it oh it's a great movie I was an old movie is not ... if I remember right who was Gary Cooper in black and white ones in it\nIt was and it was Nineteen forty one and it won a number of awards and uh it's really a wonderful movie it's worse now where's that revisiting a you know your listeners out there go watch it again it's a great movie\nSo he's a great strategist as well because you wrote that all the officers were dead so he takes command as a corporal and then when he finishes shooting a bunch of these machine gun ... and the head every time I had come up I'd done knocked it down and he said\nAnd then you said he went right down the position points is forty five at the Germans had and says\nTell your men to stop firing the German blow the whistle on up and down the line all the enemy soldiers stop firing\nJust stopped [noise] they stop and it's a it's incredible they he captures with along with some of the men in his patrol\nA hundred and thirty Germans and they marched them back you know miraculously back to American lines and I wrote a piece of Breitbart on Sunday where the commanding general says\nWell York I hear you catch the whole day observing army [laughter] any sort of lasted obviously I got a few\nI feel a hundred and thirty two and attitude yes this is the kind of story that I Want Americans to remember because you know we're used to go into the movies and seeing you know stories of the single man\nOr a single woman who couldn't run out there and do amazing feeds on his own but this is a guy who actually did it for real and as I recall the story because after I watched the movie and this was a while back a year or two ago I went back and read the history of the real history the man when he came back he was kind of surprised that the I I think the community built um a house\nYou know he was he was not a wealthy guy who was it was not even you know a guy with a lot of money in his pocket but his community was very grateful for what he had done and he got all these offers a you know Hollywood wanted to see him and everything else and and he was just a simple guy was ...\nHe was he didn't want to monetize\nThe experience and I think that that makes him so exceptional\nIt's not you know ... you look at today where people are ... are constantly trying to you know they would create a reality show around this York didn't want that and I think that that's what makes him exceptional along with that generation of Americans which was a hundred years later\nAnd they're largely forgotten but they're going to capture them in the unknowns the book I just wrote in and that's why I wrote\nWell one hundred years later and they're largely forgotten but they're going to capture them in the unknowns the book I just wrote in and that's why I wrote the book I wanted to let the Americans know about this generation and how important it is and how they change the world\nAnd in fact if if if nothing else I guess maybe he was ... didn't they created a weapon system that was the York\nSay the sergeant York the yeah the there's an M. sixteens thing that a couple of anti aircraft guns are attached to it\nBut they called the charge in your car recall that as well now I Want people to see this book can you sketch out in thirty seconds what you've done in the unknowns
