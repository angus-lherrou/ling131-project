U. T. A. [noise]\nWelcome\nBack to Mars Lawrence on the show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Thursday night and on the phone with\nMe right now is Andy McCarthy Andy I Love having you on because of your debt the knowledge as the prosecutor put the blonde shaken prison you know the federal law and I and I we also appreciate the grand jihad how Islam and a lot of sabotage America or you can find what Andy writes a National Review but Andy I Want to get your take on on where\nUh what do you think is driving this bombing attempt if we can call it that none of the bombs went off but they were devices sent to a total of ten different addresses now and uh and use this as you wrote today an example of why no one trusts the media in America\n[noise] well I think was that the abandon with which the media\nGot out in front of what we know about\nThe sensitive which so far is not a whole lot\nUm it was really staggering to me I mean the the the trends Eric determination to try to make this about Trump and even kind of vaguely or not so vaguely suggests the Trump or\nSort of decided this or that his rhetoric um it is so unique and uniquely bad for the country that it might have driven somebody to do this is just really a\nMind boggling\nThe bad for the country that it might have driven somebody to do this is just really a\nMind boggling I'll have a piece coming out on a column coming out on National Review about this\nTonight but you know just when you when you move out of the world of political uh talking points and narrative and soap opera like we deal with and get into the real world of like prosecutions on the court room and a jury common people's common sense\nI'm most normal people understand that nobody\nGoes out and commit mass murder attacks on the basis of anything they hear it a political rally no matter how obnoxious or odious it may be and it really trivializes this kind of terrorists behavior to suggest that it's driven by\nOr something along those lines it's just foolish\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make do say give all of the bombs were sent to people who were you know in one way or another politically oriented toward the left from George Soros to Maxine Waters to the Clinton the Obamas\nAnd to CNN I guess is not a far jump to say well maybe it is politically oriented whereas if it had just been random targets\nAre kind of like the the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski than you might say well we we don't know what's driving him except that apparently hates technology\nYeah well I I'm not at all hesitant about that last I think that we're now\nAt a ripe enough point in what's been learned about the investigation that we can clearly said as a political motivation here yeah um but we would be able to say that whether Donald Trump was president or not and whether he had ever had a single rally or not my my faith\nIs not that you draw a conclusion that something's politically motivated when it obviously is my complaint is that you suggest that the president's guilty of incitement Yup I happen to be one of the few people in America is actually a convicted people or at least one person of incitement\nIn court and I can tell you that it's a very difficult proof in the courtroom as it should be\nBecause we have a strong tradition in this country of of free speech particularly political speech\nUm but you know courtroom proof aside it's just it's it's simply common sense nobody goes to a political rally regardless of how skilled the demagogue\nBoss or you know some other skills speaker at a rally may be and even if that person gets the the the crowd riled up and they say yeah I'm I'm really angry about what those people are doing to us and doing to our country nobody leaves from that to say and because of that I'm going to go now to commit mass murder attack\nWell and maybe they'll decide to go ring the doorbell or something but they're not going to go out and shoot up some\n... or you know a bomb people into a into oblivion oh well\nThere there might even be people who say I went out and punch somebody in the face because I'm so far to go to a political rally but then when you try to turn around and say hand it's not my fault I didn't actually cause the person who riled up cause did\nThat CNN buying into a a kind of I'm not responsible for anything it's the guy who was talking to me and saying words to me who inspired me to do that and I look I Andy I've covered some cases the uh\nUh what was a wide area and resistance case where a Tom Mets gr are inspired people to go out and and be demand adept with baseball bats because he was black uh I\nResistance case where a Tom Mets gr are inspired people to go out and be demand adept with baseball bats because he was black\nUh I I Would buy that you you might be able to do that but as you said it's a very specific case where you say you had to say\nI'm going to tell these people to go and commit these acts because of their angry over somebody's skin color and and they did prove it in that case I Believe and I don't I think that ... that held up on appeal but was CNN as you say all these other news sources saying all of this stuff is Donald Trump's fault\nTwo days after the New York times published a uh uh uh some assassination pornography in the form of a story about the assassination of Donald Trump and then there are calling for unity in and closing the the the divisions between is it's it's rank ... a ...\nYeah I look I I completely agree with that they look lost there's a there's a doctrine of law called fighting words mhm uh which is an exception to the first amendment\nOr it's it's over the years been cut back on an awful lot says the Supreme Court recognized it in Nineteen forty two and there's a lot of good constitutional law experts who think that it's a completely moribund\nA doctrine but what it basically held was that if I say something insulting and insightful to you and your presence\nAnd you know turn around and uh and and clocked me of on account of it um you know I had a minimal expectation of First Amendment protection because I insulted you and I kind of went looking for now again as I say\nI'm the doctor and has been cut back on a lot in recent decades but it's never been the case that that extended to you know you attended a political rally and that you are you know you go away from the rally and you have some distance in terms of time and space\nTo think about it and then you go out and commit an atrocious act and we say it's still it's the fault of the person who's rally you went through that simply it it it essentially says that you have no agency for your own behavior well yeah just ridiculous\nWell Andy I I you know I'm the non lawyer near the lawyer but I've read that case a you know years ago because I thought this is interesting if you walk into a bar and say something so vile to a man about say his girlfriend or his wife that it could be the verbal equivalent of a punch in the in the nose and you might arguably say for something that bad\nYou might you might get away with punching him back for his words but\nBut I think it's a stretch and as you say blaming it on the president or any other politician\nBut I Will tell you that I think I've heard more things coming out of the mouths of Democrats like Eric Holder Maxine Waters Hillary Clinton you know and some other allies like Madonna fantasizing about blowing up the White House\nThat if they want to start going out in identifying people who said let's go out and do violence because of this presidency you're going to find a lot more offenders on the left or then you are on the right the right tends to be pretty\nI don't law abiding I think mostly conservatives are but where do you think there's going to go we got about a minute left in this interview and\nI think they're going to capture the the person or persons behind this pretty quickly large there's an awful lot of forensic evidence that they have and unlike when I investigated these cases Twenty years ago video is now ubiquitous so I I Would think they'll they'll capture this guy in very short order\nShould be interesting because it's awfully tough to route rap those packages and tape without leaving your fingerprint in your DNA all over and of course having a courier deliver them I'm kind of amazed that through the courier service they haven't found something almost\nLeaving your fingerprint junior DNA all over it and of course having a courier deliver them I'm kind of amazed that through the courier service they haven't found something almost immediately I doubt he paid for with a credit card or a track\nNow you've got you've got Christian businesses getting sued into bankruptcy 'cause they won't take part in same sex marriages\nFree political speech the left used to be for that now if what you say make someone feel unsafe the government can step in and arrest you for it and finally how about the idea of academia seeking objective truth and letting a free range of opinions that you know be on campus even if it hurts people's feelings because that's how we find the truth\nNow they're they're silencing free speech on campus on all those things the left walked away from the American consensus and embraced extremist views and now they're screaming at us for being fanatics because we still believe what we did when Ronald Reagan and\nGeorge Bush and Bob Dole and Bill Clinton that Harry Reid all agreed on all these things we didn't walk away they did\nAnd they believed to now let me ask you something since you and I are on the same jogging on just about everything\nYou didn't walk away they did\nAnd they believed and now let me ask you something since you and I are on the same page I think on just about everything every time I've talked to John I'm Talking to John ... from the stream and you've got to read this piece he's written\nUm if we were to try just as hard as you and I could could we come up with any kind of similar ... the list or or something like it I Know you I don't believe in the artificial moral equivalency were let's lift off the ... both sides but\nIf you tried to find out is there anything that the right has walked away from where it was on the same page as the left Thirty years ago\nI Can't think of a single thing honestly now I Know what I'm thinking of saying we're ... we're\nWe're not calling for America to be a monarchy or Christian government we're not calling for people to be put in internment camps\nWere not calling for racial supremacy we're not doing any of the crackpot things that they're accusing us of they're they're just redefining what the American consensus was in Nineteen Ninety six as a patriarchal white supremacist evil heterosexual heterosexuals patriarchy patriarchal monstrosity\nSo the left to move the goalposts out of the stadium and they're calling us lunatics 'cause we're still in the fifty yard line\nNow do you think that some of this the divisions caused by one side walking away from the consensus points\nIs what's causing all of this turmoil lately violence in the streets bombs sent to a bunch of of liberals a political liberals and we don't know how many more may be on the way as are delivered in the mail do you think some of that is because\nWe're we're putting Americans and apply it in a position where the two major political forces in the country\nAh one has walked away from the table and those dozen or so items and and that leads people wondering well then what am I supposed to do a riot when they're no longer consensus\nAlso another item of consensus is when you lose an election you accept it yeah but but the left didn't accept that Obama and I know the two thousand\nEight was supposed to be a permanent fundamental transformation of the country that the election twenty sixteen that was supposed to be a formality like election in East Germany where you just certify with the party has given you when the American people said no we won't take Hillary the Leslie outraged this was supposed to be a permanent irreversible revolution under Obama so they really think\nThat they're under a foreign occupation by foreign enemies that's why they have to have a resistance resistance is what you're doing the Nazis occupy your country not win Ohio votes against you\nWell and I notice that when I was a little kid and you weren't even born John but when Nixon you know said okay I'll concede the race\nThere were folks who said no no we could fight over this winter we could win this one you know because there was probably cheating on both sides there were certainly treating on the Democratic side he said for the good of the country I'll do that I think that's what the left thought was going to happen in two thousand with Gore and Bush and they failed\nAnd that drove them crazy and lately that that sort of\nWe're going to to rush the barricades and they'll they'll simply open the doors for has happened with Kavanaugh when they said well we're going to throw all this stuff down they'll cave in and Republicans have finally grown the spine and said no we're not doing the cave in thing anymore and get over it and I think the Democrats realize\nThis is not going to bode well in the years ahead and probably not two weeks from now either\nThat's right that's right and and I hope all your listeners are going to vote in the national impeachment referendum on November ... because that's what it is\nIs really what it is because we end up with a a Democrat controlled house not even the Senate you know they'll go ahead and tried to impeach Trump even though they don't know that they would get a conviction in the Senate they'll do adjust\nAnd even the Senate you know they'll go ahead and tried to impeach Trump even though they don't know that they would get a conviction and the Senate they'll do it just is just so he could say they ... they can do it and say you\nGot one of Trump's Kavanaugh and the whole cabinet and probably Mike Pence they're going to be complete obstruction is our government or the plot sets of government will come to a halt and we'll be some third world banana republic in chaos for two solid years\nUnfortunately you've got to read this ...

peers Lars Larson [noise] welcome\nBack to the Lars Larson Joe pleasure to be with you on this Thursday night latest developments out of Miami the police and the dogs have been surging a mail processing center there trying to find they believe that that's the processing center where some of the bombs went through that have caused such a stir the last three days in the United\nStates of America are but in other news we've got other things going on and when they catch this dirty dog who sent these bombs and frankly I Want to be caught no matter what's motivating and\nLike last night's Twitter bull he could be a garden variety not could be a foreign actor could be somebody from the left trying to make the left a little more sympathetic heading in the election could be somebody from the right who just doesn't like Soros and Clinton and Obama and waters and the rest of that crowd\nNo matter what the motivation is the person who would send those bombs in the mail is a dirty dog deserves to be caught indicted convicted and put in a deep dark hole probably for the rest of his life\nLos Angeles can barely manage the money for its employees retirement fund which makes their recent ballot measure sound like a joke I'll tell you about it and just a moment more than half the illegal aliens in America were born in Mexico\nSo the latest statement from their ambassador sound a bit like a contradiction I'll tell you about that as well and we've dealt with Bill Frey ears Hillary for decades and now another member of the Clinton Klan is considering politics I think you've already guessed that one\nAnd take a moment to cast a vote in my Twitter pull you'll find a two places Lars Larson dot com and at Lars Larson show should a newspaper published fictional stories about the assassination of President Trump\nAnd this one was specific to Trump it was a story commissioned by the New York times a piece of fiction to be sure written by Zoe sharp\nThat ends with the murder the assassination of President Trump and involves a secret service agent actually handing over his gun to a Russian assassinated killed Trump\nI Know you say that's silly it is silly\nBut for a newspaper that is now begging that America heal the divisions and come back together to be publishing fictional fantasies what I Would call assassination porn because they hate Donald Trump\nAbsolutely out of line and I'd ask you could you ever imagine the New York times asking for somebody to ride a fictional assassination of our previous president I think talking about assassinating any president is just wrong and not to mention the fact that threatening to do it is actually illegal and yesterday's Twitter plaster this\nFor what it's worth I'm Sherry Preston every

seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com\nAnd I told you that we're going to talk about the uh the bombs are weeded expected to talk to a Brian Maloney but apparently he's unavailable tonight let me sure just a bit of what he had to say about\nWhat is coming and whether or not this is the October surprise that we see so frequently from a primarily from left although I looked at looked up the\nAnd whether or not this is the October surprise that we see so frequently from primarily from the left although I looked at looked up the history\nAnd I had to remind myself to run a few October surprises from the Republican side as well\nUm but what he wrote was the discovery of multiple explosive devices addressed a prominent Democrats across the U.S today has the potential to be the kind of October surprise\nThey could up in the mid term elections and maybe even affect the balance of power William Casey campaign manager for Ronald Reagan's Nineteen eighty presidential campaign is said to have ... coined the term in the eighties although there were some earlier than that\nThe concept of an eleventh hour revelation or event that could scramble everything in the month before Americans go to the polls predates the term previous October surprises have happened twenty sixteen Access Hollywood\nTwenty twelve the Romney forty seven percent I didn't agree with Romney about much but I agreed with him about that what he was talking about was the\nForty seven percent of Americans who earn a paycheck and pays zero federal income taxes yeah\nAnd he was criticized for saying those people you know who pay no federal income taxes don't care whether income taxes go up or down in two thousand eight the market crash you know six the representative Mark Foley scandal which\nIf you'll remember fully was a Republican he sent some text messages that were kind of creepy but other than that he didn't break the law and he very quickly resigned his position gotten his car and drove back to Florida as I recall in two thousand for the Osama bin Laden video you know three the California recall election\nAnd in two thousand a really odd one\nBecause apparently even if you fully admit that you've done something wrong\nThe surprise was the October surprise in two thousand was George Bush had a drunk driving ticket when he was in college and he was I think twenty eight years old\nAnd he didn't try to make any excuses he said yeah I did I did get a drunk driving ticket and you know what he decided to do right after that probably the most admirable thing that anybody with a drunk driving chicken can do is say I'm going to quit drinking\nAnd he quit drinking period for the rest of his life and this was a long time later obviously he was running for president in two thousand and he said I'm going to quit I quit drinking right after that ... I was drinking too much and decided to quit the booze\nNow you'd almost think that that kind of answer would get you more plot it's that it would critics but\nThat was one of the October surprise in any case is this the October surprise I guess it will depend on who it ends up is responsible for those bonds\nIf it turns out to be somebody with a Muslim surname I have a feeling that's only going to amp up the president's supporters if it turns out that it's a right wing not somebody who is allied with the conservatives then you're going to get the Democrats doing something really odd and really two faced\nBecause they will say well if this was a conservative than the blame goes to Trump\nWhich is a bit akin to saying well if it's a lefty\nWho commits an assassination or commits a terrible crime then the blame falls on all left days and you understand there is a double standard in the media about that you can cite example after example where the media will say well just because this happened involving one left wing or doesn't mean you blame everyone\nAnd they especially do that if you have an act of terrorism carried out by somebody who's a follower of Islam They say you can't blame all of Islam for the actions of one member of Islam but boy if one person with a gun commits a crime than all gun owners\nA follower of Islam They say you can't blame all of Islam for the actions of one member of Islam but boy if one person with a gun commits a crime than all gun owners are suspect that's the double standard that we routinely see from the left wing media and believe me\nNo matter who they catch and I expect they will catch somebody fairly soon involved with these bombs or devices most some of them were not active bombs at all they were just devices made to look like bombs no matter who it is\nI think the CNN and MSNBC and the New York times the Washington Post will try to find a way to blame it on President Trump let's go to mark and mark welcome to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind tonight\nFlorida in ... years love ya thank you very much shrouded\nNo problem I got I got I got a question and it's becoming a cross my mind for a while with all the rhetoric cholesterol on out inciting violence and won it all to check 'em while they're down yet I go on and on call and say\nThat it ever make you wander it's been making me wonder are they are they ... is the ocean for another civil war I mean they're either all people from other countries\nYou remember the Democrats lost the last civil war ah [laughter]\nAnd and the Republicans won\nAnd thank goodness for that uh but but are they pushing for another and by the way they'll tell you all those weren't the Democrats have today Oh yes they are and we can watch a couple of the national Susan movies and you'll see the evidence and I have to give great credit to punish for being able to do that\nBut do they want another confrontation I think they think\nThat's the only way to remove this president and here's the case I'd make\nThey demanded in September of twenty sixteen Donald Trump you have to say that you will accept the results of the election not demand came from none other than Hillary Clinton\nAnd yet at the same time reporters weren't asking Hillary because they didn't think it was possible Hillary if the election doesn't go your way will you accept the results of the election they never asked the question\nAnd why because nobody nobody in the mainstream media thought it was going to go that way I did I thought it was going to go to Donald Trump and so did a lot of other people and obviously enough Americans voted for him that he won the presidency and they went nuts on the night of November the twenty sixteen they said we can't accept this result\nAnd I've always been proud that I live in a country where there's a peaceful transition of power or it has been up till now\nAnd we said you have an election and no matter whether you like the results are not you accept the new president and if a sitting president gets beat after four years you accept the new president\nAnd if a president served two terms I think at this point Donald Trump is the odds on favorite to serve a second term and that election is still two years away but they went nuts\nAnd they immediately that night and the next morning began saying we have to impeach him and I don't know if you remember this or not\nBut in just staying in December and January the Democrats vowed we will never even let him take office we will find a legal way or some other way to prevent him from even taking the oath of office\nAnd then we got past the inauguration and they burned a few cars the left did you know all the pink hat wearing ladies burned cars and ... you know bright isn't the streets\nAnd I didn't do any good and then they said well we'll get him some other way we'll have him investigated for years on a baseless allegation that somehow he colluded with the Russians were going to get ... I guess some of the results of that from the mall or investigation as soon as we get past the elections and I think the only reason they're not leaking out right now although that ...\nI guess some of the results of that from the mall or investigation as soon as we get past the elections and I think the only reason they're not leaking out right now although that could be the last minute October surprise ... hold it until after the election\nIf you hear stuff starts to leak before the election from a mall or investigation this will prove that point that a lot of us believe\nAnd that is the deep state is at work in America and the deep state has benefited both the left and the right at various times\nIf Mueller's investigation leagues and the parts they leak say he's going to announce after the election that Donald Trump has been involved in some kind of collusion look they've been running a collusion hobby horse for two years more than two years now\nAnd they haven't waited too long well I I don't care if it went ten years but the the real test is and how long it when the real test is have they come up with anything\nLook this tax cuts that the Trump push through last year the majority of it went to wealth\nThat's a said look this tax cuts that the Trump push through last year the majority of it went to wealthy people that's not fair we're going to reverse that I'm\nA ... a hold on to reverse that doctor they'd have to have the house the Senate and the signature on the resolute desk right\nYes um that's what they're going to have a very difficult time doing that are particularly if that the Senate maintains control Republican control and President Trump won't won't sign it but there are some things that the house can do\nA true resolution buy them themselves even if they don't raise\nTaxes uh they're certainly not going to support President Trump's latest plan which says we should I look for another tax cut this one geared a little more toward\nConsumers rather than business the last tax cut the the purpose of it was to increase economic growth and then indeed\nThat that now to increase economic growth we have a capital intensive economy so to increase economic growth you have to create new capital he did that by reducing corporate tax rate from an average of thirty five percent down to Twenty one percent\nAnd he or reduce personal income taxes for everybody including the upper class and the upper classes the one that creates new\nCapitals so the first tax cut was geared\nTo economic growth um there is a feeling that\nUh the higher income people and they did made out better than a middle income people so now Trump is pushing um another middle class tax cut\nIf the Republicans maintain control both houses he's likely to get that if the day he died if the Republicans don't he's not likely to get that\nAnd I think they are a investor community is saying a look all the same as Trump has been doing to stimulate growth which appear to be working\nI don't have a difficult time keeping that up if the house of representative flipped\nDr ... let me ask you why do we need to cool down the economy I understand the concern about inflation\nBut the fan of says gee the economy is doing too well we're growing too fast well water use too fast and can we grow without having too much inflation would a little bit of inflation right now necessarily be a bad thing we we didn't have much inflation\nDuring all of the eight years of Obama before making a briefing on to it would it would it be that bad if we had a little bit of inflation along with a massive amount of road if the fed would stop crunching the economy\n[laughter] you know it's funny I just wrote a column in the hill a few days ago arguing that are exact point\nThe twelve month inflation rate for the last couple of months out higher than Spanish and the two point seven range but it has been inching down a little bit because we've pushed interest rates up new home sales the last five months of death\nExisting home sales have death so I'm there doesn't look to be any inflationary pressures yet and I think the Federal Reserve is over reacting\nTo this similar to what you just\nSaid we can get much higher quote what Ronald Reagan cut taxes in Nineteen eighty one went into effect in Nineteen eighty two\nTruck models his tax cut after Reagan right when Reagan tax cut went in and eighty two in Nineteen eighty four the economy had an annual growth rate of seven and a half percent so fast\nThe two in Nineteen eighty four the economy had an annual growth rate of seven and a half percent\nSo the fact that we're up in the four range and tomorrow the third quarter\nNumber comes out it'll probably be in a high three we're nowhere near at overheated economy the Federal Reserve I I Believe is over reacting to this they should do a little more slowly with interest rates true interest rates are still below historical\nNormal but they've gone up so fast that uh we're having a negative impact on interest a sensitive sectors like housing and automobiles\nSee Dr ... that's the concern I've got is that and I and I'm Wondering let me ask is straight out do you think the fed is reacting only because of the metrics or are they reacting somewhat politically as well to to crush on the economy that is making Donald Trump look like a chance\nI certainly hope it faster ladder I Hope I Hope to try to\nCrush the economy a President Trump appointed a Jerome Powell to be a chairman a so he's got his person in there and always been a little critical of them are lately uh I'm not sure what their motivation is but they don't need to do this\nAs fast as they're they're doing it yeah I'm a ... rates were under four percent there now
