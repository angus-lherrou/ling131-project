called\nOr limiting ISIS or controlling where they could go and sort of geographically a boxing them in a Donald Trump campaigned as a president who would wipe out ISIS the destroyed them uh and and take them out of power obviously not every person who identified with ISIS has gone to this point\nBut ISIS is I guess more gun than we ever thought it would be under a bronco bomb a rich noises is senior editor for news busters\nRidge why use the media keeping Donald Trump's defeat of ISIS in Syria and Iraq like it's a deep dark secret that they need ... need not tell the public about\nWell it's one of the one of the white spots of his presidency I mean you know if you if you look at the evening news you get an unrelenting Lee negative story\nAbout this president mostly about the things he tweets the things he says a sort of a soap opera aspects of all of this if you look at the record you know the economy is very good job growth\nIs very strong unemployed is at a record low and and foreign policy you have ISIS which was headquartered in Iraq and Syria had taken over key cities\nVirtually extinguished in those areas the economy a Porsche this we did a study earlier in the month\nI think that was less than one tenth of one percent of his coverage over the last four months\nAnd this we looked at it for the whole presidency thirty three minutes of coverage of the president's leadership\nIn the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria out of over ten thousand minutes of evening news coverage at a point three three percent it is a positive story but the media are choosing to focus on other things where they can be negative\nIs there anybody you can sort of called them out on this because rich when I was a you know before it became a talk show host I was a reporter and you always look to the best the competition that is the competition told a story you at least told the same story and tried to get them one be further down the road in a story\nAnd and you always tried to find the story that nobody else was telling isn't there anybody in the fake stream media that's willing to break from the pack\nAnd say you guys aren't telling this story but it's a great story\nAnd and then contrast it back to some of the comments simple bomb I still remember when he sat down for an interview with somebody from ABC News\nAnd he was explaining very carefully why it was so hard to hit ISIS where they lived in rock or because it was tough to to get to the target and you know as you explained all the difficulties and about three days later the French for goodness sake went in and bomb the daylights out of Raqqa\nThen remember running the soundbite able bomber explaining how hard it was to get to them and say\nYou know when the French military God Bless them can out do the United states or what the United States president things is capable it really doesn't say good things about your about your capabilities does it\nRight and that's exactly right and I would say one of the it's got extremely little grudging coverage but one of the big differences is President Trump\nChose a policy early on where he decentralized the authority to their commanders in the field you decide what to bomb we're not going to strangle it up and washing the way it was during the Obama administration\nAnd that has helped the or the generals in the field get the success that they have that was\nYou know there was there's been a couple of stories at the very end of twenty Seventeen uh lifting this is one of the bright spots Hans Nichols did a story for NBC\nBut it it really has been\nYou know pushed out of the headlines you know the war is I mean that the Trump part of it is about thirty three minutes the entire a war against Iraq against ISIS in Iraq and Syria including what the Iraqis are doing what other allies are doing the whole state of it a hundred and fifty seven minutes\nIt gets ISIS in Iraq and Syria including what the Iraqis are doing what other allies are doing the whole state of it a hundred and fifty seven minutes of evening news coverage in almost two years this is a this is a very very small percentage of the news coverage they're acting as this thing\nIs a big story you you were talking about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen this was seen as a major problem for the Obama administration now that it's not a problem\nUh thanks to a in ... President Trump and his leadership and his administration they don't want to talk about it I think you know if they're going to be unfair to the guy in badger him over things they should at least be fair at sometimes and and cover the things that are going up pretty well the the record is better than people generally know that it is\nWell and I guess let me make this comparison when Katrina happen\nAnd it was seen as a as a big you know food bar for the Bush administration uh and and the media seem to love to go back and do follow up stories and say well remember when Katrina was handled so badly will here's how they're doing now\nI understand that most news is about things that do happen and then it's harder to cover the house that didn't burn down or the bad thing that didn't happen so they could say well now that ISIS isn't doing as much we're not covering things they're not doing but to some extent what they're not doing is the story\nBut if you wanted to do a story you could go to those regions\nAnd said this was a region that used to be dominated by ISIS with all the bad effects that would have on the local populations and everything else and this is what's going on there now because the Trump Administration has pulled off what Brock Obama\nHad declared to be impossible just a couple of years before and that story is completely doable\nAnd it's actually a very good story and and the media does love to do sort of the good news stories you know you set up a new program to make this happen and look it's happening and you do the happy story that that whatever it was you intended to program and then you have the alternative\nPrograms that were set up to do some good and they didn't do any good but they spend a lot of money and you do that story as well they could do any of those stories right now\nBut I think they're making editorial choices not to because they don't want to make Trump look good\nI think you're right I think I mean CBS has done is put a little more resources into this and the other two than NBC or ABC and I believe they had their correspondence walking in the city of Raqqa in Syria which was the headquarters of ISIS ah they can go there now and walk around and talk to the people who live there and his regime\nI mean that is a very compelling story we got a little little sliver of it uh\nBut you know given the importance of was to to the United states you think we'll be hearing a lot more about it not a lot less\nI Would think so too are there other good examples you run into where\nThe mainstream media is avoiding telling the goods store I just heard today that we're looking to maybe finish out the fourth quarter of this you're economically at four percent GDP\nAnd yet I have yet to see a mainstream news organization New York times or Washington Post the New York times and it pays the salary of Paul Krugman who had declared that anything past the two percent growth rate simply was not possible\nAnd now we may finish out this year with the for the fourth quarter in the four percent range\nAnd I would think that any reporter worth his or her salt would say this was declared impossible a couple of years ago and now it's now it's happening but again that would require the old grey lady the New York times to actually say Trump is pulled off the impossible which I think they're getting tired of writing these days\nYeah there's been incredibly little coverage of that as well I mean looking at you know the tax cuts in particular are given a lot of coverage and negative courage when they were being ...\nWell I mean looking at you know the tax cuts in particular are given a lot of coverage and negative courage when they were being debated well right if they took effect you saw those companies giving a big bonuses to people you saw you've seen companies with higher growth that led to or\nNot dot today or other or in the last couple of days but big gains on Wall street uh and has led to that economic boom so has a uh the deregulation campaign those have gotten just a a few minutes of coverage in this vast sea of of negative news this year uh it's what's what are the unsung success stories that I think needs to be told\nHey rich last thirty seconds what's gonna happen when this caravan reaches the border which I think they'll do before election day how are they going to ... how are they going to cast this one depending on what happens when those those are you know illegal aliens is what they are getting to the border\nWell they're already you know you've got I think every network now has people embedded in this caravan paint painting it is extremely sympathetically\nBut they won't answer the question of what gives them the right to come in a uh to the United states where they you know didn't\nBut when you talk about freezing bank account who's bank account would you like to freeze and what would be your legal\nOr what's the legal reason because you know you've got a bank account I've got a bank account the government can't come in and freeze your bank account without some legal authority and I know a lot of us suspect that there is money that is flowing to this group\nThrough a bunch of cut outs that are probably so thorough I told one of my producers he said well how could that happen I said well let's say George Soros who a lot of us suspect\nSo he's got the tides foundation a private nonprofit foundation\nHe dealt somebody at the ... foundation has already sent money to say some do good or groups in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and Mexico and what what do they do with it day by soccer balls for kids and they buy meals for poor people whatever they do with that they've got money that's already in Mexico\nAnd so one of those groups is gets the word go and take some of the money out and help fund this caravan\nHow do you stop that most of it is likely happening not inside our borders and not in banks that we have anything to do it so how it's easy to say shut them down freeze the account\nBut what mechanism do you use to tell a private nonprofit non governmental organization and NGO in Mexico that has money to help the poor\nThat they can't take money out of their bank account and go down in by meals for some of the seven thousand\nThat are affiliated there isn't any other\nOn your head or foreign would reasonably say what the heck does our plant making wiring harnesses for Ford escapes have to do or whatever it is they're making down there what does that have to do at this ...\nIt it is\nA no no no no no because what you're talking about is your lashing\nOut and saying well let's just heard some American companies and say you could stop the how was Ford Motor company supposed to stop the caravan\nSo that they're gonna lose business they're going to lose if\nYou're just going to you're going to point a financial gun at anybody's had who's within sight were connected to America and you're going to say where make this happen or else well the Mexican government can say Ford Motor company can't tell us what to do the Mexican authorities have\nThe power to do something about this caravan they could simply say we're not going to allow this big group of people\nOr to do this but I don't see\nHow you start then lashing out at every American Company saying you're down there so therefore you're part of the problem\n... hours that's all it could last for days four days or so finally woke up they realize that we're serious the shutdown last three or four or five days\nI felt that I think the president's threat to Mexico is serious and I think he'll probably and put up ... through Twitter or through ... public announcements before then but when you just say start attacking American companies that do business in Mexico\nIt'd be like telling companies that do business in some other foreign company like Germany Germany does something we don't like the\nGel or out of us are shooting at all I Know I Know\nNo I'll tell you what the US government and the military is very good at guarding borders we guard borders as we pointed out last night in Afghanistan we've guarded borders in Iraq\nWe've ... and I think that the United states military is very good at guarding borders they're very good at concertina wire and as far as I'm concerned put a bunch of that on the border and being\nAnd I think that the United states military is very good at guarding borders they're very good at concertina wire and as far as I'm concerned put a bunch of that on the border\nAnd beef up customs and border protection the border patrol and say to them look nobody's coming across this one and two to some extent we're in a good spot now because if they try to come across in one big massive\nGroup there'll be a lot easier to deal with what I Wonder is as they get close to the border\nAre they going to start to spread out I mean if they're one big giant caravan you can probably stop that from coming across the border\nBut if they split up and they started heading for fifty different spots on the U.S border the parts that don't have wall\nAnd don't have a lot of patrols it's going to be coming very difficult to do that a lot of her I'm not disagreeing that we need to do something I'm just suggesting that those things like attacking American companies that do business in Mexico who can reasonably say we have nothing to do with this let's go to Stan Stan welcome to Lars Larson show\nHey Laurie thanks for having me but uh so I think both of you guys are wanting to have leverage against Mexico to kind of forced to hand here and I\nThink we do don't we well we do but I don't think the trade agreement is the thing I think there's something else we can do a ... that might be more effective I think we should post\nI mean obviously like your guest your other guest said the the the army should already be deployed along the border as a warning but I think we should host warships\nAlso thunderous in Ecuador and have them\nPressure Mexico and to returning the\nLaw not a bad idea but again then you're going to have the world and I think is what the Democrats want to

Q. V. H. dot com [noise]\nWelcome\nBack to the Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Tuesday night one of the stories that has\nBeen occupying hard time for the last bit has been the death the murder it appears of ... who has widely been presented as a journalist and use a green card resident of the United states or was\nHe is now apparently dead and was apparently murdered at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, Turkey and the question is well why did that happen and what happened to him and why did he end up dead\nWell a matter of age you're a glue joins me now is a research analyst at the foundation for defense of democracies\nMost to hear a go go up thank you up to hear all do I should say I'm trying to pronounce struck by married to you I appreciate your time thank you very much\nAnd I think he actually if it was quite well I'm I'm working at it in any case what is\nI always had meant to my audience by a dog in the fight on any particular subject whether it's financial or family or otherwise\nIt seems to me that turkey has a vested interest in the outcome of the United states reaction to the murder or ... or can you give us the the pictures you see it from your point of view\nYes absolutely and I think you're exactly right and we have to look at it as a political concern as much as it is a show like it's\nA tricky has all the federal show that I Love ... and ... and if you look at it ... relationship especially for the plaintiff chase falls on the ... eleven and twelve and a site for the offended the old Islam skate fluid at age ... or\n... that was the other side of us on the federal agency telling each other for the cool mom that shocked but he says when he died but I think it's real foul the any any choice it will come from within the first to get in and uh\nThe key when it comes to the middle of the first beginning and a turkey has been very much aligns with a Muslim Brotherhood factions within the middle east since and and those type of a strong of a deep and they're very much enduring ties when we have a Saudi Arabia now especially in the last\nFew years yet funding the the power that it was crowned pit at crown\nPrince a NBS as we as to call them behind the sound much he'd been portraying than ah the Muslim Brotherhood\nAs a hostile a talk show and especially as a as a terrorist organization so we see a major divergence here I Would say even as because of the mother and brother issue a turkey and the and the Saudis are effectively in a Cold War in the middle east\nSo this situation with sick her show gee either the journalists a murder that eat turkey gives\nOn crime on the leverage over at the S. and I think what we're saying is that I don't is trying to put pressure on the U.S administration to distance himself from the from the soggy leadership on this particular issue\nChoked you ... did Saudi Arabia have anything to gain by murdering ... ...\nYou tend to also of course it sounds like what we live in a democracy here in the west they make such a such an actually it's solving sang a magical event I don't know why the Saudis would even take the flu\nBut it looks like a this particular journalist was highly critical of the Saudi monarchy and\nLooking into his prize in Turkey over the last few years it seems like he was getting closer to the Turkish leadership that's also I'm supposed to I don't want to take\nNo I don't want to get too much credit that he was affecting\nYou endorsing and support thing or the Muslim Brotherhood and the and the ... office who was all the problems they they do have more democratically governs the middle east just a ... that's also a problematic looks because we also understand it the Democratic potential\nIs on it but if someone monarchy voters face popularly elected Islamist government's view cushion of he was on that turkey side of the fight\nI mean of course doesn't warrant the Saudis taking any kind of action like this especially from a freedom for journalists as the press a point of view but it looks like they wanted to eliminate that especially crown prince and the effort to eliminate this uh important force\nThat he saw in the journal is he was up to remind our audience a columnist for the Washington Post\nWhich is a pretty influential if you think about it and I think they want it to me this and leave all the way and yes has done really against internal enemies are inside Saudi Arabia as well so I think this is the line with his action but at the end the crown prince of leadership style or\nThe um do you have to give him credit\nBut does that mean that they would have done this thinking we can do this without anyone finding out because they had to know that there would be some blowback\nIf they murdered journalist who was tied to the Washington Post the United states would be called upon to respond as I understand in Turkey lots of journalists over time uh and and I would imagine that they're probably people locked up in Saudi Arabia for a for going past the rules in that country as well any of those don't cause international incidents\nBut most of them don't involve people or or green card residents of the United states\nYes exactly and um and you can also\nBut most of them don't involve people or or green card residents of the United states\nYes exactly and um and even you also know that the journalists had a good connection with you as a as an institution beyond that just the Washington Post I think it's fair to say that he he exiting more than a journalist perhaps it was even an activist I was looking out for U.S interests and I think that helps\nA you know a hype the problem but also turkey has a lot of beef here and the fact that it has this leverage\nEither on a plate his son's quite to out here and the child by by hiking up this issue so in the last\nFew weeks turkey has been steadily leaking information day by day and thereby ensuring that this issue keeps dominate the headlines globally\nAnd memory bought one of the things I understand the paper that had originally claimed in Turkey that they had the audio recording of ... death now says well maybe we don't have the recording so some of the information that was pushed out early to try to get a lot of attention to this that you had this\nMurder happened inside the Saudi embassy that there was audio tape of it\nThat you know it sounded horrific\nAnd then we find out the certain bits and pieces that were pushed out early to get everybody amped up about this story don't exist\nYeah man or a\n... yeah well the problem is nobody has really hurt this take pride and that's what President Trump has been saying that she wants to see the evidence that the Turks are claiming they have that particular newspaper\nThat you mention glad you did mention that because it is a very much owned by the Turkish government that effectively adults propaganda machine and I don't even go as far as to say that that newspaper as well as the largest sources of information we in Turkey um\nYeah and it only carry the message that are pushed by the Turkish government so it's a highly problematic at\nThe only source of information that we have all that you can monitor and the higher ordeal surrounding it is just coming from the Turkish side I didn't look at the newspapers or even a some forces coming from the Turkish government as credible\nIt's very important that as the United nations and you have called for that we need to have some more transparency\nSo I Would like to see all those sources cooperating with the trucks are scenery 'cause we can't really trust that in some\n... to ... I got thirty seconds what's the right thing for the United states to do because one of our best asset to in that region is Saudi and there aren't any good replacement what should the United states do at this point\nIn your life is just hobbies are important right now for the U.S especially with\nThe sanctions that are about to come again on Iran I think the U.S does need cooperation with Saudi Arabia\nWe heard secretary of state Mike Pompeo today say that as Saudi officials and life has been as possible for this or do I get a ... could be a denied he looked at the United states that\nCapable and I've seen some interviews with these people saying oh yeah we're workers will come and work hard well that's not the point if you're trying to escape persecution that would justify refugee or asylum status that's not just people saying I'd like a better job of a better rate of pay that's not going to justify status on the border is it\nThat's exactly right so this is this comes back to the issue of the core issue here and that is right now we've got a problem in our asylum\nProcess are sound system and we've got ... and our laws as you point out especially with children that's making it difficult for us to enforce our laws um right now you've seen a spike in families at the border since the end of the zero tolerance policy I think it's been like Seventy five percent increase that's like a couple of months\nYup and so now everyone knows if you want to get into the United states bring a child as you point out it doesn't even have to be your child just bring a child through and as long as you can hold that Keith together\nFor a little while that shirt together for a little while you get three right now and on our and our immigration courts are first states to seems and because of this loophole we simply cannot remove them fast enough um that's something that Congress needs to change\nWell is there a way to stop this group before they hit American soil because I Know that a lot of people don't appreciate this but if you get your feet on American soil then you're entitled to full constitutional rights if you're stopped short of the border then you don't have any ...\nIf you get your feet on American soil\nThen you're entitled to full constitutional rights if you're stopped short of the border then you don't have any constitutional rights whatsoever so but is there a way to do that the president has threatened to use the military to stop this but it does the military set up two feet south of the Mexican border or three feet north of the Mexican border\nYeah see that's the problem I think the reality is that if you try to use the military first of all there's limitations on what you can even use the military for we have certain laws that prohibit the military from engaging in certain law enforcement access because we don't want the military Kelly used being used for law enforcement\nGuarding a border is the job of the United states military isn't it\nI I agree the problem is is that when you get asylum law and to the issue if these people are supposedly coming across to claim asylum then that's a wallet thing and so that's a law enforcement issue and that's really where the rub comes in and even if you get put that that the military at the order you Dan would have\nTo say okay uh what you'd have to I mean it would have to cover every stretch of the of the of the border and if they got as you point out one foot across the border\nAnd what do you do they couldn't asylum and all of a sudden the military has to bring in ice anyone I think if people are going to come to two thousand or ... how many thousands of miles that is to get here they're just gonna keep on trying until they get a cry\nNow David I Know this is all of a situation where neither one of us has full details but\nThe president early on said to Guatemala and Honduras stop this group or you're going to lose your foreign aid which is something that is within his control I Believe you know the Congress can allocate the money and they have appropriate the money for foreign foreign aid but the president controls how's that dispersed\nOr the president is also said to Mexico you stop this group which they don't appear to be doing right now and if you don't stop them you may just lose that us MCA trade deal\nAnd it's and and it and it appeared I thought at the beginning when the president made that threat by tweet\nA that Mexico was going to take that seriously is that an effective way to get Mexico to intercede and say we've offered a bunch of these people work permits but we will stop them in our country or is it to Mexico's benefit\nTo a ... some it snows at at President Trump and say we're going to let them keep on going you figure out what to do with them on that once they get north or your border\nYeah I mean I think this this is further complicated by the fact that right now you are looking at a incoming you Mexico ... so even if we had a perfect partner in Mexico they were going to exactly what we wanted them to do\nThat's not necessarily the case and you know a couple of months the new incoming Mexican administration has indicated you know less willingness to cooperate with the United States Senate now David out that was that was the campaign so we don't know but still that's not a good sign\nDavid I very much appreciate your expertise that David in Sarah from ah the Heritage Foundation we appreciate it you know if you're like most of us you have a balance on your credit cards

there's there's no end\nTo what they can do if somebody is having reasonable regulations at the EPA hall and then on X Y and Z who knows a day could subpoena records tax records and the lake them uh and I don't just stay in the president's I mean they\nThey say they want to do that of course if there's something wrong you think the I normally\nThose talk right it's a long time ago they've done it to other conservative or and other conservative groups I think they would not hesitate to do it to the president you know they really thought there were some interesting thing there um but they could do it anyway uh so\nOne is the abuse of their subpoena power and so on a you know the Fourth Amendment doesn't mean much if they can subpoena\nSomething and then throw it out to the press or they're certainly going to go for gun control or they will push for massive new spending member when we wanted to begin to rebuild the military after the Obama years they said oh yeah but only if we get a dollar for dollar\nFor welfare spending any Dolly you want to put into national defense we need is another dollar to go on to welfare and that was a deal they drove and McCain agreed to that McCain was the one who was pushing the the defense\nSpending and he doubled the cost of defense spending by paying the bride or extortion a that he thought was necessary to get the national defense spending but that will happen again and again so more spending a it's a death of tax cuts no Democrat\nIn the house or the Senate voted for a tax cut they voted against every tax cut voted for\nEvery tax increase uh including the belly check check trillion trillion trillion dollars in taxes than Obamacare only some of which has been the ... not all of it not even most of the tax increases in Obamacare\nTo all those things are going to happen which makes it doubly important than Republicans turn out in November\nI have to always think could Grover cause I happen to live in a state Washington state that has vote by mail so the ballots are already out in people's hands and in some cases are actually marking the ... for most of the country\nIt's the six of November or that they have to focus on because that is the day you actually go to the polls boy do I wish we still went to the polls but I was thinking about you and your group the other day when his hearing a long discussion on a liberal talk show about Donald Trump and his father and the way that his father figure it out to leave money for his kids\nAnd I remember thinking the Democrats seem to think that it's evil that any parent would try to leave as much of what they can leave after the government's done with them\nOr to their kids and I look at it I heard it and I thought well time I was really admiring the way that to his father figured out ways to make sure that his kids five of them were well ... you know well provided for men that they had a good START I would think that any American parent would say\nI Want to leave my kids whatever I can leave them apparently the Democrats are the liberals don't share that point of view\n[noise] their view is the government will tell organized government to steal money for their kids or the ... I think one of the best things that we know about the United states is this the death tax hits fewer than five percent of people dependent\nThe ... I think one of the best things that we know about the United states is that the death tax hit fewer than five percent of people depending on how you want to measure directly directly hits let anybody people by destroying the jobs are cutting their businesses and farms in out in terms of you know\nYou pay you act you pay the tax made it like a farm that gets cut in half the business it gets cut now everybody who works for it may be in trouble but less than five percent Seventy percent of Americans have consistently set\nOr that they want the death tax Chappelle show Seventy percent so at least sixty five percent of Americans said I don't pay the death tax not likely to pass that fact but I just think it's wrong to tax somebody again and again and again uh on income that they've already paid\nTaxes on at least once and and maybe more than once a depending on how they they are in the dollar a\nThat's a healthy country that is not a country or that Obama's thought he was president I've written by a and they remember on this comment when\nSomebody said well you know why don't you cut the capital gains tax you know whenever we've cut the capital gains tax revenue goes up when we increase the capital gains tax the government actually\nUm gets less money do you really want to raise the capital gains tax even if it\nCosts the government rather they said yes yes it's still the right thing to do show this was not about\nHaving more money to build a bridge or do something constructive this was I Would rather have a tax on success for people to punish them and to hurt them even though I Know it will hurt\nPeople who depend on government spending or you know people who work for the army or are they the legitimate functions of the government or even though it hurt them he still liked the idea\nOf attacks on capital gains show and they was more important than helping them whatever the government's supposed to be doing it helping poor people by the military um all those things that the government says that it does with our lovely money or\nThe American people are not where Obama wise which has consumed by and they and covering other people's stuff I mean and it is one of the seven deadly sins and the Democrats act like it's a political progress\nAs you point out that sixty five Seventy percent of Americans don't like this soon as you say these are people who could very easily say I'll never be as rich or I Would not be so rich or to be able to have to pay the death tax but I don't want anybody else debate either\nSo you're right sixty percent of it maybe sixty five percent of Americans don't have that kind of envy\nAnd Obama's attitude toward money you remember when he said at some point you made enough money\nWell he is at this point the current estimates are that he's worried about forty million dollars he was worth about three million dollars when he came in and into the presidency and here we are two years out of his presidency that was worth forty and the estimates are he'll have made a quarter billion dollars about Fifteen Years in\nDo you suppose anybody is going to remind him of what he said and say so President Obama when you've got to a hundred million was that enough how about a hundred and a quarter you know how 'bout how 'bout to when you got to two hundred million\nAnd you knew that the interest alone and that two hundred million would be about ten million dollars or in earnings on it would be about ten million dollars a year that you would earn for the rest of your life without giving another speech or anything else is that what you meant by enough money and if it isn't enough how much is enough\n[laughter] ... [laughter] losing question I get I guess that's what they clearly is not enough [laughter] uh stuff that it yet\nLose their question I get I guess that's it they clearly not enough [laughter] ah\n[laughter] it yet there is a tremendous sad apocalyptic um color strategy on the left or the day\nAnd the other people's money they and the other people's success or and it's very it's a unfortunate but we can avoid\nThat being the leadership of the country and as you were saying everybody needs to remember this vote\nPlease if it's if it's ... by those take your uh your belt thing to deliver it to the polls mail it to the polls do not leave without people do not\nThrow it away people stopped dumpster diving and that that kind of like they sell those to the local democratic committee Charlie ... both by now it was designed so ...\nWe should all have an agreement that there are certain things that are always going to get built a certain way\nIndividual peculiar to use like building in a while you versus building in Alaska\nBut we should all have an agreement that there are certain things that are always going to build a certain way if we build an education system at where he's not merely bad but as I should it became political and it became full of France and as you said a lot of parents would look at a map\nAnd say in particular and say I have no idea what you're talking about I don't know how to help you with their homework\nYeah you're exactly right and it especially becomes a problem we're talking it's second first and second grade math parents are are are having trouble with it's not even the high school math which is where I my background is high school math and and\nHow do we get rid of that well like you said it it it's politics um it has to come from\nThe bureaucracies from the top because Common Core comes from the top and that's the inherent issue of comedy or is it a top down approach that the education reforms it takes power out of the hands of\nThe experts as you called me um the teachers and it made sure that some powerful bureaucrats at the top level many of them never have stepped foot into a classroom\nOr the ones that are dictating why um students are learning how they are learning it and when they are learning it\nSo I I take an Adam Smith approach to to education um I Believe that competition is is how but schools are going to become better competition for better teachers\nThat's going to increase I'm old learning and and and numbers and that's and turns going to ah bring more tax dollars into a school district that has the schools um standards nationalizing education at first like you said\nOn first glance sounds like a good thing um you know if you're moving from West Virginia to Connecticut you want to believe that your child will fit into the grades that the states as a child should be it but that is just not what is happening unfortunately and ah this is so important because\nNow education has become a political issue and and we have to vote these people in the office that are are going to make sure our kids has the best education and instead of relying on our teachers walked rely politician\nYou know why we got the time tonight city in city out um ... the director of education for the foundation for liberty in American greatness which was fired um why are we teaching kids about the constitution and I know that for some people they can quote ... how does not apply to my kids daily life will the front is\nThe way you interact with your employees someday when you're an employer or as an employee interact with your employer when you're first school where you interact with the police are with the local government a lot of them you have to know the constitutional rights that are guaranteed the documents and what the government wanted to do and what is not allowed to do\nI think to make you you know some trouble daily choices and even choices of the ... we're all going to do it a couple of weeks\nLars you're exactly right and an easy answer to that\nIs that Common Core on measures by English language arts and by math and so the constitution a really it can be used as an English language arts resource but it's more secondary as a\nInstead of a primary historical document that kid should know before they graduate high school\nAnd you know what's so sad about this is the you know we're seeing you look at the millennial generation which I I on the part of and my generation increasingly does not like the country that they that they were born into and ... and ...\nMy generation increasingly does not like the country that they that they were killed and ... and they're constantly it's become a sad to talk about why you don't like this country\nI Believe that it was impossible to have that opinion as as a matter of fact if you noticed pencil you know why the founding fathers\nI set up the constitution the way they did to guarantee that you and I were able to keep our rights as opposed to the government giving us our life and I just ... comments or as because instead of students and teachers and parents dictating how how's that their education as where their kids go oh it's\nIt's their their education and educational rights are coming from that\nThe high level federal your office and um and so and that's a side effect of Common Core is that ... ... and as a result the satisfaction of our country is a crazy things I saw it with my students\n[noise] um I had to get at tell me that you know usa deserves nine eleven um our dog I
