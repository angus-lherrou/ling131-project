I get up and so they know renters\nOpened his health fascinating\nYou know whereas the person is fifty five or sixty which is fine\nThey're out of the pocket of those people that there is somebody that her grandfather ... isn't that right it was somebody who needs a rental tomorrow\nAnd I always try to work backwards and almost every property I bought not all of them but definitely over half of that might have bought the property because I already had the pet it if that makes sense does make sense so somebody calls me and say hey I Want to write a property and I'm like who I can do show your

now a real tour in his early thirties who's been buying investment properties for nearly a decade and essence experience grows he uses that to help his clients both young and old become successful investors themselves\nJoining us now is Philip Becker realtor and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas in two thousand fourteen Philip perceived the prestigious dirty under thirty award from an ER and among his investment properties is one in the U.S\nVirgin Islands [laughter] Phillip welcome to real estate today they travel is David it's great to be here\nWe're delighted you're hearing by the way good choice on where to locate your investment property\nThat's not not a bad place to be beautiful son and Sandy beaches\nExcellent so Philips how old were you when you started investing in real estate\nWell when I bought my first investment property Steven I was twenty four years old wow it was a piece of land outside of San Antonio Texas what I did is I bought the land built a house on it and turned and sold the house and made about eighty thousand dollars profit\nSo Philip you also help your clients invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nOh yeah absolutely especially with novice investors are people that a lot of people think you have to be cash heavy to get into the investment game and you know when I first started I wasn't my first investment was an owner finance deal when I bought that land with just ... percent down and so\nI help a lot of investors especially being younger myself I'm thirty two now but I was twenty three when I got\nInto real estate in two thousand nine\nAnd I have a lot of younger people that are able to help with investments and it's great to show them how you know things like solar financing and even used responsibly financial products such as hard money alone can really help younger people build their portfolio\nI see no one at twenty or thirty something comes to you and says they want to invest and they have no idea how to do it how do you help them\nI think just with every other Clyde it starts with you know a buyer counseling session\nAnd one of the big things I tell my client is don't be afraid to invest outside your market you know even for people that are just getting started especially if there are a little bit low on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why\nI mean being involved with the national association and committee such as the unprofessional network has helped me grow realtors that I trust throughout the country so a lot of times we send our new or investment clients to other markets where we have a great referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become\nThere's how do they tend to pay for these places it does\nKind of range across the gamut but it reminds me of one specific young lady that I help she was about twenty four years old when she came to me\nWinds by her first investment property she did not have amazing income but she had a fantastic credit in her case we did do the hard money route we bought the property for about sixty nine thousand dollars\nAll and we were in for a total of eighty seven and she was able to turn that being a for a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars making of a doubt a thirty thousand dollar profit after closing costs\nOn her first investment which was for her about an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and fill up you just mentioned getting a hard money loan which is a private individual or a private group who fund the mortgage without the requirements than a major national bank would have so tell us how do you find a hard money loans\nWhile they're there actually are lots of different hard money lenders and for the audience out there that's not the only way\nTo accumulate properties outside of the traditional financing there is also portfolio well but as far as the hard money loans it's really just about networking and\nFinding other people that have done it we started group called the broker underground in the San Antonio area and it's been a great resource for over two thousand fulltime agents and brokers that share referrals such as\nHard money lone individual so we've got an entire list of different people as well as feedback from agents good or bad on how\nThe experience was for the consumer and for the agent working with that hard money lenders so again I think networking is is so key for trying to find these individuals that become your business partners and and can help your clients\nFill up that is such great information so let me ask you if someone starts investing in real estate in their twenties what's that going to mean to their life and their financial security in the years ahead\nThere simply ahead of the game you know there's that old Chinese proverb that says the best day to plant a tree was Twenty years ago and the second best day is\nNow with the people that are older you know what I mean for the people that are older it's\nNot too late but those that got started in investing in their twenties there simply ahead of the game and they're going to be able to stop working for money sooner so that their money can start working for them\nNo ice I Love that will fill up I really appreciate you joining us on the show today and sharing your strategies your tactics and new techniques for investing in real estate thank you\nThank you so much even at my pleasure\nAnd all

back to real estate today\nThanks so much for having me back\nWe are so glad you're here so gross is the first of all how business\nIt's fantastic business is always good that's all I can\nSay that's wonderful so Christa your now thirty three years old twelve years ago you bought your first investment property [noise]\nBut I Know that even though you are a real estate investor your heart is really with your clients helping them grow a portfolio that will generate income and wealth overtime\nAbsolutely absolutely I you know I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to invest a young age and given that opportunity the other is really why is that for me\nTo ... when you are young real estate investor get started [noise] first of all how young is young who is your youngest investor cover\nYou know what I actually had a young kid from my home town actually that bought his first home which actually wasn't investment because it needed some work it was a foreclosure that he had found and that he was willing to put the work at it and he had just graduated high school through you're Eighteen\n[laughter] so yes I think he bought\nThe property and like June and he had just graduated in may and his parents help them you know with a little bit of a down payment because it was not something that could be finance throughout the day or anything like that\nBut he got the financing on his own he held a job through high school that show that good enough income to cover the payment and it was crazy by far the youngest\nThat is awesome and so when people come to you and they're very young and they say I Want to invest in real estate what to tell you about the reasons why\nHonestly most young investors are looking to build a stable future which I think it's so encouraging right now because I you know our generation is is really good at\nOnly wanting to do the things that they've fine fine and so I Love the fact that they actually the you know investing in real estate of it sometimes doing ... ... ... and the hard work themselves as something that's a fun activity for them so I it's really encouraging for me\nSo far I Want to invest in real estate in by my very first property am I going to need you know a great credit be really solid reserves like money in the bank and see a really high income or not so much\nWell you know obviously life easier one of those things are are there but it's certainly not something that should stop you from investing actually you know one of my my biggest investors that I've been working with and I first got my licence eleven years now he's built a very impressive ... got\nHundreds of unit the cross the state of Iowa a little bit you know across the border in Illinois and the ...\nAnd he bought his very first property on contract he ended up buying the property on contract from a landlord that was just tired of having every model every time a tenant moved out\nYou know you're paying your carpet things like that plans or rent it out and then felt like you know I put all of this Harvard ... good I think I should probably try to sell it and you know it's sold right away so that's where he got his\nVery first nest egg to start going so he bought his very first investment property on on contract with I think if I remember right it was something like three or four thousand dollars down with the owner financing situation and you just\nBuild from there so it's it's crazy what you can do it a little bit of resourcefulness\nThat is awesome and among your clients are a lot of them young\nYou know what I Will say that you know I feel a pretty diverse client base which I'm very proud of at this point but a lot of my ... the the one that I was just telling you about that I've been working with for over eleven years\nEarly twenties he's now forty nine and had built something that and I can do that or forty nine young especially that they'll let you settled and you know he started in their early twenties and he had the steps and so I Would take good chunk of night that's they're they're definitely what I think they're young\nSo let's look at the big picture a person comes to you in their twenties and they start investing in real estate tell me how is that going to change their life as the years pass\nI'm sure you've heard that the million times in it and they get right contacts on on the show here but the beautiful thing about real estate and you make or lose money only one yourself so if you can buy into something early if you can start building that ... rental especially and how you're kind of paying your mortgage for you and building equity for you\nIf you can do that at a young age the sky's the limit on what you can do because that person that said that that can adapt to that third and that's that is something that you can continuously snowball and run in the\nDown payment option for a bigger and that and you just keep going and it grow exponentially in a way that you would never imagine on paper\nThat is great advice well Chris I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about investing in real estate at a young age thank

trends involving smart speakers\nKnow you might not have an Amazon Echo or the Google Home where the apple home pod but according to an article on slate the data suggest that some day you might\nThey cited a survey from adobe which says in January of this year Eighteen percent of American households owned some type of smart speaker\nBut in the months since then that number has jumped exponentially and now thirty two percent of American households have a smart speaker nearly a third of all American homes and by the end of this year it's estimated that half the homes in America will have a smart speaker\nAnd forty percent of those we'll have more than one\nSo what's everyone doing with their echo their Google Home or their apple home pot\nWell for that there were some really interesting and surprising results okay the number one activity that American Jews with their smart speaker at home according to a survey from Nielsen Ninety percent of the people were smart speakers use them to

estate and your financial security\nUp next let's talk about protecting your investment by making sure kids properly\nMaintained joining us as Tim ... president of the American society of\nHome inspectors as she is the oldest and most respected non profit professional organization of home inspectors in North America and has more than eight thousand members Tim welcome to real estate today\nThank you glad to be here we're delighted to hear So Tim here we are getting into the fall season what should I Do first if I Want to make sure that my home is in tip top shape\nFirst thing I Would do is check your gutters and down stops because the biggest issue with the homeless water and in the fall gutters get clogged up with leaves and other debris and need to make sure that you keep those ... clean the water gets removed away from the house you don't have any moisture intrusion\nYou know that's a really good point okay so the gutters and down spouse bats where to start now what about the windows and doors what am I looking for their Tim\nWhere you want to make sure your windows and doors er Cox concealed properly so the cold air doesn't get into the house [noise] make sure your windows function a lot of times people leave their screens in the windows and wake up people take your screens out storm for the winter because ice and snow and\nSleet and hard cold weather can really take its toll on screen so we suggest people to take their screens out\nSame thing with screen door's takers screen door screen out and put in your storm door\nSo what about the roof now how can I really know if my roof is in trouble or not what do I need a pair of binoculars\nOr you could use that that's true but I Would recommend contracting a qualified roofing contractor have them come out a specter rough they can let you know if there's any damage shingles they can also let you know how long you refer last what the estimated life as but again that's another place of water can get into the home\nIs absolutely right now a lot of us think about getting the air conditioning system service before summer but\nIs that another area that you should have inspected prior to the winner\nAbsolutely a lot of HVAC contractors have maintenance contracts where they charge you a nominal fee if you have both of those checked and so what they do is they come out in the fall and they check your furnace\nAnd they come back out in the spring and check your air conditioner so that's a good thing to do every year and again it's a big safety issue and make sure that friend is functioning properly and efficiently also helps to reduce your heating bills gas or electric\nInteresting another area in the house that I Know is really important especially in the cold weather months is the insulation but Tim how does a homeowner inspect back\nSometimes that's difficult to ... in the walls but at the addict people can get up there\nFish and see how much they have in specific areas of the country\nYou have more insulation or less insulation so if you're up in Minnesota or main you'd probably have more insulation and the addict than you would maybe in in Washington DC or Virginia or the Carolinas 'cause\nThey don't get the cold weather like they do in the north so I Would strongly recommend having an installation contractor come out and expect that of all the investments you can make it a home insulation is one of the best because even though you spend dollars insulating their home you will get that back in the lower air conditioning and heating bills\nInteresting no Tim obviously are shows on all over the United states some parts of the states are going to be warm and sunny all winter long well of course others will be covered with snow so are these fall prep strategies appropriate for your house no matter where it is\nAbsolutely and the fall if you're in a southern climate\nSouth Florida Arizona you may want to have your air conditioner check again because during the summer months it really works hard almost twenty four seven so it's\nBest to do that are both in the spring and fall and and these warm weather climate by having your furnace center air conditioner service in the fall or the winter no matter where you live\nI could say the homeowner money on their utility bills\nThat's very interesting because yes in the southern states people are going into a season in which\nThey're going to continue to need their air conditioning even after this brutally hot summer we just went through that's true very true

based on the quality of life based on\nThank you for joining us America was the last year open phones a AAA eight to five uh five two to five Diane is on Facebook what is a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it [noise]\nWell I line of credit is an approved alone that you take out only when you would want to know where you could get pre approved\nAnd have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\n[noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show or is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe tried to get the other way we want you to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one once you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other ones just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean again a Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product oh truck a Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nUh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing um but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice\nTo lead the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought a drop until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it and um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how're you\nHey they I think my cough Sherman what's up\nI'm going to high school senior I've got about three thousand dollars and then the cat out donating should I in back in New Hampshire and then\nYou're going to college\nThe community college with an H ... program in St Louis and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service the five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges is either a new ad out in the workforce yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nOn crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be an hour or whatever like that okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus\nUm you can invest it ah\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and is a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account\nTo stage a with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal\nFor you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study whether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools and your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward in time for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off\nTeachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our gross take on\nOur dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute we don't have much left over from August coloration so when we said the fans were able to save a lot for a mortgage coloration so is it okay to do that around recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in a ... or you vested in that is that uh uh you choosing an investment for that or is a pension\nAt the ... no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYup okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run through\nIts horribly run state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter] oh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a full nine what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we count as a for then that means we need to put it in ten percent right\nYou got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nI'm you know go do it that that's that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit a thanks for the call appreciate your joining us this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life your seat changing these habits is the foundation of our teachings after smart conferences and I'm excited to announce this fall and\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as
