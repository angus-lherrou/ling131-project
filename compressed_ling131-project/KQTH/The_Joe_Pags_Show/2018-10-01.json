I have a an emergency fund that is\nBrand new uses actually welcome Ramsey show where they\nHad a gift and that just taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nSo um when maybe the tail and me and they have been here thirty ... thirty and ah we just moved from Miami and ... and then ... is cute though but currently trying to sell their house but I'm outside is a house\nOr about Ninety eight thousand dollars in ... I'm\nA ... and our heart that oh so we're ranking our house by trying to sell but we're kind of counting and I like it um\nSo we're trying to sell our car\nThat wear a tie down I ... or so we're not sure how to sell their cars it actually\nAnd that in order to to try to get out of out of that much of your own car number one\nKind of a new one is thirty three thousand dollars what's it worth a well ... that says you know around twenty eight but I finally went and he said he could say\nThat would be a dealer crack dealers don't pay retail for cars they pay wholesale for cars 'cause they reached Solomon retail so it's probably worth about twenty eight if you put it on Craig's list okay what's the second car ...\nThan the second car I'm I'm actually actually exactly 'cause that really wasn't on the table for my faith but [laughter] I mean it's like you know in some way or the training that same range so they'd be like thirty five\nOkay I'm sure that's not on the table for your husband what the crap does that mean you guys were starving\nI'm right into an island somewhere what in fact he gets an allowance\nHey I'm not into an allowance found what in fact he gets an allowance have worked for his check well so what how he's baroque or less than [laughter]\nYou know getting an allowance from work does not make owning a car you can't afford work\nRight there you don't have enough heart sorry go ahead like are is I think ... the ... yeah\nLet it out there that are like kind of what is your household income and so the take home we we cannot buy like about seven out of an edge on\nSo your groceries around nine day in your cars are both absolutely asinine insane they both need to be so that so we don't do it goes on the table\n\nA grown up we'll look at this and say you cannot afford these cars so your husband's gonna have to be a grown up\nOn\nThis is ridiculous I mean now who do you owe them money to on these cars\nSo one is that a lot of them chase that is that correct I think I mean I ... yeah they're not sure either but they're they're bank ...\nOkay is your credit has it survived this debacle\nUm [noise] my probably hasn't by I think have have I think it said if I were not like at Lincoln on anything is there anything that way and then again that every dollar I only got air Claire found that out to eat federal tier clay and count\nWill join in Iran in ... you're going to need to talk to a credit union are small local bank about getting a small secured loan to get both of these cars sold and you're both are going to have to get in some much much less expensive cars like five thousand dollar cars\nAnd get this medical end up because these cars are destroying your life\nWhat they were ... you have a house that that we're trying to found the house is not the issue I'm like I said wow yeah OK\nThe house is not the issue these cars are there as a percentage of your income they're insanity\nI'm ... I'm Serious you you are going you're heading towards the wall you're gonna hit the wall your life is going to disintegrate and you're never going to know what happened if you don't get rid of these cars they were really really really a problem\nI Hope I'm not really unclear because I really want to help you guys\nBut I don't know if I can help your husband it sounds like he's a hard head right now so I've been a hard hit to the problem will be in a hard hit is a cause you hit the wall that much harder\nIf you don't wake up and so the the stuff is ridiculous the out of control you made really really bad decisions with these cars the good news is you can do the decision and you can up and be tight this crap out of your life so you can get your life back think about what if you had no car payments\nJust I'm just thinking about that if you just can swallow that into your spirit right now I mean you guys have probably fourteen hundred and Fifteen hundred dollars and car payments I mean that's just nuts there's no other way to describe it\nSo I'm not picking on you I'm trying to make sure I get through to a ball hard hit over there so everything gets back on the table because it everything going to get on the table and it's going to get off the table because we're selling them if you don't do that I predict years of problems in your future\nAnd I'm right man that is in\nBaton Rouge ... how are you hey day\nProblems in your future and I'm right man that is in Baton Rouge Hi ... how are you\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] um I have a question\nOr my husband I'm fifty seven my husband is sixty\nUm we just built a house I'm second marriage for both others um we've been together for eight years um we have about ... building my husband his retirement is only we had more time and it's eighty five thousand on\nAnd we have a choice with this house that we'd be out to eat it pay\nTwenty two hundred every month Andy finish paying for it in twelve years to pay twelve hundred a month and pay for it in Thirty years\nAnd since the amount that I feel that is in his retirement is\nNot what it should be andme of probably won't live another Thirty years should we focus more on putting that money in his retirement and just pay the lowest amount on the house\nAnd what is your household income\nHousehold income growth is um about a hundred and forty two\nAnd how much does out on the phone\nTo fifty\nOkay right and you really aren't in seven years you're\nGoing to be at retirement age\nYeah you'll have fixed it yeah he's sixty one right now I'm sixty seven and then you'll be sixty five yeah\nI'm I'm actually on disability oriented and I had two surgeries\n[laughter] so how much is in his nest egg eighty five thousand yeah ...\nI don't have one\nSo you have no money All right um you need to be saving Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement household income going into retirement\nAnd you need to be putting everything else that you can squeeze out on this house um and if you cannot get this house on the tenure schedule or less\nI mean you can put it on a Fifteen but if you can't pay on it or it's going to be gone in ten years you built too much how much did you do not want to go into retirement or the house mortgage\nOkay and\nSo I think ... but I think you've built too much house but I'm too much debt on this house what's worse\nTo fifty and you ... where we we just moved here about four months ago you owe to safety and you pay two fifty um you didn't have any equity to put down on it\nOh yeah yeah I'm Sorry I'm it's worth about Seventy eight\nTo put down twenty thousand bucks\n\nNo equipment and now on\nTrack to Seventy eight managed to find a percent down\nOkay All right so he put fifty grand okay yeah fifty that's all you can yes you bought a lot of house for how late\nYou are in life with no money saved so um you're going to have to roll up your sleeves and knock that mortgage out or you're going to have to rethink this house and I doubt since you just bought it and built it and move it into what you're going to rethink I doubt that's going to happen on radio one radio call but um\nYou're gonna you're gonna struggle if you get into retirement\nAnd you've got a two thousand dollar month house payment and you have eight thousand eighty thousand bucks but if you'll say Fifteen Percent of your income for the next seven years while you're attacking this debt I'm you probably can knock it out but it's going to be a tough it's really going to be the only thing you do not gonna be traveling\nUm you probably can knock it out but it's going to be a tough tough\nIt's really going to be the only thing you do\nYou're not going to be traveling the world and you're not going to be by pushes letters on them you're going to be paying off the house [laughter] that helps [laughter] did I rent [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I\nNeed life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance was to replace your income for someone who counts on your show if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and to build up your ... your only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans\nBut I didn't believe it yeah it's a strange concept to you know\nWe told him it wasn't in the budget and you know I didn't believe it\nIs a strange concept to you know pay cash for everything as a lot of people didn't really understand but\nThrough all of this our marriage has become so strong we've worked together we've achieved something I think it's pretty incredible\nUm and I think we were each other's biggest ... cheerleaders I mean people supported us and thought it was a good idea but a lot of people you know they don't like to talk about money or they didn't want a strange and it said it is a foreign concept so I'd say we were each other's cheerleaders\nDo you what do you tell people to key to getting out of that is if they are\nHolding herself accountable mhm um I don't think anyone likes to tell their spouse no but um you know when it comes to money either have it or you don't you can afford it or you can um so if you just keep it simple it's it's easy to do mhm\nAnd I'd say paying attention to your money I'm prior to learning about you\nWe just bought whatever we want we didn't pay attention to if we could afford it or not um but\nWe literally check our bank accounts every single day we use every dollar budget I think that came out the month we got started with this on the top three and a half years ago\nAnd I mean we just pay attention to every penny we spent and I think that is so important to to know what's going on and also I'd say having an idea of what is a want versus what is the need before we started this program I thought everything was in need\nYou know and if my friends had it I saw someone in the ... media that had it that I needed it too and I've I've learned through this process that you really don't need a lot of things right now\nYeah we will often describe things as an age that aren't we are most of us are very few in age we do we do we wait or use that word a lot but we most of us in America we don't have many manage a we have a lot of once but that we call news but you're you're exactly right that's what the identifying that is a big deal\nLike cut out so much um for a while I mean we're really weird we didn't even have a TV for several months and one one family would come to visit and they say All right what what do we do and we gotta we gotta watch some TV than I finally got a cheap one but I mean we just cut out everything oh\nVery cool well you can do
