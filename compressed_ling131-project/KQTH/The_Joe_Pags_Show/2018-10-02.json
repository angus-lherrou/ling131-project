Keith ph Tucson news and talk ... watching VH hey it's\n... don't forget my shows on right after Tucson morning news for now here's moral wars wars on on one oh four one K. shoot ... they say there's always goes or the head of the law lowers\nBill to replace NAFTA you know candidate was the whole down but now we've got Canada on board with Mexico Canada in the United states in a brand new agreement and Andy ... joins me now former C. E. O. C. K. E. restaurants\nAnd port by President Trump's first nominee to head the U.S department of labor the author most recently of the capitalists come back to the Trump boom and the left plot to stop it any good to have you back on the program\nAt great to be or large thank you so I Know people are trying to make a ... an old village people song none of us MCA but or is this a better deal for us the NAFTA was\nThis is a is a much much better deal for us for particularly for American workers than out there was\nA the Mexico part of it is huge for people in the automotive sector by requiring that more more a larger percentage of cars being manufactured in North America to take advantage of the uh the no terror if ah that that a NAFTA used to supply the the\nU. S. M. C. A. now now supplies farmers are going to benefit from it\nA particular up until this concert with a more dairy being able to were not more able to export more dairy into Canada which they'd had big restrictions on that before this even you know the wine growers in in liberal California are going to have an easier time selling wine in British Columbia\nAnd the NFL which hasn't exactly been a big fan of Donald Trump's up to now is that going to be able to sell advertising in Canada which it previously prior to disagreement\nThe NFL could only show ads that it had shown in the United states and Canada so lost a big revenue opportunity that's not going to be gone they're going to be able to make money up there so it's really a benefit for a broad swath of the American business community and in American workers\nSandy we're going to have Molson uh most most of the nail ads running in during NFL games or something along those lines\n... wouldn't surprise me at all I mean if the games are popular up there I'm sure that uh the um the the the products that are most popular with Canadians will not want to buy\nAt space a during NFL games and that's a that's a benefit to the NFL I said this was\nThis was a deal that cut across the political lines are in in Mexico the unions loved the deal and Mexico because it's requiring that I think it's twenty five percent of every car be built by people that are making at least sixteen dollars an hour and it opened up\nThe um opportunities for Mexicans to unionize so this is a I I I you know nobody should be criticizing the steel this as a great deal that it meets a commitment that President Trump made that certainly absolutely shows\nAs many of us have been saying that he wasn't trying to impose tariffs to destroy free trade\nIt was trying to make a make a trade free or by making it fairer and in this deal does\nThat look in the in the ... part of the afternoon of Monday right after the deal's been done they say the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place you'd expect those to go away or at least be substantially modified or is there a reason they're still in place and they didn't go away automatically when this was done\nI I wouldn't be surprised if ah if there were some exceptions made for Canadian steel obviously Canada doesn't doesn't uh pose a national security threat to the United states\nNow there may be some qualifications put in that with respect to whether or not they could sell steal that they imported as opposed to steal their manufacturing in Canada but I I wouldn't be surprised to see that but\nThis agreement does not contemplate that a candidate was in a quarter in negotiating disagreement and uh I think the president got just about everything he wanted a from the Canadians and from the Mexicans as well orange just answering a strong negotiating position something that\nI don't think other presidents either perceived or we're willing to take the risk the political risks of abuse\nIt's just answering a strong negotiating position something that I don't think other presidents either perceived or we're willing to take the risk the political risks of abusing the power they had in these negotiations\nFrom talking to Andy ... who's who was the first a nominee to head the U.S department of labor\nAnd author of the capitalist comeback can you talk at all about the increased intellectual property protections in this 'cause as I understand that's one of those details that may not be as sexy to people ah but but it's tremendously important when it comes to dealing not only with our allies like Mexico and Canada\nBut dealing with some real antagonistic folks like the Chinese\nWell it's it's it it was important to with respect to Mexico and Canada we always want to make sure that our intellectual property is protected as well outside the United states as it is inside the United states but with Canada and Mexico that wasn't as big a problem with Canada and Mexico I think the bigger deal was updating\nA VIP laws when it came to to digital sales are things that have developed since the early Nineteen nineties uh when when after was originally passed with China this is a huge issue China does everything it possibly can to steal American technology I'm done that\nIt's on that for many many years there was a study by an independent commission here in the United states a congressional commission or that determined that they've done everything they can espionage wise and a outright theft wise to seal or intellectual property we did\nThe company I used to run the business in China even a fast food restaurant company like ours to open franchise restaurants in\nAnd say in Shanghai we had to get\nA Chinese partner and you have a partner there they're exposed to everything you know we didn't have big trade secrets that the Chinese would have wanted but any country any company that went in to try and I had to bring in\nA Chinese partners and often was required to disclose intellectual property I'm just to do business in China which is grossly unfair and one of the things that I Am absolutely confident after the election\nOf President Trump will be able to resolve I don't think we're going to see any progress with Europe and China pending the election because there's no upside for China in Europe to negotiate a deal before the election they think the president may may lose some power\nAfter the election if the Republicans are unable to hold the house are unable to hold the Senate and if they canceled either one of them is going to be spending more time arguing with a with the Democrats about impeachment than he is negotiating better trade deals which would be a tragedy for the United states in American workers so I'm hoping Republicans will\nStay in power and then after the election I think will get better trade deals\nYou know you would think Andy this is one of those things that Democrats and Republicans from time to time will say this is a bipartisan issue like national security is bipartisan but the different sides see different solutions to different problems\nWhy do you suppose it is that Republicans are so much more concerned about say protecting things like intellectual property then the Democrats seem to be because it does have an ... dramatic effect on uh on on jobs I remember there was one company that had it's a a software technology for controllers for windmills ripped off\nAnd they had a thousand people working for them in the United states and they almost one out of business so\n... actual property could've built a thousand people in the bricks that that should be something that transcends ideological barriers in the United states shouldn't it\n... it it it should and to some extent it does we had Chuck Schumer um and and Elizabeth Warren both actually I have been somewhat supportive of the president on this and make a warrant told CNN\nThat she thought president from putting terrorists on the table with respect to try and it was a good idea and should be part of the trade policy a short trimmer was very outright but he said China takes total advantage of the United states steel several actual property using\nPart of the trade policy a short trip was very over everybody said China takes total advantage of the United states such deals are electrical properties using ... cyber theft he's\nThe ... they are more aligned with President Trump on this issue than they are with others but I I tell you what I can uh I'd be very surprised if you have to admit anything good to say about anything he negotiates I'm sure they look for whatever vulnerability they could find in the agreement because\nWe're we're to the point where anything that President Trump wants to do even if it's things that show learn worn and other Democrats support they're going to criticize it just because it's President Trump\nA day which is one of the reasons rapping such a hard time moving forward in this country with things that have to go through Congress but the president she should be getting a lot done despite that opposition so I I think we'll see continued progress\nYou know Andy or do you think on an entirely different matter in the last thirty seconds to got are we going to have a nine Supreme Court justice by the end of the week\nI I think we are last year I when I was up for secretary of labor I lost a Collins and Murkowski overdone wanes that life that my former wife at bay did she admitted were not true she it but I still watch them so you never know you never know how those\nIs that there's any credence given to Dr for she has a doctorate\nTwo masters bachelor's degree but she can't remember much oil was crap you know that was required to pass the testing a fraud to get all those degrees you can't remember jak but\nShe really she as she can't or the specifics for the most devastating events she ever had in our lifetime she can't remember how she got there or how she got whole I mean it's like there's a lot of holes in this woman's case that anything I can ever imagine\nI Can't help but feel that I think if you ask the gate ...\nThe series of how she probably was coast going into last everything this find out that this was completely uh scammed by the Democrats\nWhich leads to my second point of why are they not help to civil and criminal criminal penalties force marrying the good name a judge Kaplan I\nWell first of all there is no criminal penalty for smearing somebody that I Know of although I guess you could say the so called hate crimes are an effort to do it at a very low level\nWhere if you use certain kinds of words you could be charged with a crime on the civil side somebody could suit Dianne Feinstein or Feinstein is the president likes to color or they could sewer for defamation the problem is\nWhen you're suing somebody who's a a public figure and if you happen to be a public figure as well and I think that Christine forwarded this point would be judged a public figure it becomes exceedingly hard to bring any kind of lawsuit you'd have to prove\nThat a sort of Brett Kavanaugh one or to bring a suit against Dianne Feinstein he'd have to prove\nThat what she said was on true number one number two that she knew it was untrue when she said because he is a public figure and number three the jihad actual malice that she said I'm going to get this guy with even if I have to lie about it and I'm going to say things that are on true\nAnd I think you'd also lose out because\nIn most defamation law that I'm aware of because as a reporter I've had to deal with lawyers for for like Thirty years\nOn defamation laws when it comes to a public figure you have to show that you've actually suffered some dollar damages not just that you lost out on being a Supreme Court member which you know usually pays less than what the private sector would\nYou I don't think you'd be able to show dollar damages you wouldn't be able to prove that she knew it was untrue when she said it uh and in fact how would you even go about saying that what Christine Ford\nIs proven bully on true and and that means provable in court by a preponderance of the evidence first of all one of the biggest problems is proving something didn't happen\nBecause you know I could I could say to you I could prove\nVarious things that I Do but how do I proved the things I never did or disprove the idea that I did them that that it's hard in almost all cases so they're almost used in a civil or criminal solution to that and so and the Democrats know that they're using it to full advantage\nLet's go to Debbie Debbie welcome to the Lars Larson Joe what's on your mind\n[noise] hey Laurie I'm I just wanted to talk about\nAh the um I can and I guess my main concern is that um people are saying that he's not fit to be on the court because of his demeanor and uh I think that is so wrong because they are dealing with some personal I'm a attacks\nOn him to personally and of course he should be angry especially if they're untrue who wouldn't stick out for themselves when you have patently false statements and found that the call\nOf course he should be angry especially if they're untrue who wouldn't stick up for themselves when you have patently\nFalse statements in front of the whole country set about use less awful things and uh but there is no way that ... but I think he was very right just stick up for himself if you don't do wheel\nAnd he had to be emphatic about it because he had ten people on the other side they couldn't say I'm not a couldn't say this guy was yellow or blue if it was\nA if they couldn't tell the truth it their life depended on it and so he had to have a strong defense I mean gee that he's a lawyer he's a judge I mean that's that\nBodes well in his defense but I'm telling you that if he if he gets on the court I just from looking at him I think if they're honest I think he dedicated to his profession or he wouldn't be where he is\nI think ... was the fact that he says this never happened but you out a way I Want to know that if you wanted to do what they call arguing in the alternative were just some defense attorneys do where you say but if it were true that I did this thing in high school when it happened one time and never happened again\nHow many of us would like to be judged professionally for one thing that happened one time Thirty years ago or ... something like this I think most people would say by that standard probably like the president suggested today he says he knows a bunch\nOf people on Capitol Hill from the Democratic party who are dirty themselves and not for things they did in high school for things they've done since they got into public

culture folds allegations and attacks on due process not to mention title nine Michele welcome back to the program\nThanks for having me\nSo what is victim culture doing to America\nWell pretty much ruining it I mean you know you only have to look at what's going on with judge cabinet that the that um but the the we've created a victim culture where it is a an honor to be a victim it's something to be tried all about\nIs something that says about and it's causing a lot of problems because\nWhen you're a victim you get a pass on everything you you don't have responsibility for whatever you ... you know and I did that great on the class because still in the ... you know on a victim so it's it's causing a big problem and a lot of ways um and creating a whole generation of women\nSo it's it's causing a big problem and a lot of ways um and creating a whole generation of women do save themselves as victims is no one idea as a as a good thing\nI agree with you in fact we see people complimented on their courage for bringing a charged forward I Would imagine that\nYou know to the extent that Christine Ford believes what she said under oath last week let's assume she actually believes it whether it's true or not is another matter that she was you know she was congratulated on her courage for bringing forward she knew that you would face a certain amount of\nPublic or I guess negative reaction but you would also get an awful lot of a positive reaction to not to mention some of the financial rewards that have already begun begun to roll in in the form of about I think at last count about eight hundred thousand dollars and we'll go fund me account so there are negatives but there are positives as well\nBut she's congratulated because she had the courage to say something about it she says this has trouble there for more than a third of the century\nAnd these other two accusers uh Debbie Ramirez who doesn't entirely remember what exactly what happened at Yale University and then we have Julie sweat Nick ... apparently didn't NBC interview today in which he began to back off of\nSome of the claims that she had made she had said that\nYou know bread cabin on mark judge had spiked the punch to ah intoxicated young women children really\nAnd and to take sexual advantage of them will she's now backed off of that saying merely she saw cabinet off by the punch bowl which I don't think is exactly an indictment but I mean literally she said\nWell when asked by NBC News Monday whether she saw Kavanaugh's slip substances into drinks which is what she said that was recently as last week sweating ... only witness to him by the punch well\nIf you say why is that a big deal if the FBI has been out to have a chat with her if she told a lie to the FBI that's criminally punishable so I'm Wondering if maybe that's the reason that her story is changing just a week later\n[noise] well I Wonder a lot about that and take politics out of it completely because I'm not looking at it I I Do title nine representation I represent nails are falsely accused of sexual assault every day that's what I Do so I see that when I look at it I\nDon't see a political issue I see exactly what\nIs happening to the students I represent every day somebody makes a statement and they're the hero and they're the victim and the one with the courage to come forward and being a rape victim these days is an honor it's that bad you know where\nIt's become that trend and it's really really concerning because first\nOf all it destroys so many lives of the ones they're accusing and what they're calling rate is no longer a the ... that's an issue of rape that we used to have in the criminal definition it's changed completely\nAnd they're taking away all the due process concern so it's just that the whole idea of it is fairly ridiculous and you know there's there's a pride that goes with his victim then ... and I think that's part of what is is\nSpring it um it it's kind of silent pride that you know I'm a victim and therefore whatever I've done is grew up in my life is not my fault it is not my responsibility as someone else's it because they did that to me it is not on me\nYou know all the problems that I've had any fault you can't throw it back on me\nBecause they did that to me it is not on me you know all the problems that I've had any fault you can't throw it back on me because it's not my fault out of victims\nYou know Michelle it sounds like you're telling me for the last Twenty years 'cause I remember Twenty years ago saying to a producer who happened to be a young lady I said to her I said I Need to find my victim status today and she said what do you mean I said it seems that everybody who is a victim\nHas status that that ordinary human beings do not have and she said well where would you find it and I said well\nLet's see when I was ten my mom was killed by a drunk driver I was in the car and I dragged her body out from under the car when my my father and I managed to get her out from under the car\nAnd I said so by that standard I should have been a victim status that I can get away with just about anything except that I I never thought of that as a way of saying well if I if I yell at one of my co workers I can say well you know my mom died when I was ten or if I drink too much alcohol I can say well my mom died when I was ten in other words\nEvery single thing I might do that somebody might object to I can say it's because my mom died when I was ten I think my mom would reach down from heaven and slapped me upside the head if I did something like that because I Do\nBecause I mean I'm also a therapist and and I say that just to turn it back up to that to say but in you know you go through life and the goal is not the victim as being a victim\nDoes it does your emotional grass and your gross as a\nPerson and what you're going to do in your life and and it he's your relationship everything so the goal is to not be the victim and can help people recognize when they're being the victim and it's now out of it you know you don't really\nThat's not really a real snap out of it that seriously they kind of open your eyes and say that being a victim is not helping you it is hurting you it's and now we have this group of women that are coming along and they're taking\nTaking with that but it's what they want to be as a victim I mean I've never seen anything like it it's really bizarre it's ... it's like a cult it's such a victim cults\nAnd unfortunately as you pointed out when somebody begins to say if I don't perform as well at work or I Need to take more sick days where I couldn't finish my college degree is not because I wasn't studious enough\nIt's because I'm a victim as opposed to saying you know and and we're all proud to those people who came back from World war two the greatest generation and they saw horrific things that make most of what America sees as horrific you know pale by comparison and then come back\nAnd cry and their beer they came back and build the modern America that we live in today so I get a little irritated at people who say well everything about me is is defined by my victim hood Michelle keep up the good work do you have a job a website real quick\nWell friends is one of the quotes that stuck out at me and this is why\nI maybe I should have been watching Saturday Night live I was up past midnight on the west coast on Saturday Night I just didn't watch it I had to hear about it the next day but he said quote you know it's like the plant the Democrats plan to take fathers out of the home and promote welfare does anybody know about that that's the Democratic plan\nAnd I thought I think he's right it's the same kind of thing I've said that you're really playing a trick on a whole generation or two when you say to young ladies if you have a baby you can have a ... as long as you don't get married and and provide a father for that trial of yours the government will send you a check\nAnd that just incentivize is marriage and cohesive families um\nThe w._b. ... boys uh you know back back in the day was a guy who pointed out that you you had a largely intact black family structure in the early part of the Nineteen hundreds Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen twenty or thirty and it was largely intact\nAnd then in the sixties came along and the great society under Lyndon Johnson and they dismantled all of that I think for political reasons under John ...\nA lot of these policies have been in place for so long these policies these some Lyndon Johnson is is that he's going to have the ... or its voting a Democrat for the rest of the for the rest of the lives that have these are the things that that that that the left is not a black\nA black people on the left on looking at that not that no one is educating them that you have an doctor in the colleges were there and doctoring where they're pushing all of the Democrat policies but then you have\nYou know people who are ... degeneration of ... of all my parents' voted Democrat my grandparents all Democrats to vote Democrat and what happens is Kanye West is saying they are not as a matter of she'll have to vote what your parents that you don't have to go for what people for what a for what they do at the ...\nNow if you don't have to vote what your parents will that you don't have to go for what people for what a for what they do as a society says you must go you can be an individual use your heart liberal school what your heart both ... with your heart says don't just vote because it's popular vote Democrat\nAnd actually I think it'd be great if every group of voters instead of voting based on as you say skin color age or gender or whatever if every group played a little bit hard to get so if I'm going to vote for you the Democrat or you the Republican what are you going to do to make my family and my country better off\nAnd whichever party gives you the you know the the kind of policy that will actually produced that result you vote for them and he voted along for a couple of cycles and they don't deliver you say hey I voted for you you didn't deliver I'm going somewhere else\nOr large my organization currently is what we're doing a national\nDay of action for black conservatives all around the country but one thing that we're doing is we're telling people is to make politicians work for your vote and I guarantee once we start when it's that starts to sit in the Democrats will not no longer have the power back because they haven't done anything I was in Chicago and I was met with people [noise] um\nI met with representative John Ford and some other individual I said well our representatives only ... the fault our ultimate aren't answered the phone I said because that's because they already have your vote because you've already given to them you won't voting thing they'll send you have been married to them and so they say that they don't have to work for like a marriage it's like a marriage when you had that honeymoon period and then\nAdded a honeymoon period they distribute they just do whatever they want to do because you're not going to get a divorce yes how it is\nAnd and you know what the onto that applies to men and women look I my wife does not take me for granted and I don't take her for granted we've been together for almost twenty five years and married for almost twenty three years now but we understand the minute you start to take the other one for granted\nYou're really you're you're casting them the worst kind of insult you can throw them which is pure here you're going to stick around I don't have to work hard and and my work hard I mean what can I Do today that will be good for my wife and good for my family and if she she should be thinking the same kind of thing\nI agree and that's the problem and so we have to change that we have to do it we have there has to be a new order best as Republican probably we have to simplify\nA message and we have to make sure that we're going into communities where Democrats aren't because they figure they don't have to call a we have to go into these communities and we have to share the Republican message that's why the black and some of the federation for promoting economic stability\nEducational advancement in community involving three Republican principles in the African American community\nAnd we are pushing the conservative message\nI ... I Know people can Google it a black conservative federation what's the website for the group\nYou can visit us at B. C.

S. M. C. A.\nThat includes both Canada and Mexico has this way of approaching trade deals by saying we will use tariffs if we have to to get our trade partners back to the table and negotiate a better deal for America has this worked out the way Donald Trump said it was going to work out\nQuite I have to say because you know like is that there's absolutely no doubt that there's a big relief\nUh from investors and the market and uh and everyone honestly about the agreement that was a that was and now a late last night but that is because it took us off the blink of an edge that was created by the chaos\nA of Mrs Trump so the one overwhelming benefit is that now we have a deal but the only reason why we were um you may not having ideas because Mr Trump said he was going to withdraw as for a lower terrorists learn really not getting any of this because the metal terrorists\nAre still on and neither do we tell your story there have from Mexico and Canada are still on and on the state of concession the Kennedy I did on very\nUm they're they're pretty minor I think we have to remember what if we're talking about terrorists the the we have to remember what we had under NAFTA under NAFTA owe us export we're going to Mexico you have free\nAll non ag exports\nFrom ... us we're going to Canada duty free and Ninety seven percent of the value of I exports we're going to Canada duty free and so yes they were so stubborn like the dairy dairy\nI'm I'm a\nParis and they and they were about they were mostly bad for Canadian consumers\nFor some of our industries dairy for example you mentioned we got concessions from Canada would we have been able to get those any other way\nYes that's so you're you're saying that basically yes for a dairy producers let's not forget we have a massive trade surplus when it comes to dairy Canada so they were already you know uh\nAs far as American farmers are doing really great under NAFTA and uh and and but so a few very foreigners will be able to have more access to the\nTo the to the market a market that they had a fairly good access to in the past but Canadian consumers\nAre going to be ripping off really about it because the prices for them is going down\nQuite you know quite importantly\nShows their prices will go down but more American farmers will be able to sell their products into Canada we heard famously about the two hundred and Seventy percent ... there were being charge on American goods that meant that an American farmer who's costs are probably relatively the same as a Canadian farmer\nYes to own cows he's got to have a quick minute buildings and he's got to feed the cows that did his products had to be sold at maybe one third the cost in Canada to be able to compete with the locally produced milk cheese\nThe good whose products are to be sold it may be one third the cost in Canada to be able to compete with the locally produced milk cheese butter all the rest of that and\nAnd yet we had we had a massive trade surplus and dairy with Canada\nAnd then we ... we shouldn't be getting the impression that because our consumers in Canada or how we're going to have to pay a really much higher price um than uh because of the terrorists than they would otherwise they weren't buying a ton of dairy\nFrom from from the U.S they were and it's and it's because you know the the way\nThe Canadian suddenly the work is very different than ours it's like it's it's a lot of quotas on how much that can produce so much higher prices and things like this so um it's it it's a different system and that's one where even\nOf the the import tax imposed by Canada Canadian it was still in their interest to buy a lot of dairies from the U.S that said I think it's a very good thing\nIt's a good thing for the farmers will sell more it's a great thing for Canadian consumers but it's also worth putting it in perspective that terrorist although we're not an issue\nWith NAFTA because most terrorists were a zero most exports ah with this one example\nWhere we're actually at zero if their problem was trade barriers they're mostly find found and regulation than other things and and I don't know that we're getting a good deal on auto because um it's going to lead\nTo higher prices of automobile now\nYou know if you think that um the maybe some of the small benefits to union\nWorkers is is a good thing and then you'll think it's a good thing if you're a consumer of cars in the U.S it's it's not a good thing but again it could have been much worse and and and and it's a deal\nThat people will learn to live with I don't think we should expect expect massive changes in employment I don't think we should ... ... uh expect massive jobs to come back to the U.S because a lot of the lost his job and manufacturing started in Nineteen fifty is due to automation but\nIt's better to have a deal than not do you have a deal and it could have been much worse\nWell let me ask you about some specific so I watch the president this morning talking about the deal and I've I've done some other research on one because we don't I mean some of the particulars we don't have publicly yet\nBut they said that more car and truck porch will be made in North America and that that is a boost from the old NAFTA and forty percent of the work on a car or truck we'll have to be done by workers making at least sixteen dollars an hour and they said that and obviously this\nAny trade deal has to be a winner not just for people buying and selling things were making things but also for people who are employed in the manufacturing things\nIf there is a minimum requirement that forty percent of the part of the work on a car has to be done by people had sixteen bucks an hour that is for the most part Canadian or American workers and probably not Mexican or Asian workers' rights\nThat that is true but it doesn't mean that actually they will that the supply that first let's let's first say that\nUm it's not as if we're going from a system where they will no requirement to a system that now has all these requirements on neighbor or certainly it is but I'm actually quite surprised but you actually find that\nA good to impose increasing the court costs of labor or because if the Democrats were asking for an increase of the minimum wage you're sixteen percent you will understand that this is a great distortion to the American labor market and\nThere there might crowds were asking for an increase of the minimum wage you're sixteen percent you will understand that this is a great distortion to the American labor market and it's not a good thing\nBut now let's let's just say that that are under the deal as written especially considering the protection for a Canadian and the Mexican from potential ... in the future it is very possible that this these requirement of a\nA higher wages and also of a more sourcing in Canada Mexico\nAnd um and and the U.S of auto parts will just means that automakers are going to not case their supply chain but instead well decide to face a two point five percent care that the U.S has in place is going to get him they depend on their\nOn their on their own you know business model right and there's not going to be a one size fit all but it is the assuming that everyone will change their supply chain and I think it is wrong\nRemember things differently each are have been affected differently through this year\nBut um we we have continued to move on we we go to country music outdoor festival all year long we continued to do it we've been back to Vegas we we're not going to stop living\nBut it's still in the back of your\nOh it's your store the for until just a few weeks ago I was still afraid of my own shadow loud noises we can't stand to Terry and I are really affected by failing claustrophobic if we're somewhere and you can't and it feels like you can't get away\nWe just we can't we we choose the moves location we you know and you don't sign on an airplane and I'm a traveler it was really really tough for me this last year because when they shut those doors if something happens you can't get out what are you going to do we're going to go\nAnd almost sounds like more a little more your your your ring the bells testimony for what we always yours the you know to be advised folks will we get from some other folks who talk about these things is when you walk into any place doesn't matter where it is more creative ways to get out before you happen to not left\nAnd my father my father was always an advocate of that growing up I mean he he taught us to be\nVery aware of our surroundings\nAt all times and you know I think I think that really helped and again my husband kept the cool head and we just followed his follow his lead\nAnd um but we were we were some of the very last group to leave we were there during the entire gunfire\nOr your husband do some good advice do man retrospect to go down again don't yes\nYes and then again there were just\nRandom people who were who saved us\nYou know there were two police officers on the other side of the rail\nThey'd been there all all evening long just standard protocol a concert you know you have off duty or you know you have often or is that are here to come and my instinct was I got down I Do it my husband told us to do but I Want to do with that real I wanted to\nGet behind them because it felt like safety to me to be\nIn between kind of a structure and at least be behind police officers had weapons Marlon in other\nOf the ... have you stayed
