thousand about five years back I mean you know we're we're doing pretty good I mean wages are going up\nBut you know the the the thing about the the dams as they invested in identity politics which

they they do not have a clue I mean I I feel sorry for ordinary Americans in a you know who who are misled into voting for these guys\nYou don't miss dramatically you just said something that made me think uh from time to time I'm Talking to folks and you follow politics closely so do I and sometimes we're used terminology ... that seems a little opaque or to folks and I've had people ask me about various terms in one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that\nFrom my audience the way you see it\nWhile it's it's hard to hear from them as um you know you start by saying what's their race what their gender and so on and uh and and you know and then if you're the wrong race or the wrong gender that does to your your your\nThere they're not terribly interested in you but mostly\nYou know it means that they're obsessed with you know trivial concerns like transgender bathrooms\nBicycle lanes I mean concerns that played to the elite of the country\nI mean it's only people are really rich are going to worry about that stuff okay it's it's not the the coal mine are looking for a job right know without the oil worker who's who's worried about about you know what regulations are doing to the economy so you know they they've gotten\nInvested in frivolous concerns of the people who got you know made it\nAnd made me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank Frank ... who's at George Mason University School the school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed\nI I think you've spoken to some of these really important because\nWhen you becoming a lead in other words most of the people that you have daily contact with our people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money nobody's saying I Wonder if I make the house painted this month of the car payment or can we really afford to take a vacation this year\nThese are people in an entirely different class and so like you say your your concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily and then but you have to build in or out in pretend\nThat you care about that coal miner who's being who Hillary Clinton famously promise to put out of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job for a new running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county in Kentucky Harlan County that sacred ground to the left this is where the the series justified is said and it's where\nThere was this big old union battle back in the Nineteen thirties and you know Pete Seeger had this song which side are you on and I I you know I thought this is great you know I Know which side the elite is on its author coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump\nSo you know but you know talking about the elite that look or you know I Confess I'm living inside the beltway I'm a lawyer you know but then I aspire to be a traitor to my class 'cause\nI thought these relatives who are working on the assembly line than Detroit\nAnd I figure if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about in the wall Street Journal recently uh was telephone justice\nBut ... well it's you know I was making a point about the corruption of the rule of law and the way it works Russia is before a judge reaches a verdict phone up the you know the party boss the communist days you'd say what should I Do right so the ... you know using the telephone to determine what was going to be the result\nAnd I said you know in America we've got a somewhat similar problem they have to go to the law and Russia we got too much but here we gotta we gotta search going on for the great Trump descendants and and you know mostly it is just kind of ordinary strollers like Mike Flynn who committed the crime of\nThe line for the FBI when he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause I don't understand why he with his background didn't just assume whatever I talk to the right to tell the Russian ambassador\nIs going to be recorded by five different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI does it say can we talk to you about your conversation you should assume that they already have every ... and ... from your conversation and they may be trying to move your into up into a process crime\nOr you know we're we're we're trusting people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement of the FBI ... most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask when\nAnd and you know sadly where we are in the country is that is the wrong thing to do\nMaybe we should I mean I hate said Frank 'cause I've had friends who were FBI agent Secret Service agents\nCops sheriff's deputies you hate to start acting like when the police show up for the FBI shows have you say I should treat them like a treat the G argue if I was a a a an an occupation of of Russia or the old Soviet Union his book is called the Republican workers' party\nWell the person who decides whether or not a particular man or woman is the person for the job is the president the Senate can say this president you've nominated a thoroughly unqualified candidate we reject him or her\nBut in this case they had to admit that Brett Kavanaugh was ... was a a fully qualified candidate\nSo their job was to simply affirmed that and put them on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one Democrat voting the right way now I mentioned this\nLittle uh it was amazing to watch this president Donald Trump sitting behind a resolute desk in the oval office today and Kanye West sitting across the desk for him\nAnd Donald Trump listing for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes now I'm not going to play all of it but I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is Kanye West and I know the standard line from the left is what this man is crazy now why did they think he's crazy because he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy well I'm find to be put I'm I'm okay with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit of ...\nA I have a conversation that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of people say you know first of all the ... a lot of jobs as the father of the job and they say we're getting more money for has more\nOff and then we got rid of the mental\nHealth issues in the eighties and then I and the previous just shot a\nShot right which is actually far harder it's going down when\nHe mentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and inept Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on the problem we saw\nSo uh I think it's the way\nThat she feels that game\n\nGives you power in a way he's talking about the hat\nThat does keep America great or keep America great twenty twenty or make America great Donald Trump's campaign slogan and he's saying this how gives you power and\nWhy you know my dad\nAnd my mom's side has a lot a male heir she came home\nAnd also a marriage that are\nDoing that even\nYou know and [noise] you know\nMain guy they get all the time like\nThat was it was something that is how it made me feel like Superman made a super hot there\nDoing that by putting that had on he becomes a superhero [noise] I Know that a lot of the left who said this man it's crazy and yet you know all of what he just said\nDo you do you find anything to object to he says he grew up without a male figure in his life and that that damaged him he said that an awful lot of young men end up on welfare and they effectively said to young women\nHave more kids and we'll send you more money and that that's damaging as well and none of that ... that is all Republican orthodoxy it's it's conservative orthodoxy to say the\nPrograms that are supposed to help people often end up damaging them and you\nTo me like I said look you look\nAmerica I Know what at that point I didn't believe that one out but I made sure it didn't hit the air if you're listening on stream yes he did use a couple of swear words and that was one I miss but I I dropped out one out because yeah he was sitting in the oval office\nKanye West managed to drop a couple of swear words\nBut his message was all conservative and this is what's driving the left nuts they can't stand the idea that a man who is both black\nAmerican and successful is sitting there in front of the president of the United states saying I admire what you've done I support what you've done I'm warned that his hat it turns me into Superman and what in the world is wrong with that glad to have you with me at eight\nSix six four three nine five to seven seven\nAnd we're talking about intellectual property rights again see ... going to join me next and you're listening to Lars Larson show [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] ... does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for police\nAnything close to the restaurant\nMiddle seat with beef stomach problem that my fear of flying [noise]\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with a digestive condition called X Okrent pancreatic insufficient ... or ... even if you don't know when he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBloating stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still have a PIN because not everybody experiences E. pi on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable so don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ...

and I always promised to tell you if I have a dog in the fight so I have a dog in this fight because I occasionally by things on Amazon and I find that kind of convenient but his Amazon getting so big that it could literally threaten our economy\nWell Michael ... joins me now CEO of the cyber education foundation and founder of the justice society he's also the author of the devil inside the beltway which we've talked about before Michael welcome back to the program\nTo get it back with you there I'm doing very well so [noise] I like\nAmazon I Do business with them but I still do business with bricks and mortar stores a lot of other companies why do we now see Amazon is something so big it literally threatens our economy\nBecause the little baby tigers are cute and when they get around that kill ya okay at it [laughter] I'd rather for ... ... s and and conspiracy theory Thursday step either I'm really by and and so I you know look\nIsn't it interesting how he started calling at Amazon from the beginning it he pulls you and he does what we call loss leaders okay so we\nGet so much money he loses money to undercut\nEverybody else gains market control than you know\nPosed in close enough to slap in the face and now he owns the Washington Post so he can control the message you can control the media there's\n... ... am not that bad I mean obviously they have done positive destruction they have challenge things but this market dominance and this monopolistic behavior and and how brutal they are\nAre too small business it is it's tough it's you know uh\nSo it it comes at anti trust level I mean by a large I Love the efficiency that he built in and I I have time also and I liked it challenges to you know ... ... businesses are opposites as well the monopoly and that'd be great\nYou know yeah well actually I wouldn't because you know Michael I've told I told my audience mild metaphor is not as good as your baby tiger metaphor but I've told them you know if you said what I like to be the only talk show host in America no because having competition sharpens my game and I'm afraid I'd get lazy if I was the only game in town\nRight near the exactly right so why is the founding fathers decentralized power to unify towers bad\nWith human beings that just governments so we have Amazon who now has these\n... you know these machines that listen to what they can understand what's going on as data that is now wants to be the only clout for services provider for the military for a decade and the amount\nOf a market steak corner and that that they connect between those markets is terrifying when it's in the military\nAnd personal information and and and you know the newspaper and the media it's you know it it's not about them it's turning into a true antitrust play and that's where it's going to go\nWhat has the FCC had the securities and Exchange Commission had anything to say about this because they certainly regulate my industry heavily they tell radio companies you can only own somebody radio stations and every market and we're not going to allow you to become dominant or is it do not big enough yet to to trigger that\nI ... well ... you know when all anyone cares about the media today as Russia Russia Russia and they can't believe about from President they set the price we pay because\nLet's listen to these big tech companies you know how fast these guys got huge it's like that movie alien where it's almost a cute in the beginning and then like ten minutes in the movie is\nEight feet tall so you know and even like wait a minute why happen air or kind of caught off guard but he's big companies also learned from Microsoft when the government jumped on micro\nMicrosoft stuff that they were in Seattle is having a nice life and hear Tom's Europe and the U.S now everyone learns net and\nAll you know Amazon ... lobbying and they've got these beautiful beautiful offices in DC and so it is so this Google and so does Facebook and they're all breaking bread and getting everybody I mean they're not down there protecting their turf and their shareholders so\nYou know it's um it's a tough situation we have our problems in our diction with our Facebook and our Amazon Prime\nI guess what I worry about it is and this is the other worry I have Michael ... that even if we say well they're too big I got two responses one is you mentioned Sears and Roebuck well ... no longer and they're about to go out of business would seems\nBut back when ... first came on the scene they had to be one of the first uh entities that enter the market place and said\nYou don't have to buy your dung agrees with the local general store you can just drop you know dropping out in the mail and they'll show up you know back to you and I imagine at the time it was probably viewed as pretty darned amazing to say\nUh you know I can you mean I can order pots and pans and sheets and blankets and pillows and all that stuff and it'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else so Sears was kind of revolutionary back in the day I understand that Amazon is on that on steroids\nBut we were you know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure there were probably concerns of the time that we're going to wipe out the local general store will they didn't you know we have lots of these big retailers in America now and they didn't wipe out the local general store but I'm a guarantee you they had an effect\nThe second concern I have is this um that\nAs we're in a world marketplace now if we say Amazon we got a break you up into pieces to make sure you don't get too big wheeled China and other countries have the same constraints because remember when it's a worldwide service me a worldwide Internet\nIf you say Amazon can't get big but China can have a you know or you know can have companies that are that big\nWe going to see the day where we've knocked down our own Goliath our own Amazon and we've allowed all the other countries that don't have the same kind of restraint to do it and now Americans will be buying from them instead\nI can I can buy a small business part because although I saw what they did to\nPublishing the government part I I'm a little bit less less empathetic on because you know apple apple Amazon and the the rights and the constitution of belief and that human rights things\nThat they just look the other way when they do business there is no Tories a lead me to believe that if we put our foot down they're not going to go out running we're not going to give our power away and that while they want to practice and do business there they don't necessarily want to be there so\nUm it it just and this is the topic for discussion and there's no right or wrong answer because they have done a lot of really good innovation\nAnd that's good but there's also a lot of crushing going on and when it depends on the swings to find the other direction which I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas uh than we've got a problem at but you know these\nPeople have had so much money they do more profit margin is more than the economy's most country yup so which is very careful about this and they're interacting with our regulatory cars that right\nPretty lousy uh we'll all care about them for some of the United states not education and\nThat these regulations his lawyers with a you know law suits and they're they're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough to hold them accountable that's why I think the ... the only place to go and I'm Wondering what the the judicial system or not they will handle it off\nI just worry that some day we'll have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon selling to us and it'll all come in and big shipping containers and say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon and now we're going from you know a big company in China unless we could figure out a way to say you can't sell into our marketplace which\nSo far we have not done Michael Doherty is the author of the devil inside the beltway the shocking expose a of the U.S government surveillance an overreach into cyber security medicine in small business Michael it's a pleasure to have you on the\nProgram thank you sir good talking again glad to have you on by the way the liberals have taken off the gloves and they're fighting dirty in cold\nVersus the conservative should do the very same thing and we'll get to your phone calls and your emails at eight six six hey Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to\nUm it has disqualifying for a drunken college freshman to do that something I don't think anyone believes Brett Kavanaugh ever did\nAnd there's certainly no corroboration evidence witnesses or contemporaneous states\nI'm ... but in theory what the accusation was something that it's just qualifying for drunk college freshman to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and\nI'm the first accuser the one who's um testimony was was was supposed to be believable because people watched her and while she sure looks credible to me\nUm but hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years\nAnd what do you do when no one backed\nIt up at me and what about that front door she she had a front door because two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house\nThis is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in um she said that she rent they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or interns as she called them oh I think those interns are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that is a door to a rental apartment\nThat's a lie under oath or fear of flying\nUm that certainly seems to me to be falls and as much as ... jets all over the globe to go surfing\nUm who paid for the for the polygraph she corrected that one but whether she'd ever coached anyone on a polygraph or live in six your ex boyfriend\nSays that he was present when she was coaching one of her friends on how to take a polygraph something she was asked about under oath and denied um you know the next the next hearing\n'em the next Supreme Court justice to go and and be replaced and I have a few guesses about who that might be um it's it's going to be it's going to be an\nAbsolute this it will make Kavanaugh look like a day at the beach\nAnd what's the thinking I mean I'm just to some extent do you think prosecutors and destroying but the more local cases\nAre afraid to do this for fear of being accused by the me too crowd of you're attacking women know you're attacking a liar you're attacking a ... or so so what will it take to get those people to get a backbone\nAnd say we will go after every truly guilty sex offender in America but if you lie and tried to falsely accused somebody you too will face consequences\nNo in fact I think they should face the consequences of what they were accusing the other person of um false accusations of rape have sense have sent innocent men to prison um while I'm there's gotta be some some repercussions for that\nWell and and but where do you see the venue for being able to do I mean I'd like to do it but how do we do it I mean do you put pressure on the local prosecutor who's got the call it's not often as often gonna be a federal cases a local case so how do we get this to change to where we we said this is part of taking you serious way\nThat we take your ... your true accusation so seriously that when we find a folds one\nWhere I drew equally hard how do we get that dynamic to shift because right now I think most prosecutors would rather do anything in the war in and go after a fall took user\nIsn't as you indicate its owner mad this idea oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward no actually we do want to discourage that\nWe don't want people's lives being real and\nUm but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims um if you go after false accusers of rape um there's a there's a movie out now about Brian Banks that have a um really bright had a bright future when he was falsely accused of rape in high school\nServed five years in prison um got out and his accuser called and I apologize to them said she made it up I guess he got it on tape\nWe'll be about it but unfortunately it came out in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings\nSo it's gotten zero press that's this guy Brian Banks I tweeted a review of the movie um yesterday I'm but I'm dying to see it I've just I've just read the review on this guy's life completely I mean it's a horrible horrible thing that's being done and there has to be consequences for it\nWell I'm going to do this and the next time I talked to any politician other side of the aisle I'm going to say to them would you like to see us go after the faults accusers justice as to as tough as we go after those who are making a legitimate one her latest book\nIs called resistance is futile how the Trump painting loved lost its

seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com\nOne of those ... things for me is the extent to which the Democratic party seems to have fallen to pieces\nThey've lost over and over again they I Know they keep talking to a good game about how the midterms are going to be there whether they're going to win in the mid germs\nAnd then they pull up a stunt like the false accusations against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and that is starting to work against them so now they've decided to go rogue embracing violence of law ... behavior saying when they go high or when ... when they go low will kick 'em\nA road runner McDaniel joins us now who is chair of the Republican National committee it's good to have you back on the program\nIt's great to be here thanks for having me\nAm thrilled to have you on the program I just want to know what is the best way for Republicans to respond to this when some of the top figures in the Democratic party\nAre actually out openly inciting violence there doing it on camera there doing it quoted in major media\nAnd so apparently they're not afraid to say when we don't get the result we want where we're going to go out and engage in violence and we're going to incite other people's timid violence\nAnd all of this not too terribly long after Congress in ... college very nearly lost his life because the left he decided to try and slaughter a group of Republicans on baseball\nThe American people are probably going to respond to this\nWell it's a very dangerous path that the Democrat leadership uh\nIs putting their party on and it's a dangerous for our country when you hear Eric Holder said when they go low kick 'em Cory Booker saying get in their face Maxine\nWaters saying get crowds around people something's gonna happen we already had ... got shot we've already seen crowds on around Ted Cruz and chairs and there's an other cabinet members but this is not what we want for our country and I think Americans are looking at the essence saying it's not\nDemocrats not just regular average people this is the leaders of their party advocating for this and I think Hillary Clinton\nWhat she said is so remarkable it's a seismic shift in our democracy for her to say we will not be civil\nUnless we're in power what a threatening thing to say you do not think that law unless we're in power\nRun it you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of standing in the grocery store watching some poor mom deal the four year old and the serial Iowa who's decided usually it's a little boy who started stamping his feet and screaming at the top of his lungs and he's not going to be civil till the cap and crunch goes into the grocery bag is good and and it's the behavior you\nKind of expect from some kids who are poorly raised is not the kind of behavior you expect from top members of the Democratic party saying we're going to continue to be ... in civil I'm not sure which one is probably uncivil or until you give us power back and we're going to scream and yell and and probably\nHurt some people do they understand that the next time God Forbid but we could it almost seems inevitable that someone does get hurt or somebody does carry out a real active of violence that they're going to catch the blame on this\nI think so and I I think they're they're playing their cars in a way that they're hoping will engage their faith and turn them out at stoke angry division I mean with the Democrats have run out division for a long time but this is a new low for their party\nAnd it's frightening for our country we've already seen some instances that are frightening with these beliefs we've seen our senators having to have security detail this is not something we want long term\nFor our country and the Democrats need to be called out and I'm\nSaying is that you're one of the Republican Party I don't want you to go get Democrats basis I don't want you to go interrupt their family dinners or crate mobs around them what you should do is go go go get involved\nMake a difference volunteer stand up for that and you believe in but we can do it in a civil way and that is the greatness of our country and\nDemocrat leaders need to be called out and I hope\nThat the voters are looking at this because the only way we show the Democrats that they lose that this message is by them losing in these terms the only way we bring back stability to Washington is reject\nThe playbook that they've been riding on this temper tantrum but they've got drunk for two years now\nRon can I I Want to suggest something do I do this every time you're on I'd put a bug in Europe and I I don't know if it's you know if you if it's worth what it costs you let's put it that way\nBut I Would love to see since I Know the mainstream media will not do the thing they should do which is go to democratic leaders leaders in say will you condemn these calls for violence now\nI compared the other night I was in Seattle for a form of a panel with a bunch of other tacos from one of my ... and somebody said you know should we go out and let's go out and have some big protests I said it's never been the style of Republicans or conservatives especially to do that you have\nNice family friendly gatherings like the Tea Party that leaves the landscape cleaner than when they arrived we just don't do things that way\nAnd that's not just one of these where I'm trying to say on our side doesn't we don't you know as you can name any number of instances of left wing violence you don't see it from the right\nBut because the media won't call them out and I'm Talking about individual reporters can we get Republican officeholders and Republican office seekers to start demanding I mean the president is is you know understands that when you push the buttons of media\nIf we saw some Republican stand up in front of a crowd of reporters whenever they're holding a an event of some kind words covered and say why aren't you folks\nAsking for condemnation of this because I Will condemn it tonight\nAnd if if the Republican men and women are in office and seeking office would start demanding that\nI think the media can only ... ignore it so long and then they'll have to acknowledge well maybe we do need to go to Hillary Clinton and say you just you just try to incentivize violence why are you not condemning violence because ordinarily\nThat sort of the you know the go to for the Democrats in this case they should be uh I I think we should hold their feet to the fire\nI agree and and we just put together a video that was released today shelling some of these not that have been created a along with the words of the Democrat leaders we are definitely trying to hold Democrats accountable and you're right immediate need to do it and we need to help\nPush the media to act in a way that they don't always do because we know if it were a Republican who is that these things they'd be all over us so\nWe are going to continue to set an example of stability we're going to continue to run on the issue with\nThe results that have happened to this medication that has made life better for millions of Americans straight quite set up ... percent unemployment for a million jobs wait is that so many great things are happening across this country and legal contrast that with the resistance\nAnd the division and the destructive nature of the Democrat Party and hopefully on November sex that voters will reject\nThis terrible terrible a message that Democrats continue to put\nForth I mean because you remember back to the beginning of the campaign when President Trump then candidate Trump would go to various venues and he was in generating gigantic crowds\nAnd I can't remember who was Cleveland or another city where they literally had to shut the event down because of the folks who came in as interlopers\nIntending only to cause trouble and and when the president responded I think there were a couple of times what it was a candidate he said throw that guy out or punch him or you know things like that and they were at the media was all over oh my God are you in are you inciting violence or you endorsing violence\nBig you know they will do that as you say if it's a Republican who does it a conservative who says something if I took to the air and said let's go out the streets and burns and things like antifa does which I Would never do\nA you know that that that would be condemned quickly\nSo if the media won't if individual reporters won't do it on their own I think we should get our candidates to search shaming them into it\nWhy aren't you asking the other side asked to folks who are seeking reelection governor Kate Brown in the state where I broadcast ask her are you willing to condemn these kinds of tactics and the statements of Eric Holder when they go low let's kick up would you condemn that and if you want why not I think it might be effective run\n... talk ... who's written a book about gods now to two specific things and I think to conservatives these issues are familiar that kept the media way one it involved abortion although\nNot abortion the way it is done legally and the rights of but done Mars or a slaughterhouse and I don't think I'm over it you know I Know you know to Kermit goes now is black\nYeah it's funny actually funny somebody just real to me and said to me are you worried about being called racist\nI was working on this story from nearly two years before I realized with black you're just knew the name I just you know I met him I mean I I met him I Know I never noticed he was black and I admit that might sound weird people but it's like the least interesting thing about him like I literally didn't taking notes of of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's the Seventy two year old doctor who delivered babies alive and then cut them next with scissors and it's like somebody said to me you know he's black and I went oh God yeah he is actually but we had never thought of us I mean and I'm telling you the God's honest truth my husband and I neither of us notice that he was black now tell me\nAbout this the most interesting thing I think about your participation lose you got a chance to sit for three hours and talk to this man in person yeah for you in the same room where you through glass no I was\nIn the same room and I mean I was wondering why yeah well not good because I expected to have the glass I thought we were going to have the ... the protection of the Plexiglas in fact actually we're in this kind of coffee lounge\nWhere he had you know very free reign he was allowed to even move his chair and what he did was he came in I was backed up against the door about against ah against the wall and he pushed his share opened his legs and kind of you know trapped me between his legs if you know what I mean I my legs crossed and then it ...\nAs he would make points and it's on sorry once I'm terribly sorry\nAnd he was like you know kind of electric kind of character he has this meant less Lewis voice the soft voice\nHe smiles all the time kind of laugh you know and here he is serving three life sentences and talks about you know she was an awful shame he didn't get into the poetry class um and that he's reading the Koran in two different versions two different translations because he's just so role like that\nAnd you know he's getting to play a lot of music which is great you know when he listens to a lot of music and you know he really liked reading and hasn't been able to read because he's been so busy all these years\nBut it gave them to read true crime which he really enjoys I mean you're sitting there and he by the way he sang to me twice in the middle of this yeah because he was talking about music and then he said you know all you know when\nI started listening to ... you know ... and every now and again during the three hours he would do this brand free thing where he'd say what's the name what's the name and I love ... by the way the Belgian crusader who died you know a lot of your listeners would know having a big smoker and I think he just basically smoked himself to death\nBut he had this incredible voice ... goggles looking at me saying what's the name what's the song what's the name of that song doubling the famous one and I'm sitting there thinking do I tell them do I tell them at ... and then of course I say you know kind of ... and then he leans right in Maine goes in the key to a\nAnd start singing the song basically don't ever leave me you know it's like are you serious as this what's happening right now yeah so\nThat was the guy has no sense of what he's done or or the reaction that most people would have if you just generically told the story I mean left out the door but just said he murdered a couple of ... and does anyone know for certain how many babies were put to death by by having their spines Nicolas pursue one according to the\nGrand jury you know which I think you know if you think of how long they stop with this and hurt evidence they said ...\nIt was not and that is why exactly as you said in your introduction it is very safe to say he's America's biggest serial killer and you know John Wayne gave the Ted Bundy the Soviet kill all of them combined\nCome nowhere near that so this guy and you know the only reason he's not on the list of the most prolific serial killers in America is the only reason is because you'd have to acknowledge the humanity of those children\nAnd that is something that we want to do we want to make sure he gets the title because these were human beings I've seen the photographs of them I can tell you these are these are children who world will never no no and we need to acknowledge them and be a you know be a witness to the fact that they lived and and\nIt's not an overreach to call his clinic an average war than it was a
