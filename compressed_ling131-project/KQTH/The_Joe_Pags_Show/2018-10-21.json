last couple of years we've talked a lot about\nThe opioid crisis and I've done my best to try to get your straight data because we now know that about Seventy two thousand people every year in the United states over does and the overdose because of opioids\nOf abuse of of pharmaceutical drugs the kind that come from a legitimate companies\nAnd the other Ninety percent die because of street drugs\nLike heroin that comes across our borders and there is a real connection to the borders and I thought we'd get Derrick molds on who's a former special agent in charge us a sea of the United States Department of justice drug Enforcement Administration and the special operations division and he's involved in a documentary called not in vain\nA dark welcome to the program\n[noise] hey how are you great to be on the program\nI I'm doing great but I you know I don't happen to have a heroin addiction and frankly I haven't had anybody in my family at least that I'm aware of who's had that but I I Know of some you know some folks I'm a queen did with who've lost kids they've lost family members because of addiction to heroin an addiction to pharmaceutical drugs\nAre I Want you to tell my audience you know before they go see not in vain this new documentary about this connection because for a long time I've emphasized that your former agency the da says about Ninety percent of that heroine comes across the border from Mexico so part of the solution seems pretty self evident doesn't it\nYeah no exactly and so the public needs to know first of all we have not only a public health crisis but we have a national security emergency because these Mexican cartels that it's dumping poison all over the country is what's killing people yes you're right\nThere's a low percentage of pharmaceutical pills that are actually killing Americans right now that they asked majority is being killed from\nThe mixtures of this potent scent than all the synthetic a drug coming right from China and the labs in China and then mixing it with everything and large the thing is is that it's not just\nSomebody that could dictate on heroin it's a college kid that thinks taking an adult pill\nIs going to keep 'em alert in this in the quiet in class and stay focused but what they don't realize is the pills mix with pencil and by the way for the view is one kilogram of fencing all can kill about five hundred thousand adults because it only takes two grain to milligrams\nOffensive to kill an adult\nBut we have a we have a much larger issue laws because you know another thing is these terrorist groups like Hezbollah they're tapping into the criminal networks to their funding and their resources or we had a case a couple of years ago on Jumo is moving to a hundred million dollars a month to support Hezbollah and he was moving the proceeds furloughs that is a\nYou know cartel you know so we have a very serious problem and the American public just doesn't understand it can impact anyone of us if you look at not in vain Marron rigs was Twenty years old she was a beautiful young girl\nWho had very much I loved her family passion polite typical kid you know playing sports she was a captain of the golf team and lots of friends and then her brother finds a dead\nBecause she got a ticket and then she went out on to you know by some of this stuff and it's it's mixed with whatever was in\nThe particular you know packaging she she bought but the point is is they don't know what they're getting and that's the issue Mexican cartels do not have you know train cameras that are actually caring about quality control they care about making money\nAnd grow in their business and the price and the scary part laws is the fact that China is developing all these chemical compounds and dumping it on our country and China is a communist country so\nYou know what better way to disrupt the Americans by you know then by killing their their their children and by you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple at facets of this problem\nDarren Scott I'm Talking to dirt malls\nAnd their their their children and by you know destroying their communities and so we have multiple at facets of this problem\nDarn Scott I'm Talking to dirt mauled who's a former special agent in charge of the da da da\nDa da da da da da da da to try to interdict some of these drug operations inside their borders because that seemed like the logical place to stop and we can try to stop it from being smuggled in but as you pointed out a tiny quantity goes a long way\nOr the Chinese doing much of anything to try to go after these drug a drug criminals that are making it\nLet's put it this way in China a lot of these chemicals are not even illegal to export and these cameras that they hire\nTheir their very clever because they know what the controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change a little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and so the U.S government\nThe department of justice the DEA has had several meetings recently with China to try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying wise all over America so there has been some increased cooperation but lost honestly it's really not it's nothing to brag about I mean the pope the politics\nThe politicians will make like everything's moving down to write at\nBut it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they not aggressive enough with them it is China it's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese experts but you know and your listeners know that China is a really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it\nYou know their debt hacking off computers they're still on our identities\nThey're going after a financial grades and I lecture grades\nSo you know dumping poison in our country is just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had a few of them say selling heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west are making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans\nSo this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially you know what's going on depending on you know who in China is actually sending at all well\nBecause I think about what they accomplish if they can manufacture the drugs treat boy and the Chinese government turned a blind eye to it and allows it to happen they not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause and all that cash\nFrom producing those stuff flows back into China one way or the other which is good for China because China is in the soup financially so they they get ... I get to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cash at the same time it's a win win and I\n[noise] I call it a two for one special laws I mean they win\nEvery which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just in it for the money and they're making billions of dollars as you know and they're right on our border and\nThere's so many illegal here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects of the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the money collections the drug distribution stash houses you know building compartments these guys are all over our country\nA and honestly we've got to shut down at the border\nAnd I want to really make a difference\nBut stuck it in the military involved and my my ... my opinion my opinion it sounds a little bit traumatic but if you look up on the website department of state has criteria for how you designate a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good all common sense\nLook at what the Mexican cartels are doing and they meet the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization if that happens then we'll have different authorities to use\nDoing and they meet the criteria to be designated apart terrorist organization if that happens then we'll have different authorities to use our military and others to kind of feel that water\nAnd now it's nonsense off which is what the politics you know if you look at nine eleven yeah Iraq or Afghanistan war you added up every one that died and then ... ... ...\nIt's still west at how many people died last year from trucks so what is the American public and to realize the wake up stop listening at these phony politicians that are in it for their own personal pocket books in their wallets and if you choose they're not really in it for the public safety or national security aspects\nThe story is told in not in vain to brand new documentary out Derek molds is very involved in dark thank you for your work at the da ... tough job and things are working on not in vain we appreciate you taking the time to night\nThat Trump had said it's a scary time for young\nSome of the segment made sense if the quote had been accurate\nThat Trump had said it's a scary time for\nYoung men um only if you lie and insert old white men in there and do you bring on um you know professor of urban studies and and host of the BEP network to talk about white supremacy I'm halfway through the segment Anna ... switch true why from\nSomething we made up in the back room here at CNN to an actual Trump strategy\nAsking will this Trump's strategy work uh it's really absolutely outrageous them and in my notes to readers and I wish anyone listening wouldn't go find it and print it out\nUm put it in put it in your wallet for the next time people say oh there's no such thing as fake news um these are the guardians of the first amendment yes every once in a while there is a typo no this was a deliberate vicious\nRacists lie about the president\nNot only was it not corrected I'm In that segments if there's been a mistake I think it would have been corrected before before the first commercial break 'em and you know come up with something different to talk about\nAs far as I Know that has never been corrected on CNN Anna ... after 'em or I guess I don't know about the same time I called was running other people may have noticed this she send out this vein tweets\nI'm saying I made an error I'm Sorry about that something to that effect absolutely no mention of what the error was\nIt goes to her pathetic list of ... of of of Twitter followers and as as small as CNN's ratings are I Believe more people saw her segment with why then you know went to Anna ... Twitter feed to see this vague I made an error how would a segment ... correcting the entire segment\nWell and what's crazy as they could have done some legitimate journalism and said it is a scary time to be a man now and I'll tell you this is one of the things I kept emphasizing use\nIf somebody can come out with a Finley evidence accusation that that has nothing behind it no witnesses no nothing in the person bringing me\nYou know charge can't even remember all the details where ... who how and that can destroy\nA man or and as I pointed out in these ... times\nA man or a woman's uh you know a a a ... their entire career they're good name their family\nWipe them out financially and say oh I'm Sorry it was a folds it was a false accusation or we think it was called but by this time you've already destroyed the person it is a scary time when that ... one little accusation can end up destroying a person and wait until the first time\nYou know that a woman says well you know this this professional woman came on to me and they destroyed a doctor or a lawyer or a politician or well I was\nAt one time you can be sure you're going to see it again is one Trump gets another Supreme Court nominee which is why I Am and systems that he make it a man\nI'm everyone thinks oh don't worry they won't be able to do anything with a woman yeah 'cause you know they loved Sarah Palin today love me you know they'll just come up with something new now that we know what their ... book is they're not going to be able to pull the the the false allegation of a high school groping on the next one that would be too embarrassing\nSo they'll have to do something slightly different and frankly you know you reminded me of you remember back when the ridicule was heaped on on Gerald Ford because Chevy Chase portrayed him as being incredibly clumsy and we knew if you looked at the man's history he was an athlete he was\nThe fact of layer at University of Michigan\nI stand out he was a

that was the comedian playing the parody on the anti Republican pro left a television show Saturday Night live\nIt had no but it becomes and they use to make fun of Reagan saying oh Reagan imagine those things from the movies and then you'd go back and say no that was actually based on history is you write or pretending that things happened in the movie\nThis is what's driving them absolutely

yourself a band you know for saying things that are really out of line and yet Lewis Farah cans seems to be able to get away with just about anything he wants to on Twitter and he never get suspended how is that\nAh that's called by us so I mean let's let's be honest here\nBut then the one of the big\nProblems that the social media search media companies have is they don't treat everybody the same if Louis Farrakhan were some sort of right wing anti Semite or you know central wing or new anti Semite he'd be gone a long time ago he's\nA left wing cook but he's got big connections he has long at big connections\nEverybody for Obama on down he you know the the left in this country has kissed his lunatic rang for many years and he gets away with it so he lost a little while back\nHe lost his check mark yeah the one that gives you a little sense of oh you're you're famous person but he's got about a million followers and\nAnd while Facebook got the post taken down he's still on Facebook he's I garbage person it is said to compare Jewish people to insects\nAnd it's it's a kind of stuff that we used to see in Nineteen thirties Germany propaganda\nThe kind of thing he gets away with and the and the folks at Twitter let him do it and he ought to be on a watch list at Twitter I mean for the kinds of things that he says I mean in in the way that I Hope not to be I think I tried to keep most of my comments pretty sensible ...\nBut what it really points to is apocryphal these organizations look you know I I come from the era of more speeches better speech and so\nYou know if they're going to leave Louis Farrakhan up there why the heck is Alex Jones doubt ah they're gonna do it I mean\nThere if you're going to allow people that somebody thinks it's frigid and and as far as the case I I didn't see anybody defending it probably there are a nation of Islam people out there because he's got a lot of followers and there were a lot of people were cheering him and that\nYou know bigoted anti Semitic audience but the reality is he was attacked by the left he was attacked by the center is backed by the rights and the way it really is going after him for a long time a prominent journalist for criticizing him\nAnd he's still there because you know in the world of the left if you are a representative of victim group\nOh well then you can't do bigoted stuff that's always been their argument that's got to be what they're claiming here even though he directly violates their terms against hate speech directly\nPay I Want to ask you about something um have you seen this piece of video of an antifa man I'm just bashing and end up costing a woman who is the widow of one of the police officers who died in the nine eleven terrorist attacks in New York City\nAnd this guy this is running on Fox and I've rented today earlier and I may play ... I can play some it if you like but these are two people they're not confronting each other the woman is just standing at a street corner\nA I guess we're both perhaps headed in the direction of a protest the anti per guy for his side of the protests during the widow of a police officer in the direction of the you know a a a different protests to counter protest\nBut this man begins to things that young man and the woman is not wouldn't say older but she's she's older than he is\nUm and he just begins bashing your cursing or a wishing that her husband are you know rocks in his grave after she informs him the she's the widow of a police officer who died in the terrorist attack and I don't see it running on a lot of other of the sort of mainstream media other than Fox on cable um or should they be have you see\nI haven't yet I've seen is yes and it\nI lost two of my classmates and nine eleven which is nothing in comparison to losing a family member but I I you know for people who live in Washington I live in New York this was a a local attack not just a national attack\nWe all knew people and you know this is very personal and watch it I get so angry as to get up and walk with the computer I that's that's my reaction\n... but this is how the American news media fix everything they do we always end up talking about biased by commission that the oh this comeback said this is gone back and said that\nYou know this reporter lied this they did this thing with the worst bias in news media is biased by omission they hide the things that are uncomfortable to their narrative if they went out there and you got Chris quoting Chris Matthews both out there saying oh the Republicans are hyping this mom thing it's all garbage it's all a lie and when in fact\nNo it's the absolute truth it is a problem and you've got\nYour monsters like this city and I may I is absolute\nMonster to do this he must have seen had I think\nI think you did because she was wearing an NYPD had and he started berating her oh your husband do do do this and she said I'm not married he said well then you're you're NYPD cop boy\nDating her oh your husband do do do this\nAnd she said I'm not married he said well then you're you're NYPD cop boyfriend and he brings up the Abner ... assault that happened involving New York cops two decades ago ... ... you know I mean I remember it because I'm an old guy but I don't even know I didn't even know somebody who's age would even remember it\nBut but he's breathing this woman in the most ... terms and you think\nThis is somebody who's not under assault he's not in the face to face grilled to grill a kind of confrontation replay it just so the audience knows what I'm Talking about I believed out all the bombs you'll hear the beep generic\nKind of Iraq\nIndian\nI'm not like your husband\nAnd I got it for him\nGood might be much of mine\nIn not in mind thing immigrants and their bully thing [noise]\nBut yeah you're right and the great\nRock and the grave and she's standing there waiting for a traffic light to change so she can walk across an intersection legally and he just starts into her\nAunt and his screaming and yelling at her in a way that I'm very sure Dan\nFar surpasses that the standard you have to get to be called you know the crime of intimidation somebody walks up to you on the street and start talking you and that kind of threatening manner they're committing a crime is it's no longer free speech you would think this would be getting a lot of play in the major media CNN MSNBC\nAnd with them having but then they'd have to explain that a lot of these and keep it creeps this is their regular MO all they do is attack people even people who are doing nothing provocative\nThings that they say I mean I I Know that\n... years of watching lifted protests under my belt this thing's called they call for ... of police officers on to a live broadcast the name of police officer ... police officers the foul things they say the police officers and go\nOh yeah you just things I Can't even I won't repeat\nThey just said this to this woman\nYou know this is where the last year this doesn't end well there there's so much pent up anger on their side and that they want to confront you want to her she wanted to cause a scene that's what they try to do they actually train them to do this they train them so that\nAll around the country that also includes two suicides\nAnd all on accusations of sexual misconduct\nNow there hasn't been a whole lot of investigation about this so uh you know people sometimes as I said don't collected a connect the dots but they have been weaponized saying this for a long time they've gone after Democrats and Republicans but they seem to go after Democrats who are telling the\nThe party line surprisingly\nYeah those are the ones who vote against sweeping gun bills like the one in Colorado a so something very sinister has been going on pretty much for the last year\nBut you would think that after a year of sort of cleaning house whether you're swept up some good people along the bad people and you had some folds accusations that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets wouldn't work\nNow they never run out of targets because when they do they just manufacture evidence or there's a case this case I mentioned chew and Colorado you know there were two very suspicious cases one in Colorado one in Arizona\nSteve led sock and Colorado Don shooter in Arizona they didn't stay on these people fighting back what they wanted to do was forced them out\nScare the heck out of them and asked them to resign they were targeted and\nAnd I'll tell you in the Colorado case they had a um a day in which Democrats and Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after a hundred and three years\nNever had been an expulsion in the Colorado State house of representatives that day a Democrat got up and said because my wife\nExpulsion in Colorado State house of representatives that day a Democrat got up and said because my wife was molested when she was Seventeen I'm going to vote yes on expulsion of Steve ...\nNow and now this is these are law makers who are\nPutting forth arguments that would be thrown out of court in a nanosecond so I that's what I became suspicious and I started doing a little research on this and I was I was truly appalled at what I found they had flown out due process a long time ago well\nIn fact a lot of it got thrown out in all the title nine nonsense the letter guidance that went to the colleges where they said if you can't get a legitimate set of charges against say student athletes who are thought to have committed some sexual assault\nThen put it into effectively a kangaroo court uh and and in those cases\nIt's interesting that some of those targets were I mean I think most people too young to to to categorize politically one way or another almost be a political college student athlete who may be officially a Democrat or a virtually Republican but\nYou know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through the ringer\nAnd with no evidence no nothing they would they would end up being kicked out of school the worst thing you could do to them at that point in their life because they haven't built a career like like a judge Kavanaugh had\nOr now justice capital head so I I just want to hear the odd for that and thank God for that but you wonder how much are they going to go and eat almost instantaneous reaction well if he's accused you must be guilty and let's move on to the next one that's a dangerous standard to adopt in a due process country like America\nWithout a doubt and among my many concerns about this is the notion that you can\nUh build some kind of um [noise]\nWhen he goes well let me go back to what you said at the beginning or these are people who've been trashing the culture all along and and in a heartbeat they had made an about face and are now acting like Puritans so ... number one we cannot\nBuy in to this idea the left is brilliant at building a culture that's what I wanted to say they build a culture around these these false notions\nAnd that's how you get I was listening on line to your last interview and it was it was stunning and riveting to hear I saw that video and and you've got\nLawmakers who are actually leading the charge in lawless nuts\nYeah and that is they're developing a sort of a hard core double standard where what an ... person does something that is a criminal assault in most communities\nTo merely by walked up to somebody on the street corner today and just started shouting at them in screaming at them and I did it for any length of time if there was a police officer within\nYou know within earshot he'd come over and say you're going to knock that off now you're going to jail because that's the crime of intimidation so we're excusing it for certain people\nBecause they opposed Trump and then we're saying but for everyone else there is a hard and fast you know kind of standard and we will we\nCompletely destroyed if you cross turns thank

things\nTrade them or you can control them yeah\nYeah and that right there is a and a demo or who is a disinformation researcher talking about Twitter and all of these things that they've released data ten million tweets from foreign operators going all the way back two years\nAnd what is it to do well fear we talked about greed feared the it's always about voting and emotion it's about voting and emotion and and I get this now I get people who send me stuff some people send me stuff and they want to like I I'm going to prove a point other people send me stuff and they say stuff like\nIs this true and then I'll have to go\nLook at the website right look at the website and a lotta times their Web sites\nThat are here in America there are American run websites who have their they have their ideology that they have and they're going to spend something or they're gonna leave out half of the story and that is it that that is frustrating but you have to look at the ... the website how reputable is it who are these is isn't it amazing\nThat it only lines up with the way that you believe because for a lot of us it's about affirmation it's not about information so it was easy to do you pick a few things and I see it all the time when we posted in St and do stuff what what agitated angry people what doesn't it's not hard to tell\nOne of the really striking example just after the San Bernardino shooting in California in December twenty Fifteen most of the trolls were posting about the need for the second amendment and and to protect gun rights but some of the trolls posting civil dynasty and using the same hashtags to push for gun control\nBecause they don't care for the whole thing is to disrupt people like this they just want to disrupt\nPeople here who want to sell something if you will a about a politician about a prop they're going to tell you half a story or bend the truth or in some cases out now lie\nBecause they want you to vote for something here it was about a disruption they didn't care if they could just upset the apple cart\nThat's the whole thing and the frustration is is so many people buy into it and this is where I get frustrated because I look at this and I think\nVery nanny state if they want to turn this into now like Facebook and Twitter and all of these companies are getting together with the government and their ...\nAnd well we need to protect these people look if you're an idiot in a mean happens to invoke such an emotion out of you and I see it out there every single day I see it out every day if you were so upset about a mean or something and your so influenced by that that's what you write your gullible\nYou're ... if it was as you that much your gullible it's it's it's that's that's just the truth\nWill the accounts trying to do is Moscow grade as real American activists and engage with three American activists communities\nAnd they did they didn't know how much influence that have that's a different thing but remember ever ...\nIf you study psychology study any of these things it's about a voting and emotion because emotions will get you to I always hearken back to what an emotion can do for somebody when I go back to the fact that\nAh that that [laughter] that astronaut\nWoman who was so enraged and in love and their motion for that or the other astronaut that left her she drove across country wearing adult diapers had like duct tape or in a car her motion was so\nFat to me it's just oh how do you do lots of motion when you can get people to to to not have a conversation to be blinded by something so much so\nWhen I Do my when we do videos and we do all these kinds of stuff all season people chime in and there are a motion is so strong on some certain thing\nSo and when I Do my when we do videos and we do all these kind of stuff all season people chime in and there are a motion is so strong on some certain things\nIt's it's crazy it really is you take a step back take a breath but they're blinded by and then what happens they get Indian dated every single day by step because they're\nLooking and they're searching and and they're searching for some of the left does it with their micro aggressions and things like that\nThe right does the same thing too and everybody searching percent what can I find what can I find I Want some affirmation I Want some affirmation oh this person asked me what country I'm from so their for their they've offended me or this over here this mean came through and this has to be true about Elizabeth Warren or something like that and\nIt's a motion is emotion emotion emotion and you're being manipulated and you don't always know your right because sometimes the stuff looks so real but in saying that that's why you need to be\nWell versed in a lot of these things meaning you're gonna have to do some research if you're serious about am I being manipulated you'll do some research if you only one affirmation then at that point in time it doesn't really matter and the main is only firing you have to do something it's not actually changing your mind because your minds already made up\nYou can actually see through the lifetime of these accounts they were posting more and more radical content and they were trying to get people more and more riled up because that's when they got the most impact so that's the way social media tend to look the more emotion you put into it the mole feedback you get\n\nThat again emotion greed all of those things the best sales book you'll find in the world has nothing to do with sales has old to do with the psychology you want to learn how to sell go down and get a psychology book\nBecause when you can find a psychology book that that has the right kind of tone that you know that you can start to manipulate 'cause that's what it is\nSome people buy stuff but a lot of people are sold stuff how do you do it with a motion you can look great in his car unit tons of women you can make so much money if you do this or by this it's it's nuts it's crazy it's about emotion three two three five three twenty four twenty three ...
