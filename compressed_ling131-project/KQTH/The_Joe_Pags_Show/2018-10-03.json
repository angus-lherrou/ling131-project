when you can be a sea of something that you may not be guilty or was it very very very difficult time Donald\nTrump as usual has zeroed in on the one issue in this entire controversy even for Americans who don't pay much attention to what goes on to the Supreme Court which\nI think it's foolish because what happens at the Supreme Court has an effect right down to ground level\nIt affects your church it affects your work it affects your community it affects the way the laws are applied to American citizens and non citizens if you're not paying attention okay I get it some Americans can't be bothered but the one issue that will resonate all the way down to the grassroots is this one\nThink about the man or woman in in your life and this at some point will probably applied to women as well as men in this case with Brett Kavanaugh it applies to men\nIn particular and as the president said said to be to be accused of something and you are guilty until you prove yourself innocent\nThat appears to be the new standard push by one side of the political aisle\nAren't backing that standard but Democrats are saying if you're accused your accuser will be believed and you will be just believed and as Chris Coons the senator we played the soundbite last week as Chris Coons said last week\nIt is judge Kavanaugh's burden to prove that he did not do these things I never

shows on right after Tucson morning news but for now here's moral Lars Larson on one oh four one K. to be a\nWelcome back to Lars\nLarson Joe it's a pleasure to be with you and I'm Glad to take your phone calls and emails in just a moment I started out with the president's comments that were in a terrible spot today where a man and it primarily applies to men although you could easily see the same kind of scandal involving women\nBut that a man is accused and if he's accused he's guilty until he proved himself innocent that's been the gist of the cabinet investigation from the beginning of this which you'll remember I'll point out\nStarted and what was supposed to have been the end of all of the hearings into confirming him as a Supreme Court justice offering gap and he joins me now who's founder and president of the center for security policy and Frank\nIs a little outside of what we usually talk about here but uh but I Want to know\nDo we know which FBI's investigating Kavanaugh is this the corrupt one that had to have a ... a number of people like call me and McCabe and others fired or is this one that can actually turn around a a good solid investigation and quiet some of these democratic protest\n[laughter] well I don't think anything's going to\nSilence the Democratic process because this isn't about\nHis record this is about uh what he would do on the court they're determined to wage political warfare against until they destroy it ended I\nOf course the state of the court of law floors I I don't know the answer that question I I think it's a tremendously important one and we have a reason to believe that the guys who would be doing\nThe investigation\nOf the charges would be\nYou know drawn from the large ranks of patriotic law\nEnforcing ed law abiding FBI agents\nThe trouble is that I'm quite certain that there are among the ranks of the leadership of the FBI still people liked them caves and\nLike the Kobe's unlikely pages and struck some bakers and so on and those people may or may not\nBe able to do much at this point a to corrupt\nWhat comes out of the field investigations background investigation but I think we have to take it as a gift and that they'll do whatever they can\nBecause this is part of the counter state it's not just deep state truthfully it's like counter state and they are\nAs in bed and is determined to defeat Donald Trump and his presidency is any of those Democrats on the Judiciary Committee or elsewhere in the Senate or for that matter you know that the that resist and anti tapes I'm afraid\nHere's what I'm thinking about Frank because one of the questions of because we have this press corps that is just dead set against Trump\nWhat they never considered is that we have three branches of government you know judicial legislative and executive\nThe judicial who is you know that we're considering Kavanaugh for that the legislative branch\nBecause of the insistence of Jeff Flake has said we want the executive branch the FBI which is under the executive branch to investigate this even though the legislative branch has its own resources to do this I I Know that people maybe haven't thought of this\nHe has a huge staff of people who are professional investigators and who have the expertise to do the very same thing\nThat the FBI is doing except I Wonder whether the Democrats no we've got some deep stayed friends over in the FBI who as you said are still there and they're still willing to carry water for us and we'll produce the result we won\nInstead of the result they might get from the ... from the Congress's own investigators who are perfectly capable of looking into this because all the FBI is doing right now for the most part\nIs interviewing people and asking questions well there are people on the Senate Judiciary committee staff who could be doing that too and it would be directly under the control of the Congress although it would be under the control of a Republican Congress\nRight well that's the rub isn't it [noise] you know I had an interesting conversation today with a fella by the jak cash show who you were in Denver I chose a you interviewed back when he published a book about TWA eight hundred wish exposed what\nThe corruption that the FBI and the CIA during the Clinton Administration meant in terms of essentially covering up\nWhat actually happened taking down that flight a accidentally uh but uh with devastating effect\nAnd you put into the mix um\nI think the well the manipulation and\nAbuse of a couple of other investigations Oklahoma City being one yep\nI'm of course the Clinton Hillary Clinton email scandal thing another and and this most recent one more solar celebrating barking I should say the anniversary of in this week and that is the Las Vegas shooting I think all of these have been\nInstances where people in leadership in the FBI did the ... and and collapse\nThe work of that organization which is needed by our country um and\nUnfortunately has damaged the reputation of the whole enterprise as a result of what these guys have done so I think that was operating for some Democrats it's kind of amazing today that uh it wasn't a concern to Republicans given what we've been watching play out here while I was just one of those scandals of those recent one Hillary's\nAnd think about this Frank I mean I think this is relevant they missed the pulse nightclub and I won't even have the whole is 'cause I'm doing this for memory they missed on metal is cruise at Parkland, Florida\nThe up probably high you know I understand there are good people who work there I Know some people who work at the FBI the lower ranks in the age and ranks either took that agency as an agency even at the local field office in say Florida\nHas screwed up and we've seen these screw ups and we've documented number of the screw ups where we've watched in real time as their screw up led to literally dead bodies in American cities\nAnd then we said but we can trust them to do a competent job of investigating something that seems\nWell the the longer that that goes on since you know last week since last Thursday\nThe more we seem to be seeing this story fall apart a Julie sweat story is falling apart\nThe W ... story is falling apart and even a a Christine Cooke story is falling apart and yet still vote we've got an agency that has occasionally produced a you know bad results or no result or political results doing the investigation\nOr you know human I've talked about this a lot over the years bars but one other piece of this which again I think is a function of bad leadership has been um the fact that lots of these ...\nI Would argue it stipulate that virtually all of them are good people the field level people but they've been denied training about the nature of the enemy that we're facing a specifically the says Sharif's the premises that's been your boat just above lower\nThe men out most closely associated with this a witch hunt against President Trump but we'll recall before was the director of the FBI and he said we're not going to have people training\nIn a way that would offend or Islam or Muslim and so these are the kinds of issues that have caused people that I buy are greatly a fellow particularly I'm sure you know Chris feral yep\nOf judicial watches said listen we need to start over you know the eight suggest using the U.S marshals office says the sort of\nA nucleus of a new Federal Bureau of investigations but to basically a rip this went up by the roots and start over and I looked great believer that we need the capability but we may need to do oh\nYeah I think we do less than a minute Frank the comment on the attempt apparently to assassinate a James Mattis today\nI haven't heard about it\nOver to the regular anything about it at all and below full of rice and sent to the Pentagon address to general matters so you know I mean we're in a strange time and and I and I hate to say it but I kinda think that that was a domestic\nThat would set the courts ideological direction I Believe just say we're going to follow the constitution or for the next forty years or so given the age of the current justices\nIf they do and if the Republicans do not confirm Kavanaugh by the end of this week two things are going to happen one cabinet won't be seated too there isn't enough time to pick a replacement and run them through the vetting process\nAnd a lot of Republican voters will look at the cave in by the Republicans and say\nI may not show up in November to vote and when they do that likely we will not get another conservative justice on the court and we will not a ... and we may lose the Senate or the house or a little bit of both\nAnd if that happens then America changes\nForever probably and if we do get them on then we have a court that will follow the constitution instead of following ideology\nAnd I think the Republicans are voters or a head of the midterm election will be invigorated if for lack of a better word by saying oh the Republicans actually followed through and did what they were supposed to do and that will reflect in their votes in November So ... we really are at a big divide right now\nIf Kavanaugh gets on gets in great things are going to happen if he does not I think America we ... we may lose the Republican Congress and Donald Trump won't get another thing done for the next two years and they will set themselves the Democrats will set themselves up well for twenty twenty\nWhat concerns me a lot in regards to that is the Democrat that seems like they they pick and choose what they want to follow up to date a lot of all of them by the way around to find a way to reword it\nLooked like it as we all have no immigration it's all open border\nAnd there'll be a systematic disarm them that it's just\nI think you're absolutely right and and and and consider that that not only do the Democrats invent invite a oh boy we just got word cliff I'd mentioned to Frank ... the James Mattis at the Pentagon received a letter didn't go all the way to him but they intercepted as contending rice and\nA judge my producers just solar made it we just got word that Trump also received a letter had they confirmed that there was rice and are they saying just white powder at this point Ted Ted Cruz's office got a letter with or two letters with white powder and apparently President Trump's office also received\nA letter with white powder in it which is designed to at least frightened and terrorize or if not actually do damage will have to find out what the white powder is but I wanted to work at in\nBut think about what's going to happen\nIf if we go this direction we want people on the court who will follow the constitution the Democrats actually invent things that were never in the constitution for example it might surprise people to know that\nThat privacy is not mentioned anywhere in the constitution but there had been Supreme Court decisions that had been AAA did privacy end of the constitution marriage is not mentioned by the constitution so now we have a famous Supreme Court decision recently\nThat found a right to marriage and a right to gay marriage in the constitution\nIf the Democrats are allowed to gain control and put people on the court who would say we can invent\nYou shouldn't and if the Congress won't pass a law will get the Supreme Court to effectively write a law then a lot of your rights are going to go away\nBut I don't think they realize as a\nYou know what I lost your cell phone and I'm Sorry for that cliff let's go to Dave Dave ... were tied to the break but what's on your mind tonight\nOh just the Republicans do it in I mean I like it at the corner in the world of hurt I'm I'm just want Trump to do the same promises the law\nI'm really worried at all these illegal immigrants are raised in the health care costs they talked to this other friend of mine and he thinks a lot of my premiums are she got ... percent that a lot of gold that don't have jobs going in there\nGetting free medical yep which is like Costa but I Can't afford

Facebook and Twitter sees Lars Larson show [noise] welcome\nBack to the Lars Larson Joe glad to be with you and go on to get your phone calls and your emails at eight six six\nAds eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com and they say that politics makes for strange bedfellows I Know lots of bad jokes out there especially when you're talking about Michael ... and are the Democrats just hiding behind their new found a hero\nFor them a Joe ... is one of those a media columnist from the hill and host of what America is thinking on a hill TV Joe welcome to the program\nFlies I think this is my first time on with your correct\nI it is your first time on and and you're very welcome to be here we rely on the hill a lot you folks do a fairly good job in fairly down the middle on like a few other publications on line that I might mention like the ... and the New York times\nUh yeah that makes us an anomaly at this point which is kinda scary right but I I appreciate it I'm Glad that check there but I said but ...\nYeah well I Would just imagine Joe what'd you God is you have the potential to talk to both sides and that's twice as big or group is just talking to one side I mean if you're if you're somebody who's in the media business don't you want to sell to both sides of the aisle including Republican or you know the low forehead a Neanderthal types like me\nAs well as the leap elite types who read the New York times\nOver there ah there there are a lot of the\nWorld from a journalism perspective ah our stories are shared the most by Republicans and Democrats you know most of the time when you were talking about members of Congress\nSo you know a lot of members of Congress will just share you know if you're conservative Breitbart or Fox News or ... from there or whatever but and then Democrats obviously will do MSNBC CNN and so on but a ... with us we we could share the most from both sides that's good but from a business perspective ... exactly a great point\nWhich is yeah wouldn't get make more money at a wider audience a bigger net so yeah or editorial page goes left and right which is fine we we have opinions from both sides\nAnd that our our reporting straight down the middle and that that's the way everybody should should go about their business but uh it's certainly an anomaly and then the exception rather than the rule\nIt also seems odd to that in the coverage of judge Kavanaugh usually reporters are a bit skeptical about just about everything especially claims that you know you can't\nProve absolutely and and yet I've seen a lot of skepticism go right out the window that\nIf it's if it's Christine Ford making the allegation it must be true after all she says this was done to her thirty six years ago even though she can't remember the details whereas judge Kavanaugh\nHe's just a big heavy drinking loud who was apparently involved in a legit rape parties at one point that also stayed secret for the last third of a century you find that believable don't you\nI mean I I think this is one of the worst moments at our media is that a lot of\nBad moments political maybe I'm Talking about specifically a and ever since the president took office obviously during the two thousand six team but I Can't remember it being as bad as we're seeing it now and I always just kind of put it to this question\nIf this was a Democratic president who nominated a loophole for third nomination for the Supreme Court would we see\nEven the Christine forward story getting any legs whatsoever because to your point\nDoesn't do what had happened where it happened how she got home or she's contradict yourself on a couple of occasions in terms of I'm too afraid to fly I Can't testify in this day and it turns out that you know she flies a lot I mean a little thing that you could say well that's just a little thing big deal but\nHey I mean that goes to credibility and then the stories that we have today Lars like Brett Kavanaugh was involved in a bar fight\nA veil and Nineteen eighty five and he threw ice it somebody I mean well\nFor for for starters he's a genius because when you think about it the weapon destroys itself right I mean\nI like it out like a like an ice bullet well and the other thing is finding kids in college who drink beer on Friday nights and sometimes get into either ice fights or food fights is probably not that difficult is it\nI'm One of them [laughter] I just couldn't\nA food fight at Boston College my uh my freshman year I wasn't going Arizona Emerson College in Boston but\nI was visiting some friends that I did start one that is true and yes a later at my senior year I did pour a picture of beer over another friend at a free beer festival type of thing and yet I mean this is what you do it's ... use this is all part of it but I think now the goalposts moved so much on this that\nIt seems that Democrats and partisans in the media seemed to be making the argument that if Brett Kavanaugh lied about how much he drank in college than he that disqualifies him for the Supreme Court okay so that means that Beto O'Rourke who is running for the Senate in taxes against Ted Cruz Jeb who had a DUI\nAnd reportedly left the scene of that accident or when he was Nineteen and college\nWrote a paper about the the ... and ... and ... of of women of actresses a play that means he's disqualified and then I can go right down the list of Ninety eight percent of of the of the Senate and Congress where people will be disqualified based on the new rules\nThat are being presented it is a dangerous precedent that we're seeing here and I think that's why people are so invested bars in in Kavanaugh getting confirmed not because he's a conservative and you want to have another conservative on the court and gay in terms of ideology it's\nAbout principle that if you allow these tactics to work here they\nNo sane person able ever going to public service and be you'll never ever be able to get somebody of approved onto the Supreme Court again because you could go back and find one thing from their past and not even have a corroborated\nOr any evidence around it and that'll be enough to dismiss that person and destroy their life in the process that's why people are so invested 'cause they know what the stakes are here and it's scary\nI'm Talking to a joke Congo who's a media columnist for the hill and Joe I find a job that this was just made for you as a media columnist to get a question like this from my see CNN and you know chicken noodle news network talking to the wonderful crazy Mazie Hirono of Hawaii\nDo you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone who's been in the Supreme\nCourt by the way he's in this in that case is the ice fight [noise]\nRemarried and had the I mean there are a lot of allegations and I mean part of LA are about how he behaves rainy and\nNow this is crazy\nYou've actually got in the media serious journalists supposedly had CNN saying does this ice thing disqualify him from the Supreme Court and Mazie Hirono quote a cooperate by saying yes this is why we need the FBI to look into this because of allegations like an ice fight with Chris Dudley at a bar in Connecticut\nRight and and then when this investigation is wrapped up and it's being reported tonight the wall Street Journal that this could very easily be done by tomorrow morning this FBI investigation because again\nThere's the ... ... if you can investigate something where you don't know what time or a place of where the\nUh the board the event happened or no one can corroborate it so they interviewed a couple of people and they got through that will present their findings to the Senate and the and of course the Democratic side will leak out those findings a breath I can guarantee you that\nAh but yeah and then and then uh that senator from Hawaii will then say you know obviously this was a rushed FBI investigation we needed something larger\nAnd scope and throwing them never be satisfied with this but this boat has to happen soon because the ... of the world and I call them ... because he is like a ... really where he has no talented you see him on TV Everywhere\nSays something else will come out that will be completely and totally unfounded just to muddy the waters more an even if Kavanaugh gets confirmed bars by the way the Democrats have one here they won the dirtiest way possible\nBut but they've painted the GOP now as anti me too and Taiwan then and it's just such a shame that that people actually believe any of these out\nEvidence around all three of them particularly the ... and yet he can can you can airtime because no one wants to challenge him on basic facts\nJoe this is what makes your column well worth reading all the time and I just I've been telling my audience I've been having fun with this as well because it is kind of absurd it's like all the writers from Saturday Night live left SNL and you can tell and they all went to work as staffers on Capitol Hill but I've been telling them do you want your son\nYour brother your father your husband to be subject to this kind of as the president framed it today you are guilty until you prove what you didn't do which I keep reminding people proving what you did do is sometimes easy proving what you've never done is\nDown in city in it on a\nBy all the way down from ... ... drivers to ... to ... uh to ordinary people in the streets and this has been going on for quite some time now and the best change in the best revolution comes when people rise up against an oppressive regime or does a fuss on the outside\nCan only support them by saying that you know we are with you and of course as I said a\nDoes western countries European countries who are still continuing to do business with Iran should also think twice about a continuing to do business with a country that has such a great human rights violations not because I say so but because it's all been documented or an amnesty reports and\nYou ah watch and monitor ... across them go\nSee because that's the part where he'll that's perhaps the hardest for a lot of us to understand and that is the United states says Iran is a\nMajor state sponsor of terrorism the biggest state sponsor of terrorism on the globe and we say we should we should bring these people in the line or as members of the world community I mean I I'm not for global movement or anything like that but I\nI think that when there are potential threat to the United states and when they have this kind of record with their own people end up sponsoring terrorist acts in their own region which are potential threats to the United states\nUh when when you know if you get disruption in that region it could cause problems all over the world\nWhy are the Europeans not climbing on board that and saying you're right these people are bad people are they just so focused these countries that want to do business with Iran on saying well but they got they got dollars because Obama gave as you said given the dollars and we'd like to sell them stuff\nYes and they got dollars and they've got yeah so you know that relationship it that that is such a relationship and the bottom of the mind when you think about this and that you also mentioned that they don't sponsor\nTerrorism just within their own country for a sponsor the Hamas and has a lot of site did they find a militia yet\nA tighter feed on and that is why they're so dangerous so the money that says that down went into the coffers of the I have to live in the gym and was used\nSponsor their militias abroad and to\nA sponsor that it isn't so uh\nYou know I I I also have this question in just a minute why are some western leaders European countries will continue to ...\nBut it has to do business with them but then as I said this is a whole other ball game you know it's about money about oil it's about a lot of money\nThat comes to the real issue here and that you know the amount of money we're talking about people sell their souls for it so they\nThey put aside the idea that they are violations taking place a when these countries are part of the human rights council they go there they know that the violation steak place because it's all\nA documented in black and white um but I'm a credited with the United Nations Human rights council for five years as his dad and I met the victims I met the dissidents and he knows that he's probably still exist and so do the European leaders\nBut uh you know this is how the world works and it's unfortunate\nI mean it does if there wasn't enough pressure\nThat would be a change for\nMe because you know for instance one of the conditions of leadership of membership in the ... you is that you drop the death penalty domestically so all the European countries while there is support for the death penalty among the population of Western European countries the countries themselves have given up on the death penalty\nOr and said we will not do it because you have to you have to not do this so the same folks who won't have the death penalty for the most heinous crimes in their own country tolerate doing business with a bunch of people who have far worse than that I thought he was you said beating people to death and they're prisons\nAnd and the ... and you say it's wrong for us to have the death penalty because we're such good moral people but it's okay for us to do business because of the cash involved with a bunch of people who will be their own and torture their own people to death that doesn't mean that it's making me have cognitive dissonance\nIt's ironic isn't it and you know here I Am I ... ... human rights activist I win women's rights activists but you know whether it's to me too movement in the women's march in terms of ...\nHe trained Eighteen I stick and tortured and jailed it's called the day I mean again it just boggles the mind that look at the ... the ... and look at the time they're living in ... and yet I'm I'm\n...

D welcome to the program\n... thank you very much a large I really appreciate being All right\nSo when people talk about oil and about energy and about ways to make sure that they have the money they need when they hit retirement age is that a good place for people to be above parking their money\nIt would be larger it really depends on the company and what they're trying to accomplish there are a lot of smaller oil companies that are doing very very well in West Texas ... especially as it you're probably aware of the west Texas a\nCrude is probably the number one all in the maybe the ... you brought up to it but there's a lot of small companies that are that if\nI Would say good investment opportunity I'm not so big on the larger companies because you really can't control what they do but you're invested some of the smaller companies by the way you can buy stock in those things to really you can almost into what you're doing and what's your investments doing right now\nIn other words if you buy an Exxon or BP or one of the larger majors you're just going to be one more little fish in that big pond but if they're buying stock in a small company did she did\nUnder the actual wells are not drilled by the big guys are built drove by the little guys right\nThat's exactly correct to the small companies are are are\nLeasing themselves out to the larger companies\nAnd the large companies really don't care about the little guy I always\nTell my clients so they'll come in and say you know Warren Buffett said great investor and I say no one rough it's a great buyer because he can afford to buy into the ... and he can control what he does because he can buy stock to make their control\nBut the little guy can't do that like most of my class for not the kind of investors obviously but what I tell them is supposed to take a look at the small guys take a look at what they're doing right now we've got oil contracts\nDrilling contract for some of these small\nCompanies that go out three and four years in the future\nBecause of the price of oil and the way all is being found you know we are now the number one\nOil producer in the world is you're aware of the United

put their money for what it's doing for them and if they're having to watch that on a regular basis in fact are losing sleep over it because\nThey're reading what the big guys say and what the stock market's doing and what some of the pundits are saying uh Ben Stein just came out with an article in ... just a couple of days ago talking about three things that you gotta watch out there is going to be a bus coming up for those kind of things will panic the average guy and what they end up doing is letting their investments on them they are afraid to get in\nAnd then when they get in their right to get out so the reason I wrote the book for those people as hey there's other ways to look for things there's ways to invest for income as opposed to growth\nAnd a lot of my clients are of age they're really not so concerned about making that money they made it already now they want to make sure they tape it and they have it when they get ready to retire and for as long as they live\nSo how do you go about doing that without losing it all because I get worried when I see people parking all of their investments in one place one small area and and that sounds like a bit of what your suggestion when you say you can own stock in a small oil driller to actually\nBe in control so that means you may have a lot of your your net worth parked in that one little company run\nAds and as a matter of fact I don't do that I tell them up front or said you do not want to put it all in one place what you want to do is still diversify but you want to do the evaluation or have someone\nThat's a professional that is involved with this thing on the day to day basis that will do the evaluations for you someone that you can trust in fact if you'll notice in their large I've got a page I think it's ...\nTwo hundred and two I quoted there's so many times\nThat actually gives you ten questions you should ask your advisor and one of those questions is if I\nPut my money into places that will provide income as opposed to growth and still get a good return can you provide me that kind of investments as well and obviously what you try to do is give the client the best possible return they can get some of it and grow some of it and income\nBut as they get older as you are quite aware as they get older they should really be a little bit more conservative in what they're doing and that's what we try to do here in West Texas we don't mind them going after the oil companies we think that's a good opportunity for some of them but not for everyone\nBecause her an awful lot of people who've hit retirement age or they're getting close to it or they're already in it\nThey're not too concerned with buying stock and then holding it for Twenty years I mean to be honest some of them may not be around in Twenty years they're already of a certain age but what they want is something that will make crude produces a solid stream so they can pay their bills and enjoy life\n[noise] catching does actually when I wrote the book and when I said to let your not let your investments on you I Want to my clients to enjoy what they're doing\nBe able to go to bed at night and sleep well not worrying about the fact that the market to come down tomorrow and it very well could get on the situation as you are very well aware and I listen to your program a number of times and I really appreciate that advice that you gave us some others that have been on the show\nThat the market is strange it goes up it goes down and we've been out for a long time\nThings could really get kinky around here so I tell people all the time you really need to watch where you're going especially if you're getting close to that age where you're Seventy Seventy five in that area you would outlive all on the market goes down for another ten years and then what do you do your income is gone\nYou may have to go back or it can be a greeter at Wal Mart if you're not careful\nYeah well I think all of it was worried about that but let me ask you this do you worry about those folks who politically seem to hate oil with a passion see I I think it's a great fuel and no it is because I Am so much punch\nThe there's a reason that a twenty gallon gas tank all will push it you know several hundred miles down the road\nAnd that they haven't been able to come up with something that is really the electric alternative or even the natural gas alternatives so I think the fuel is going to be around a long time unless you got a bunch of the political types like Hillary would promise to shut down every kind of fossil fuel that you can turn the off switch to and and and I'm not worried about that\nWell I we we were concerned about it from the standpoint of the politicians they try to get on the other side but they're also going to lose their buttons they're going to lose a whole lot of the things that the petroleum does that not all\nBased on the automobile I mean there are so many things you throw your product produce that electric cars can't do and that and the windmills out here yeah we've got to win that you can drive into El Paso Texas Texas drive a car drive across the state and I promise you ...\nYou will always be one of these giant windmills running the area I seriously all the way and also all the way across\nTexas nine hundred miles you're stuck with wind males\nThey produce two percent two percent of the sum of money to protect it to the grid they're just popped up their heads will going around in circles and making it I think\nUh we we just laugh about that in West Texas we know what the basis for the economy is we know what it will do and if they want to have it all companies that's one thing but they sure do use a lot of oil based products out there that if they if we didn't have the all companies\nIt may not run but they couldn't button their shirt either their parents as far as that's concerned because everything's made while\nI'm Talking to de Carter who's the author most recently of it is now or never around to enjoy your life and not let your investments on you you do I don't know whether you're ... you probably do agree with me based on what you said but\nYou know the those windmills irritate me because I Know that Texas has its own little interesting scheme on electricity weren't can't really be sold out of the state\nAnd so there are literally been times where people have sold electricity for less than than zero where they've actually\nPale absolutely because and if people say why would you sell something for lessons you're on the answer is because the tax\nIncentives the subsidies are attached to it make it worth selling for two dollars a ... megawatt less than one what is what does it mean to a negative two dollars that is you'll pay somebody to take it off their hands or check out the motives Sally Ride it's now\nOr never the it's a pleasure to have you on the program we'll have you back some time\nTerrorists that complicated customs clumps shop online and Kevin up from the U.S they've they've boosted that now but not to a great number but it's forty dollars and so that's twice as large so that's that's a that's a good thing there's a chapter on currency\nCountries are supposed to leave their countries Canada and Mexico weren't doing it but that say hey marker for agreements with other countries that that would be a obviously China if we ever had an agreement with them but other countries as well so there there's a lot of you know these are what I Would call\nA quite a quite good and positive steps\nOr you're going to go to the negative\nWell before we get to the negatives I Want to know you mentioned China and I want to know whether or not this is going to have a side benefit of sending a message to China\nThat when we come to do business with them and renegotiate our deals with China because they're not involved in is that that they will get a message of how the United states wants to do business is that going to have the desired result\nWell it certainly carries that signal you're absolutely right I mean I carried a very strong signal and doubt whether China will\nChange its economic a model at least in some respects to become more of a market oriented bottle that remains to be seen but to signal\nCould not be clear show yes I agree with the rest of your your questioner no doubt that it was what to say to China but the rest of the world for example talked with the Philippines are going on and some African countries and so forth\nWill they take it seriously\n[noise] well China is the big question mark my predicts do better than yours odd the Chinese economy is slowing down partly because of the trade friction\nBut they will take it very seriously they see the Catholic this new agreement and I know which you know it's a very long it's a thousand pages a lot of text and a lot of details but this is now the template for any trade agreement that the Trump Administration sides with\nAny other country and got the key key provisions where they they don't let them that they want to go forward they will recognize Adam so that's part of Japan were wherever we talked with Japan which have just gotten\nWell professor now let's go to the negative what's the downside to us and two year\nOkay there's no uh it it just and I want to emphasize these are my mind my by my metric bigger negative\nAnd positive but they're very small compared to the fears before we went was you know concluded on Sunday night a closely I'm not a fan of managed trade centers that if you like managed trade you liked disagreement show their big\nBig guy he managed trade in the automotive sector which don't have any impact now but the agreement is meant to go for sixteen years with a six year review and in that period of time they may very well\nRun up against the law that's also in a textiles and a pill they're more of a managed trade flavor also ah which I don't like is that a government put kill them like between us and Canada\nIs no longer open to the companies or the other countries by this agreement it might be open to countries want but they're they're not committed to and I I like competition for government for journalists to either get 'cause better quality a lower price to have you\nBack or not a fan of uh managed trade either although I certainly understand why the concerns that are there that when you say we're going to let automobiles come in from places in North America Mexico and Canada ah that that we want to control the amount of content that's in them and that sort of thing I understand the concerns people have because\nIf you said what's the cheapest place on earth to make automobiles it probably wouldn't be the high tax and regulation environment of the United states well before you even get to labor cause\nWell well you you might be right back to us and while I Would say north of that are taken as a year is a very low cost producers hold an awful lot of vehicles large trucks pick up trucks and in a dog\nAnd lead you as you get used for sure maybe not small automobiles I Would agree with you there is a smaller called that cause but the rest were very cost competitive thanks to these are quite ... years and elaborate supply chains with chronic clause north of ... the producer early part\nIn a place to go to college and\nSo and it's awfully tough to do it anywhere else professor I very much appreciate the correction and I appreciate you come\nAnd gone with the coming up and just a moment when you go out
