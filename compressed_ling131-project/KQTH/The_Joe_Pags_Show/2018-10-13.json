it's Chris wires don't forget marshals\nOn right after Tucson morning news suffer no serious moral ...\nOne of the biggest international stories it's been a Washington Post journalist who went missing after entering a Saudi consulate in his than ball\nAnd the problem is that we now believe that he's been killed and that the Saudis knew about it and not only knew about it but participated in it I've been ... by a writer sparrow to join me known worldwide as America's rabbi Middle East observer and a political analyst rabbi welcome to the program and thanks for taking the time tonight\nWell thank you it's good to be with you Lars\nWhat has happened to Jamal ...\nWell I don't know any more than you know but he's not here that's for sure\nAnd uh how he was a done away with well nobody's exactly sure although there are ... there are some indications but uh I don't think he's alive he's he's certainly not alive or how he met his death that's that's a question\nAnd I'm but I'm sure that people like Mike bump pay or John Bolton I'm Jared Kushner look at the bottom of all this\nTell me this\nYou know we've at least heard suggestions that there's video and perhaps audiotape or that indicates that he was actually murdered by the Saudis we don't know and I imagine you'll say we don't know for sure but do we have really good reason to suspect that the Saudis who are officially our allies may have murdered this journalist\nAnd if they have how what should America answer that with\n... they may have ... we'll find out I'm not normally I'm not a great fan of turkey especially under aired again\nI'm reading but will will eventually find out but I'm Glad you asked the other question because there are some people suggesting that well if the Saudis did do this that we should have cancel all deals we have with\nTelling them ammunition and planes and the equipment I I Would go that far I mean listen they're going to get them from the Chinese will get them from the Russians\nAnd I think we have to make a distinction between let's say a regime\nThat did kill or someone that they wanted to get rid of and this happens quite often it's really different than the regime that would be involved in the wholesale genocide killing of people wholesale oppression\nBecause if we're going to set the standard so high that any nation that through a kills this particular spy or that particular prisoner they want this one knocked off which happens with many many nations\nWell the American people are going to suffer because then we'll have to we won't be able to sell people defense equipment or farm equipment or cold you know listen to the Chinese do things to and yet we we sell them cold so it it's one thing if there is a government that's involved in the wholesale genocide well there's a certain moral principle there\nBut um if they kill someone because they consider that person to spy yet we don't like they do that but\nWe can't punish ourselves entire industry is that I don't think that would be moral either why should a fellow who was in ... in in western Pennsylvania and the cold business why should he now not have an income for his family because some internal Saudi thing or some internal Chinese then why should he lose his job over there\nAnd rabbi might be a bit hypocritical don't you imagine that our government truth be told occasionally kills people are in various places for reasons that they may not be able to even tell the American public about\nYeah well I'm not [laughter] gonna admit to that [laughter] that but\nThe the the best of countries are sometimes um when it comes to certain\n[laughter] it\nEven the the the\nBest of countries are sometimes um when it comes to certain individual people that they feel it may have been a spy or a mole 'em or you know a lot of these things these deep deep CIA type of things that we have no way of knowing ever really\nUm so we know these things happen but like I said there's a big difference but before we punish entire industries which we always have to translate that into people there are people all throughout West Virginia and and southern Pennsylvania northeast Pennsylvania that depend on\nA thriving coal business really depends on China or what are we gonna do put everybody out of business and then everybody in the\nBoeing they can sell anything so what's that going to do to a parts of they have employees in Seattle they haven't Chicago they've got down on the Carolinas the farmers are working at all the farmers in Iowa in Kansas though I I think that\nI was hoping you were going to ask that question because we've got to make a distinction between a country that's involved in the wholesale genocide versus all this stuff that has to do with spies and I'll tell you one more thing I Do feel this if this would not be a reporter\nAnd he happened to work for the Washington Post I don't know that they'd be such an outcry all over the world about this in the western media it's one of their own\nAs opposed to let's say some businessmen was knocked off for some reason we hear about it but I don't think it would rise to this level this is this is a journalist so you expect the press to make a a a very strong case at monumental cases if we're supposed to know several relations\nRabbi I'm Talking to rabbi a real sparrow who's known as worldwide as America's rabbi he's also the author of pushback reclaiming our American Judeo Christian eat those the other thing you mentioned just in passing or you you you brush them across was the issue of pushing them into somebody else's orbit and that is if you say well we'll cut off the Saudis\nWell I'm sure that the Russians and the Chinese would love to have an opportunity to bring Saudi Arabia into their orbit and you know what I mean rather than having them be uh you know a a country that at least\nA you know that they have helped us out in both of the Gulf wars and in other situations and currently may appear to be a you know they appear to be doing pretty well in in in broadening relations let's say with Israel which is is not a bad thing in the middle east we need our allies in that region don't we\nKnow that that's a very important point you make the size the economic aspect of it and they use the word orbit if we're not going to be selling these things to Saudi Arabia and China and Russia will\nWill not just lose the economic part of it but that's the word orbit politically they will no longer consider us and allied\nThey might align themselves with Russia with China and what that would do to the foreign\nPolicy the necessities of America a that would just that could crush the world that is something that I just don't think that however drastic this is under certainly terrible for the family and\nI'm sure that journalists were afraid but I really wouldn't turn the world upside down over an out and who knows what it could lead to what type of brink\nOf war this could then realignment of powers I wouldn't do that over this one incident no\nAnd and your you know it's funny rabbi because I'm a big supporter of Israel is imagine you are as well and Iran is one of the primary forces against Israel funding all kinds of terrorist activities uh you know through Syria and other places against Israel I'm sure the Iranians would love it too if the United states did not have this major ally in the ...\nThese uh you know through Syria and other places against Israel\nI'm sure the Iranians would love it too if the United states did not have this major ally of the Saudis because that means the United states' ability to push back against Iran or is also going to be impeded if we don't have those allies and I'm I I look rabbi I also have questions about some of the\nSaudis role in some things that haven't been as good for the United states as well I don't see them is entirely on our side but on the other hand I'd rather have them well like Reagan used to say my ... my eighty percent a friend who is not my twenty percent enemy\nOr you you can't run things that way and if you decide on absolutes you kill a journalist we cut you off altogether you're going to end up with no friends at all\n[noise] you know that's an important point I bet you you're going to hear the coming days people on the left\nNumber one wants to see Trump's foreign policy just disintegrate they want to see failure\nAnd certainly they would like Israel to lose a an important ally that they have now in Saudi Arabia but primarily they would like to see a collapse of all of what President Trump has done in the last two years they'll be calling in the name of morality for a a severe cut off all relations with Saudi Arabia\nIt was all over the place and and mentally unstable but I don't believe he is that way even though he admitted to buy polish ship and even though they last like Don Lemon look we're saying he has a mental problem and he needs to take care of him so\nI think he did it because people like you are right wing talking heads with this thing is like the his defense is\nIs fake Lucy's\nRally because there's no ... um do you would totally bonkers\nSee I don't think he was I Know isn't too well okay you've asserted that let me make the argument to the counter All right\nThat okay with you yeah sure I'm okay I Know\nI could interject before you do I like the ... thing in the ... as feathers and that is the best route should it should be a complete\n... and he is not in hold on hold on to talk on take a breath and I'm going to respond and I'll put you on hold if I have to here's my answer directly to that point which you interrupted\nThere are a lot of people I Know who communicate is kind of a stream of consciousness and one of them who I've mad and I admire greatly is Donald Trump if you listen to his speeches he will often start on one tack\nHe'll go to something else that may seem unrelated then they'll go to something else then I'd go to something else\nIt can be difficult to follow up but I think that's a style and and it's something that people do and I don't honestly think\nThey have a lot of control over it I can do the same thing sometimes I find myself down the rabbit hole because all start on tax policy I'll go to drug policy I'll go to talking about the wall and then and and if you're planning it well\nThen you may end up all the way wrapped around to something else like defense policy it happens\nThere are other times where I think in a very linear manner and I go from eight to beat to see and if I keep going all end up and see that's what you're saying is that somebody is crazy if they don't communicate in an entirely linear way in all instances\nI Will tell you something having sat in that same office not with President Trump although I Hope to one of these days but if you've never been in the oval office you don't know how totally intimidating it can be and I would imagine even for a guy who's used to performing like Kanye West does\nThat would be an intimidating experience you're in the oval office with the president you're surrounded by what looks like about six doesn't [noise] Loughner's cameras and everything else and then you say\nGosh he didn't seem to be speaking from a set of notes or on a strict outline and he started at a and ended up at L. and then went back to see and went off dizzy and came back to ... am and Opie you know that that if the fact that he wasn't going in a straight line shows he's crazy\nThen unfortunately an awful lot of us are probably crazy as well there are people and I know that some people I Know who are very smart\nWho don't always talk in a linear fashion one of them is one of my best friends over forty years he's a prosecutor he's very smart\nBut he will sometimes start with one thing and they'll end up going down a rabbit hole and I will confess to having done it as well so given that and don't decide that he's crazy if you sit\nTo start with one thing and they'll end up going down a rabbit hole and I will confess to having done it as well so given that and don't decide these crazy if you sit down and do what I Would encourage people to do and I've said this a few times today\nListen to what he said\nTo where he talked about the lack of father figures in families and that's something that's not a black or white issue it is an issue for all families if you don't have a father figure in that family and they're very many households this is not disparaging single mothers raising kids it's a tough job to do\nBut without a male figure there those kids miss out on something important and often times end up going off the path he went from that to welfare and its influence\nI think an awful lot of what he said was actually very very conservative and that's why the media is going nuts on it let's go to Douglas and Douglas welcome to First Amendment product what's on your mind\n[noise] hey Lars how you doing quite well what's that

and I want to know how you think ...

election jak nascent buying coverage online anytime at one oh four one K. U. P. H. dot com [noise]\n\nHonestly provided\nHave welcome back to the Mars Mars joys of First Amendment friday and I decided to visit with my friend Dr\nHenry Miller who's a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute he's published in the popular press\nAnd its scholarly journals as well a dock it's good to have you back welcome to the program\nCredit to be with your Lawrence thank you\nBefore we get into this discussion about dark regulatory matter would you mind telling my audience what dark regulatory matter is\nYeah well you know dark matter is often referred to as a the set of tools\nThat the so called deep state or dark state choose to carry out their own agendas sometimes independent of the intention of Congress or the administration that they're supposed to be working for\nAnd I'm In the context of a regulatory agencies there are several kinds of of dark matter of ways that they can get around the a specified procedures for\nCarrying out their work so I'm One example is um regulatory discretion and and that means that um they have discretion within what the law dictates that regulated industry or individuals\nMuch too and at the the most egregious example of that with which\nYour listeners will be familiar was a then FBI Director ... a decision an announcement that I'm Hillary Clinton's transgressions with respect to a ... ... email a private ... her private email server and so on\nDid not meet the criteria for prosecution in his opinion so that was discretion about whether there should be enforcement of the rules about the classified handling classified information um but there there are all sorts of examples in the in the regular\nRules about the classify handling classified information [noise] um but there there are all sorts of examples in the in the regulatory community so um [noise]\nUh for example a marijuana possession is still a federal crime and yet it's not prosecuted at all in a amounts per individual use in states like Colorado and California so there is a good example of federal enforcement discretion better runs well\n... ... ... but at least they're they have I think it is it called the Golan agreement there was actually drawn by Obama that effectively said\nAll right the U.S department of justice will ignore this violation of federal law by these stage even though the drug is illegal federally will agree to not enforce it because the people in your state of agreed to make it legal for either ... medical or a or a a recreational use\nBut at least that was committed to a piece of paper so you could point to it and said that's what the agreement says it also says\nThe agreement is null and void at the state allows a large amounts of contraband pot to be shipped out of state into other states that have not agreed to legalize it so at least those states get some protection\nBut does some of this regulatory dark matter also happened where discretion is used and there's no way to actually say well what is this additional discretion\nUh well it's it's as much as we decided to give whenever we decided to give it\nYeah well yeah and that's and that's the problem a set of that I'm\nA ... FDA for example or does this\nAll the time and it had a good example is another kind of regulatory dark matter it it is a pack up a little bit of a second kind of regulatory dark matter is the issuance of guidance documents or memoranda were announcements instead of formal role making\nFormal role mimicking specifies that there has to be an\nAnnouncement on the federal register public comment consideration of public comment and then finally station of the of the rule\nBut the agencies often get around that by issuing guidance documents and then uh within the uh the guidance that they specify\nWhich is often new policy making new law making\nThat really wasn't contemplated by Congress they can specify caught carve outs or enforcement discretion within that and that's a sometimes at a bridge too far too much autonomy that was never contemplated for\nA Fort regulatory agencies and yet they do this\nThey do this all the time some guidance is good so that for example if the uh as the food truck in costs medical law act says uh there has to be a pre approval\nInspections of drug manufacturing a suitable manufacturing facilities but uh but guidance documents can tell the industry\nWhat the nature of those are in a tablet Schmidt\nInspections will be do they have to be announced can they be unannounced are they supposed to avoid disrupting the pharmaceutical production\nUh how long should they last ah quite should be the outcome on in terms of paperwork and so on so that's good but uh but sometimes guidance makes brand new policy which is far beyond what anyone come and play\nIt and it wasn't that brings go ahead\nBrand new policy which is far beyond what any one little places\nAnd it wasn't that please go ahead do it\nAnd that and that brings up a sort of a conflict if you get regulatory agencies too much of a ton of money or you get them making new policies that are beyond what was intended if you get a little too little\nYou have a unable to adjust to situations new technology is new situations that might arise\nSo what's the best way of raining it in and and I guess well you tell me what you think the best way to rented in would be\nWell the best way to rein it in it as we've discussed in another context is for Congress to exercise and performance over of\n\nFederal paycheck out of the public trade for what the people of good faith\nAnd to some extent I imagine there are plenty of people who meet that description and then there are other people who seem to think\nMy federal job is not just a great paycheck integrate pension but his mind a license to go out and fix things to be the way I think they ought to be instead of the way that I'd been directed and I know that some of these people didn't like the choice of Donald Trump I frankly don't care I didn't like the choice of rock Obama\nBut I also didn't suggest that well if you didn't like rock Obama than you should work from within whatever agency you work in to try and sabotage his policies which I don't think I've done very much\nA but people are certainly saying I'm going to sabotage the policies of ah of Donald Trump and make sure that his policies don't happen and when they do that as far as I'm concerned there's sitting in the face of the voters who approved Donald Trump whether you like him or not he was the choice of this system that we have Dr Miller thank you very much like\nYour listen I got a break but I I really appreciate the time you can read about this a doctor or Miller has written about this extensively it I'd be de investors business daily and we always appreciate our visits with Dr\nDoc thanks very much and he's at the Pacific research Institute as well hey I Want to remind you something about sleep we're heading into fall it is getting colder there's more rain there's more adverse whether you need your sleep so how does a great night sleep improve your performance\nHow 'bout more energy less brain fog better mood and more productivity\nThe news sleep number three sixty smart bet that's the kind that TNN I sleep on helps everybody from parents to pro athletes to improve their daily performance through proven quality sleep my sleep number setting because it's sixty five Fifteen is is it thirty five or forty or forty five\nBut that's the beauty she can change her side I can change my side and so many couples disagree on mattress firmness will sleep number beds let you choose your ideal for this on each side so it's precisely right for both of you\nBrad Bird glad to her and I read them [laughter] and uh and this was called Google soups and I actually talked about the fact that they have access to of course all of our personal information\nAnd there are thousands of people do go and thousands of people who work at Google's business partners we have a have free access to our profiles our emails\nI mean how can they resist snooping they can't and now and then uh the employees have been caught doing very bad things with our data and of course we also now have a leak showing\nAn internal discussion among Google employees about how they can fight Donald Trump's or you know immigration policy of this isn't just from two thousand Seventeen so you know there there are people they're just people frankly and I think it's dangerous yeah\nI I guess Dr I Know they're just people but for example and I I really resist the idea that these should be turned into government government controlled utilities like\nA power company or a natural gas company I don't like that idea because I didn't get very quickly run up against the first amendment and I ... I Want to safeguard the first amendment for both the left and the ride even though I'm On the right\nBut I think and tell me if this comparison isn't isn't appropriate I have friends who are cops I don't even call them and say would you give me the criminal background on someone if it isn't public record already because I'm aware that the data systems they have access to would do that\nA background on someone if it isn't public record already because I'm aware that the data systems they have access to\nWould do that one is called the law enforcement data system you can plop and Dr Robert Epstein and find out how many wants and warrants arrests and all kinds of other really salacious information might be available but Epstein her Larson or anyone else\nAnd I'm aware that there are there legal constraints on that and I almost think there ought to be ethical constraints that are good cop\nShould say that data is for law enforcement only it is not for you know to be used by you to figure out whether your girlfriend has you know an arrest from ten years ago or potential employee does unless it is public information and all those people who work in police agencies\nSometimes they break the rules to but there are tough consequences when they do they say you're not supposed to be using the lead system for anything but law enforcement it's there for a reason to catch bad guys and bad gals\nBut it's not there for you to check on your boyfriend or your girlfriend now if we catch you're doing it it it's the end of your career is is Google prepared to be that tough on employees who who break those rules\nWell see there there's a big difference because you're talking about not just ethics you're talking about uh laws and regulations you're talking about accountability to the public\nAnd the problem is with Google Facebook to there are no laws there are no regulations and there's no accountability to the public there's accountability is chair of shareholders well or my you know my my views on this actually have changed I have to say over the years um\nI I used to start to think about regulations and things like that and uh I I my thinking has really changed\nA guarding the search engine itself for example\nI mean you you don't like the idea of a public utility but the search engine itself cannot be in private hands that's that's an index to all knowledge and that it not only that it's it's international so that can't possibly be in private hands we can't have\nA private company determining which you know ten items out of billions and billions you're going to see and in what order you're going to see them because that's the research I Do I show the power that they have to shift in thinking an opinion and votes and beliefs and purchases a you know through those kinds of\nAh choices they're making the filter and the ordering of information that cannot possibly be in private hands so we kind of case by case they are but yeah\nWe're gonna we're gonna hit a break here in a second and I take a break can you stick through the break for a moment because I Want to ask you about how we would go about controlling who control in it that'll Latin phrase who who's going to guard the guardians or in and do you mind sticking around for that\nI Will for you Yes sir\nThank is her doctor Robert Epstein is with me he's the author of the upcoming book techno slavery the invisible influence of the Internet age and beyond by the way\nYou know it's not smart jobs sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes you know what he is smart zipper could or dot com slash Lars unlike other jobs ... ... doesn't wait for candidates to find you zipper could or find some for you it's powerful matching technology\nScans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively\nInvites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast no more sorting through the wrong resumes no more waiting for the right candidates to apply no wonder the zipper critters rated number one by employers in the United states and right now my listeners can\nFries for free at this exclusive Web address zipper ... dot com slash large that different or dot com slashed\n... ... at this exclusive Web address zipper tutor dot com slash large that's different for the dot com slash L.

before they became president and then I'll give you the net worth of those individuals after they left the presidency Donald Trump came into the presidency with a net worth a four point five billion dollars\nRock Obama came in worth about three million largely a house in Chicago in a few other things and the Clintons came into the presidency Bill Clinton's presidency with less than half a million bucks in net worth I mean the fact is the Clinton family had spent most of his life\nIn public housing before that you know living in the governor's mansion in Arkansas and that sort of thing now compare that with today Trump comes in worth four point five billion today his estimated net worth is three billion dollars\nThirty percent lower one and a half billion dollars less now he's still president we don't know what's going to happen after his second term because I think he's going to get a second term Brock Obama came in with three million dollars net worth what's his net worth today\nForty million dollars Thirteen times as much money as he came in with the Clintons came in as I said worth less than half a million dollars they're estimated net worth today is a hundred million dollars to a hundred times what they came in with just consider\nIs Donald Trump the guy who's trying to steal your money or make things more unequal he's actually lost money by being president of the United states and not a small some\nOne and a half billion dollars so far and you say well he'll probably make it up later\nYou're all these stories about well he's he's got Saudi

Ga age [noise]\n\nWith them and friday night you know a few years ago Gina and I\nGot to do something that I had looked forward to the opportunity to do for a long long time but\nI got a chance to go down to Mississippi\nAnd try to help them and become a United States senator and it didn't happen that time and I think honestly the man was cheated out of an opportunity a by a senator who labeled himself a Republican but actually acted more like a Democrat\nWell Senator Chris McDaniel is back at it he is now a Mississippi State senator who is running for the United states and and he joins Mennonite a senator McDaniel state senator Mitch Daniels it's good to have you back on the program and uh I Want to see this one come out differently if you don't mind\nYeah absolutely and thank you for having a four years ago we we had that race and you remember what happened to ... we thought the good fight of the night of the primary we one fifty nine percent of the Republican vote but because of that again\nThey pushed forty thousand Democrat the typical public ... area of the Democrats elected our nominee and then as you don't have the establishment to work state topic just right for us to talk with to step down did they hand selected another Democrat for the seat so here we are\nBack in a very similar city fight here at the city so it's really great to be or\nWould you mind explained to my audience how it is this complicated the Mississippi ends up with the system in which Republicans can have their choices taken away from them by Democrats across the aisle\nYou know it's remarkable we help is very conservative state and all these joke of the campaign\nSince the United States Senate from Mississippi where are you going to find one it's not going to be from Massachusetts California it's good to safe but what happens here we have a large lobbying presents\nBecause of Haley Barbour and others at the party and\nThey will keep that gravy train ... what they do is they find a\nThese are so called Republicans who are really big government Republicans they believe it's ...\nIt's been dating in big tax scene in another liberal ... sales but they hide behind that are at the Mississippi over the years we've always managed to health conscious individual and yet we still remain\nDead last economically speaking so we're just in this another direction we think that this state can do better we know it can't just do away with the good old boy club with a lobbyist and the cronies and reimpose liberty for everybody and that's what we're trying to do\nSo how's the race going at this point what are the polls show\nVery well the polls are all over the place I mean I you know what do you do a poll I'm Donald Trump we told they told us he had an ... percent chance of losing anyone so uh some polls have us up a there's a pack poll shows us up eight to ten years or NBC poll shows us down five\nOther polls are being whispered about to shore up two or three\nWho knows what I Do know that we have all the momentum and the reason I Know that is we can feel the buzz on the ground and guess what will run against someone who was a life time Democrats you served three terms\nIn the states it as a Democrat she voted for Hillary Clinton has this all Democrats that grounded fact before she came back to Mississippi and ran for state Senate she was a federal lobbyist is she lobbied to heal organization that pushed for Obamacare and pushed for\nUniversal healthcare so when people find that out about the appointed senator guess what they rush away in droves and they run toward our campaign that's the only conservative and the great so as long as you're spread that message that people here in it where when it\nSo tell me that is a columnist recently said that your star is fading so tell me how you close the gap between now and election day\nWe got to drive a we have to drive interest obviously does upon ethical pulled up there uh there's also just a a a a personal individual component there where people have to talk to their neighbors and make phone calls and inspired Mississippi is get out to vote and I would disagree that the story stating\nThe establishment spent ... million dollars in negative I Can't speak it twenty fourteen\nThey had a billion dollars it at this time to be so Fifteen million dollars in negative money in a small state like Mississippi all to drive me away\nAnd what's the big problem I'm a conservative I'm trying to hold them accountable and they don't want to be held accountable I don't think my story's going anywhere as long as the people on a champion that wants to fight for him I'm going to be that guy\nTell me this do you think that the Kavanaugh hearings are going to have any kind of effect because I I understand that there were senators who they are a lot of the focus on Murkowski and flake and Collins and fast and and yet\nI also wondered about the effect that it was going to have when people and especially conservatives like Mississippi looked at those even if you were a Democrat and a bit conservative and you said gosh I don't want my son or daughter held to this kind of standard where a single false accusation with such\nThin evidence in it it was basically her story and her story largely incomplete I Wonder whether that's going to have any kind of effect on the electrodes Mississippi\nWell I Hope that it was a hope the people of our state come to the conclusion that the Democrats have gone completely I'm completely to the well the other words they works\nThat they are Democrat more radical than they are already frankly it's a dangerous party and if we don't find Republicans that can stand in that gap but not just Republicans conservatives that standard the gal to push back against that party will go lose this country so we always argue\nThe days of rigid across the aisle or over the days of chastened in the class to the left or over we have to stand in the Gallup they'll force this government back to the plight back toward liberty back where it belongs to lose this country so I Hope people\nRecognize how dangerous got party has become and how much we have to fight to preserve our way of life\nI'm Talking to a state senator Chris McDaniel who's running for the United States Senate from Mississippi so how can people help you out financially because I Know and he's closing weeks of the campaign a lot of money gets spent and often times like it or not money makes the difference because of advertising and get out the vote\nYes sir it's a big deal to she's out spin on us right now probably Fifteen to one\nShe's got all the ... money ... money in the U.S chamber of commerce but if I got here tried to save her we just need you to help us you guys out there listening\nMac Daniel twenty eight teams dot com go to Daniel twenty Eighteen dot com you'll see my plants all what I Believe in and if you get a chance please come help us Mississippi would love to have a conservative US Senator and I promise you will fight for everybody\nI of course one last thing and that is let's assume you become the next US Senator from the state of Mississippi I'd be pleased by that because I'd love to see you get there I I Know you've got the right values and and I I fully endorse your candidacy but but tell me the circuit in what are you going to be your top priorities is a brand newly minted US Senator\nI think number one we ... we have to build that border wall that has to be funded number two\nTerm limits it's just time to shock the system that brings up with these career politicians hole and lastly and every ... every speech that I feel we have to de centralized power of the federal government they're bringing those powers back to the states it back to the people with those powers always belonged\nThe government is broken sorry\n\nAgain and that's with every boat that we cast we have to restructure this government\nChris it's a pleasure I it was a pleasure to help your four years ago and my help wasn't nearly enough I Hope that this time the next time I talked to you after the November election that you are the next US Senator from Mississippi\nThank you so that means a lot and they just keep your prayers and a look forward to working we did get one day thank you for everything\nI look forward to a Senator Chris McDaniel is who is now a state senator running for the United States Senate blind to get your calls at eight six six say Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven and if you want to measure of where America is going right now\nConsider the me too movement consider the movements that openly opposed the choice of American voters in President Donald Trump and then consider this brand new poll reason magazine talks about it they asked Americans about political correctness now\nYou might get slightly different definitions of what political correctness is but I think we all understand it and it's like the old definition from the Supreme Court justice of obscenity I Can't find it but I Know it when I see it\nThis poll from reasons says eighty percent of Americans see political correctness as a problem now that suggests that an awful lot of the people who are the most politically\nHis ratings can be very good no they're not eight percent they're not twenty three three times higher they're thirty five percent more than four times the support he got at the polls and sixteen\nAnd I think the left has looked at that and said\nWe're in trouble we bones these voters or at least that's their attitude I think toward black American voters we own these people and they're they're going off the reservation they are now supporting Trump\nI mean what am I going to say when it goes from thirty five percent to say fifty percent by twenty twenty for the next election I think the Democratic party is going to lose its mind\n[noise] All right so I Want to give you some data points to arm the the number of votes that for that block Obama got a in two thousand eight and it's\n\nBeen approaching a higher and higher number from all the way from Ninety two to two thousand eight guess what\nWe've seen it go in the opposite direction rock Obama in two thousand twelve set a record for nominee among black voters actually it's true for everybody but he is the only president to be successfully reelected\nAnd receive fewer black votes than he did when he was first elected since Roosevelt\nYou name the candidate whether it was a Republican or Democrat they always managed to get more black voters the second time around what did those black voters no well here's what we got to see in two thousand sixteenth [noise]\nIf you just look at black men they gave Donald Trump third team per cent of their vote\nVoted the same way that black men did that would have been nearly a thirty year high the truth is we hadn't seen this divergence we didn't see it in two thousand twelve two thousand eight two thousand for this divergence\nYou gave me some stats that are accurate about the overall numbers there has been a spike among black men for Donald Trump and for rejecting progressive ism that most in the media aren't even wanting to talk about it has more than quadrupled\nWell and you can imagine the effect tours all of us I think react this way if if there's someone I highly respect\nWho comes out and says I'm In favor of something\nI'm not going to avoid the I I I Want to ignore the facts on the ground\nI don't always support what those I admire also support but it's the facts are there and you know right now the facts are pretty good black entrepreneurship for absolutely ... percent increase in the new black businesses in the last Eighteen months and then record low black unemployment and then a couple that with\nAdmirable figures for both black Americans and white Americans they ... they're going to be people who look and say well Connie likes the guy may maybe I should too and that may just pushing them over and I think that's what the Democrats are so concerned about that they are losing what they thought was a guaranteed piece of their electorate\nIt was the message that everyone was supposed to understand ... don't worry about what you said don't worry about what you feel just believe if the progressive socialist agenda is being pushed forward you're better off\nWell here's an interesting data point three of the five worst unemployment data points for blacks\nOccurred during the Obama administration guess what\nFive records for unemployment low is since the bureau of standards have been recording it within the department of labor\nFive have occurred of the lowest unemployment now we have set records in America for the number of people in just the last Eighteen months who went on their first ever they family vacation in a decade\nYou are not easily going to be able to convince black people that that doesn't matter and how do I know\nBecause Iraq Obama got fewer votes among black people when he was getting reelected they saw just like everyone else these policies don't appear to work\nNo they jumped horrors it's
