be with you on a First Amendment friday night\nYou know when we talk about the cabinet confirmation you wonder\nDo some of the young people who are following this especially those who are already of voting age do they have some you know basically firm grasp on what it is that's going on well documentary filmmaker army horror which is very good at taking the temperature of some of these people\nAnd he founded gullible ignorance well is really shocking when you documented out their army welcome back to the program how are you\nI'm doing well always a pleasure to be with you a large way\nBut I'm doing very well I'm doing much better after I saw that the vote tomorrow unless things change is going to be fifty one forty nine that we're going to see judge Kavanaugh confirmed I think he deserves it\nI think the president has the authority to appoint a Supreme Court justice and I think he picked a supremely qualified individual I'm Sorry that judge Kavanaugh on his family had to go through all this nonsense a story that we've we've finally come to find out was fraudulent ah and ended there were people willing\nTo urge others to lie to the FBI to back this up and I told the candidate the other day I should realize\nThis kind of bomb could be dropped on your candidate tomorrow was talking to a member of the staff of this campaign and I said what are you going to do if a work week out from election day\nThis kind of bomb has dropped on you and you know it's not true and you know you can probably prove it's not true but you won't be able to prove that in any way shape or form till after the election\nThis technique should not be used by either party I think it should be condemned if there's a a real person who's been harmed in assaulted more power to them their story should be heard but if you decided to simply drop a story knowing by the time they check it out and find out it's false\nOr the the election will be over and there's no way to undo it that's wrong so tell me about what you did with young people to try and find out of college kids find out their point of view on all this\n[noise] yeah well that's clearly a lot of opposition to to cabinet or on the left right no question about it and you you know the stories can continue to come out of the cabinet I did this and we went from you know he was a conservatives don't like them\nTo a is a gang rape spray like here is sixty yep so I Want to see what those two parts to it at first I wanted to find out what to what what they believe what idiocy can I make up their so obviously falls see if they believe\nThey're looking candidate for any office soy the Supreme Court\nOr delete so I began with with something I said you know\nA cabinet during the hearings he he felt that uh we needed to take a black man's value to be worth three fits the white man's value late and one of those are the things you could possibly imagine right right they're going to laugh myself out of here\nA lot of the old uh\nLives and what happened was when there was the faith in the south in the north to for to figure out on a census basis how many people you know what what what was the the um [noise] how many people were in North from the south in the country as a whole\nThere there was an agreement to count black people's three physical a white person because it was actually the north who pushed that because they didn't want the south of say well you know their slaves want to count them as citizens\nTherefore we'll have more people than the north less said she had a cave this week is compromise\nYeah so it has a reference in American history but it goes back a long long way there were actually college kids who believe that the the Kavanaugh are held that position that the black citizens were only three fifths of a person\n... every single person and then I Want to see if I get taught myself\nSo then I said well he also wants to take 'cause listen everybody is concerned that he's so dangerous to women's rights when you hear that all the time he is absolutely dangerous to women's rights so I wanted to see okay let's see how far they go to believe how how big a danger he wasn't even though he said that he thought that roe versus Wade was\nSupreme Court precedents and he wouldn't take that away they still didn't believe him and he was a danger to women's rights in general I said okay let me see how far we can take that and I said well did you know that he wanted to take a woman's right to vote away\n[laughter] of course nobody believes that Lawrence said\nWell except that they all believe that and not a single person of pushback and they all use it as an example to say why the terrible person\nThat's insane and these are not high school kids these are college age kids so they finished K through ... education they've been admitted to an American college they're supposed to be smart enough to study in college some of the people you talked to had a year or two in college and they still thought crazy things like that\nThat's right that's how much they're arrangement syndrome about Republicans in general are are that's how significant the situation is because they still want to believe that no matter what that how their way they are how how brainwashed they are when it comes to Americans and to what they think Republicans stand for\nWell and and I guess the really frightening thing for me is that\nThese people who consume mass media if they turn on CNN and and our MSNBC or read the New York times the Washington Post\nAh they will see stories that some of us said that is hogwash I can show you the documents that show you the thing that you just read in the Washington Post isn't true even NBC or got caught exaggerating some of what a Christine forward it had to say to Congress\nAnd they were called on it but if you don't know to call somebody on it or to go out and look it up yourself and see if that could possibly be true and you're used to consuming maybe two or three sources of media not double checking them you might be just completely taken for that or taken with that information\nNo question about it and by the way as crazy as that is that wasn't the most dangerous thing that they answered all of the most what was that what\nIt would it got worse was and I asked them okay so clearly you don't you know you don't want a Republican I get it why not let me ask you this question asked them to or questions I said what is what is the role what should be the role of Supreme Court\nShould it be what it actually is right now especially that to interpret the constitution or should they simply be promoters of social just\nWe all know there's only one answer to this question\nEvery single kid I add every still in critical professors their answer was promotion of social justice that is the role of the Supreme Court and then to take a step further to believe he's still can't believe we couldn't get a photo with this but we did I asked them\nIs the constitution even that was a team that you want to watch on suppressed of all the costs to show that comes Supreme Court on social justice so let's ask the question is well this doesn't have to you and the answer was for those people eighty percent of the kids I spoke to said it had no real well\nNo relevance even though on a daily basis they engage in free speech\nOr they are secure in their belongings the police can't just pull you out of your house and demand your papers as you walk down the street all of those things are things that are locked up in the constitution as safeguards against the government overreaching and doing things to citizens that the government should not be doing\nThey didn't see that relevance at all\nNo they didn't know I don't know\nI mean it's so disturbing it's hard to imagine it just it just it's so disturbing but that is true they did\nNot see the relevance whatsoever so I mean the real danger that was\nI Know the real proof is when people see this where can they see your work and and these examples\nSure they got on the dot com and it was right there for the city\nThat's am I ... I mean it's great to have you on the program things you're doing this because this is a great way to sample what do people know what do people believe at least in the case of this experiment\nHow much are they willing to believe even when it's so Felicia's that most of us would call it out immediately if we were asked a question like that good for you\nAlways a pleasure if they don't\nHave a wonderful weekend on me that Tommy Horwitz a journalist and documentary filmmaker I'm going to get to your phone calls immediately next why because we have\nThe fair assurance at this point that within about twenty four hours we're going to see the final votes for confirmation of America's latest Supreme Court justice and coming up Christians get a lot of flak lately but should they be barred from helping\nOne of them killed my mom so I have a reason personally to hate drunk drivers if you get a drunk driver in front of him and you're going to be in front of you are you going to throw the book at him\nThat judge if he or she is responsible judge will say I am not going to tell you ahead of you know not recuse they're not going to prejudge a case\nSo for instance if you ever saw a judge publically come out and say every time there's an issue of land rights which comes up in court frequently around America I'm always going to decide on behalf\nOf the landowner instead of the local government that may say they want to do something with a land if you say every time a case comes in front of me involving a worker who says he's been injured on the job I'm going to decide in favor of the worker\nThat judge should be off the bench and here's why and this is what judges have told me\nJudges should never take a position that pre judge is a kind of case so for example when you have met with almost all of them in this case from the Democratic party who say your honor do you take that roe versus Wade does establish law and you're not going to challenge it\nWell the thing is that is a pre judging a case that may come before the court\nIf you say your honor a if a if a man is suing the corporation you worked for will you side with the worker or the corporation\nHe should immediately refused and say I want to answer that because the minute you prejudged the case you're not a good judge anymore now almost all the things that the Democrats asked judge Kavanaugh about work questions like that\nSaying tell us promises that you won't overturn roe v way and they didn't say in those terms but they were trying to get him to take positions on things that almost guaranteed will come before the Supreme Court at some point in the next thirty or forty years\nAnd they wanted him to announce a head of time that he would take a position on cases that he hasn't even heard yet\nNow we don't want judges like that and I've just explain to you why does that explain why he had to give non answers to most of those questions because no judge should take a position on a case ahead of time not even your local\nJudges in your town or county should take a position ahead of time now does that make sense to\nOh yes you're you're a master debater of that uh I have been a master ...\n[laughter] yes I bet you are that are that the the question is why are all those eight look close and ah\nWhy why there's one word he won a secret word answers your question the word is abortion\nLost it solidly or during that that uh that session giving his testimony and so that that is why people say he does not have the ... and\nHold on and uh even daily pay somebody ... accused you of trying to rape a woman if somebody falsely accused you of that\nWould you have the kind of mild tone of voice there you have with me right now when you got dragged up in front of national television cameras and told prove to us that you didn't try to rape that girl thirty six years ago\nSo you've got an accusation that if people take it seriously and decide that you did this a third of a century ago your\nYour job is an appeals court judge go goes way and likely your entire law practice goes away you will never be employed as a lawyer you will never be employed as a judge if you are facing that kind of threat based on a false accusation what would your response ...\nYou be angry I I was I Would certainly be against it yes but uh how how harbored your what your talking about is not a re invited him back it's\nJust not the case I Know you've got something wrong and I'm going to correct you on it\nJudge Kavanaugh three days ago sent a letter to Harvard He usually goes there and teaches constitutional law every year and he informed him I Am not going to be available to teach constitutional law\nHe's going to be on the Supreme Court he doesn't have time to go teach college class at this point most of them do not I don't know of a single one of the justices the teachers even at the local D.C colleges or universities\nHow in the world with a guy who's sitting on the U.S Supreme Court have the time to go all the way up up to uh up to Harvard and teaches constitutional law cause he wasn't just invited he sent them the letter now I'm Glad I get a chance to straighten things out a\nLetter he sent them the letter\nAnd all you know there were people at Harvard who said we don't want him here now if you think that influenced is Troy said may have\nBut he's the one who decided I'm not working there\nAnd he won't have the time because after tomorrow about twenty four hours from now\nJudge Kavanaugh will be associate justice Brett Kavanaugh of the United States

Q. V. H. dot com [laughter]\nSo you go to the head of a low and Lars Larson giants right they do it eight six six eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com well given all the choices that us politicians have to make and\nRequired to take cognitive and psychological tests and I love the idea I'm not sure how practical it is or whether it's constitutional but Dr Henry Miller talked about it wrote about it\nAnd he's a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute and frankly a great asset to the show and a great friend of the show Dr Miller welcome back on\nThank you Ira it's great to be with you\nSo what do you think about the idea of requiring that elected officials and I'd take it from Capitol Hill out to every state legislature and maybe every city council and county commission is this practical\nWell to be clear I Am not suggesting that in the article that if the required I'm suggesting that politicians subject to its all entirely and that the vote if they don't or if they don't do it the voters punish them at the ballot box\nThat's er during free market approach to it isn't it\nI I think so so in the same way that we are like two or insist on a knowing whether open heart surgery was successful in a\nProminent politician or brain surgery more to the point um we we could do it for for just general or intelligence and mental status and psychopathology testing and so on I I think I think it has merit\nTo dock do you think that there are are there some tests out there for which we have enough of a you know sort of a baseline to know that the tests are reliable\nThat they don't create false positives either a ... tell us that somebody is a genius or false they tell us that somebody is a little on the crazy side where you might be able to say well if you take one of these it'll just help reassure the voters that you're doing All right\nAnd nobody has to be afraid is going to produce a result there's going to paint them as a lunatic\nYeah there there actually are some good ones and uh you know some of it is clearly subjective so when a psychiatrist or tries to measure or evaluate your fund of knowledge and your incite\nA and your intelligence and your memory that's that's all pretty subjective but psychologist had come have come up over the years with tests like the M. NPR Minnesota multi face a\nPersonality into tore a that consists\nIn its usual form of five hundred and sixty seven questions\nAnd that comes up with pretty good measures of ten a clinical parameters are like hyper hypo can dry SSN psycho pathology and belligerence and and so on as well as for a scales that ah that\nTend to shed light on the ... of the of the test so if you try to give them the answers you want\nNormal answers normal people answers or it can detect it because it asks questions in several different ways and a and looks for inconsistencies so I think I think there are pretty good ways to do that when the ... the tests are performed by professionals\nI use I took that one time and a couple of three decades ago because I Know it'd be interesting I kept hearing about the ... I'll take it is full of some very strange questions and you're right there is some hidden ways to test whether somebody is telling the truth or not or just trying to gain the result but you put forward the example of Pete Domenici first\nUh and the ... the idea that he came out and told the public look I've I've got this uh did degenerative disease or the wasting away the frontal and temporal lobes and he was nice to be honest with the public about what was going on\nBut it tests like that might have really reassured people or perhaps suggested to the member of Congress are centered\nBusiness doing the job anymore\nYeah I think that's an excellent example and you know another very topical one is uh of course we we all know that\nA Senator McCain recently passed away from a brain cancer and a arguably he really should have resigned a retired when uh the severity of that was discovered and think about where we would have been today\nWith the cats and North Korea confirmation if he had been in in his uh sick bat in Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote a that's a practical example of debilitate Asian uh that really arguably should have dictated resignation\nAnd by the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not something will be approved could hang on when the vote is taken in whether somebody's in town or out of town that sort of thing\nI suggested that in this day and age when you can buy a house in signed the mortgage documents and you know signed them electronically or send them you know over wire scanned them and then send them back\nThat are members of Congress should have the ability of voting electronically funny enough in their own chambers they do vote electronically but you have to be physically present in the Senate or physically present in the house to push the button or would it make sense\nIf say you know that there's a senator from Montana or deans who is going to beat his daughter's wedding tomorrow so he has to vote before he goes or go to the wedding and then quickly fly back to D.C to cast a ballot\nShould we at some point consider maybe the idea of allowing the senators to vote remotely might allow him to spend a lot more time in their district to their constituents and a lot more time away from the lobbyists and Capitol Hill\nAbsolutely laws makes perfect sense and uh there are ways to definitively verify that it is that person voting and you could do it in a ... something like Skype so that you see a a counter could actually\nSee that the person was casting as well\nYeah it was a little you know it's funny doctor I don't know if you Henry and I've been friends for a long time but uh I Know that there was a case I Know about recently I'm I'm among some friends or acquaintances where somebody had to be on a regular a breathalyzer check\nAnd I said how do they make sure that it's actually this woman who's taking the breathalyzer and they said well\nThey have a device attached to your smartphone and you have to actually look at the camera and be verified as being the person who's actually blowing into the tube showing your your blood alcohol content if they're doing multiple test you know per week\nTo assure that you've not gone back to the bottle and I thought well heck if you did that kind of thing with senators senator ... smartphone a show his retinas to the camera phone my ... my phone will do that it'll confirm who you are by right now it will confirm who you are by fingerprint\nYou could do two or three levels and say we know absolutely that's the person who press the button and cast a vote and then the senators could vote from anywhere and they wouldn't have to you know make sure they're on Capitol Hill to actually cast the votes we want them to be involved in\nAbsolutely technology can do that with a with a great fidelity these days you're absolutely right\nNow the other thing you brought up is you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs a test\nYeah in the article a I had links to a couple of videos of her speaking and she's not she doesn't seem to be affected all the time\nIt's over the past year or so where she slurs or words can find a word\nAnd that is what I Would consider way outside the bounds of normal\nUh ability to express herself so we're we're gonna have to watch that wouldn't surprise me if and when she used to posed as a majority leader as a leader of the Thames in the house that she decides to retire I don't think she's well\nAnd and it's a little side on the content yeah I don't\nI don't wish or ill but if somebody is not fully capable in politics no one wants to be removed from the spot no one is likely to want to remove themselves their own party isn't likely to want to remove them\nAnd the other party catches all kinds of hell if they say well we'll take the person out because they're too crazy\nBecause you know they've been trying to suggest that about Donald Trump and say well he's do crazy for the office\nI ... yeah okay um they're evil and often do what they don't mind working evil they do mind looking implausible\nWhere you should know that in gold results from returning every climbing a lot of room for important before she's Thomas in all let me ask you a legal question I don't do that very often but you see in the wall Street Journal report our marriage\nFor the longtime friend of of ah Christine Ford says that she was leaned on by people she told the FBI that she was leaned on to trained her story from I was in there I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I don't know anything about it you apparently to a story that said she was going to back up Christine Ford which would be\nI think if if it's possible more than one eighty or from I don't know anything to I remember the incident use is not a criminal act to you know to to go out and try to influence somebody to lie to the FBI and hence to Congress in a process like this where is that just something that's just terribly wrong but doesn't actually break any laws\nI think I I haven't looked up to the federal budget on that but it is certainly a crime to uh try to get someone to perjure themselves and\nQuite closely related to to encourage me well it was on ... I assigned a assigned oath statement yeah and absolutely the crime if it was just in talking to Senate Democrats are not saying it under oath um possibly could day\nI'm speaking to a government official the FBI agents but yeah it absolutely\nThey should and they've got to be problems here I Am so sick of Republicans and this is one of the wonderful things have gotten out of trunk he's showing it showing Republicans how funny it is to attack back for one for Republicans always want to be the gun sports okay we want in the end\nWe got we got cabin on the court\nNo no no no statement has to be made this will never happen again you will not for me or someone like this and will destroy his life like that\nI couldn't agree more who don't know what should we use said don't trot out somebody else but let's say that ah Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court in the next two years before the end of this term and\nI anticipate a second term because of everything good that's going on ... ... what can we do proactive way to shame the Democrats I Know they have no shame but what can we do to shame them to say don't try this again because private cute prosecute\nProsecute prosecute I Want to know who the letter that was given in confidence to to uh in\nThe Senate all Feinstein thing where they have to get to the bottom of that they know the name of the guy who was instantly producing the home addresses and phone numbers of Republican senators on and so the liberals couldn't couldn't bone loss bar them and that's what's known as doc thing on and and we do have\nSome perjury charges including for I Know they loved playing a judge Kavanaugh oh it's perjury\nPerjury he he didn't say he didn't say he drank excessively no I I I think he kind of didn't say that I Know he more than that\nI mean it's either falls or or selling that's what they are claiming is is perjury while\nChristine lazy afford not to be confused with Dr for number one she's not a medical doctor number two she's not even a psychologist she lied about four things she lied about her fear of flying yep um she lied about the polygraph test\nShe lied about needing a front ... to a second front door I'm I feel about being a psychologist statements under oh\nYou think that the Republicans have the guts to prosecute her for that because this I mean here's a here's my rule for that and now I'm not on the non lawyer I think if if you lie under oath I think the technical\nYou know the the ... punishment is lying under oath is perjury and in many cases they don't go after it because it's not ... it may be important but it's not consequential this was hugely consequential this could have literally changed American history for the next fad\n... a consequential result lying under oath in this case should absolutely be be prosecuted to the ...\nYeah and also we have a shot across the Democrats bell um because they are just go to a country we hundred and twenty five million people as we saw with my favorite of the false accusers a lunatic nearly sweat ...\nThey're going to be a certain number of psychologically disturbed people come forward and tried to inject a little fill that

fighter it was a horrifically um impactful against her obviously she had just turned Eighteen at the time and uh I'll I'll share one little snap\nBut I I mean I'm not as you to go beyond you know I mean I I don't want to dig too much but I mean we want to know how your daughter's doing so\nYeah but on a positive or she has served as a junior college aged with us on a on a very large and powerful joint sting operation and she's been instrumental in helping put away several pedophiles child predators and she has stood there and watch them getting and cost him put away\nSo that was very empowering for her and she said you know pop up that was more healing than any amount of counseling or anything else could have ever been so she's a fighter she's going to be okay and I think she's going to be an inspiration there to help the others you know ... just kind of how she is wired\nI think that somebody we ought to find a way I have some acquaintances and co workers who've who've been sexually assaulted\nAnd everyone reacts differently I Know women who don't ever want it mentioned again I Know women who will tell you exactly what happened you know because they believe that I think it helps give them some catharsis so\nPeople should not assume that when when someone has been the victim of a sexual assault that they that everyone reacts\nAnd saying that they they don't want to talk about it in some cases they do a and and being you know hearing the story and all that helps them out as you said it did for for your daughter many women and girls might not have had the strength to do with your daughter did to to live through that to recover from it and then to go out and help catch the bad guys\nUh that's that's an incredible shows strength and and I can't say enough good things about a young lady willing to do that\nWell you're right we do all relapse react to things differently and sometimes that the timing issue sometimes ah somebody may hibernate a bit with the with the pain and want to be quiet about it and then later in life there like you know what I'm not okay be silent or else my time to speak out so\nUh whenever whenever\nI I support anybody's method of dealing with it I mean I wouldn't want I wouldn't wish on anybody\nAnd I think that's why I'm so passionate about fighting it and just and turning our culture against it you know back in the Nineteen fifties there is a man named Alfred Kennedy that falsified a bunch of sexual studies to make it sound like a pedophilia child rape was somehow okay and he softened our laws to soften\nThe educational system to pedophilia as fast forward three generations later we've got an epidemic\nOf child rape and I don't want that to happen to anybody so I think what we've got to do now is turning the culture back against that which has proven to be so harmful\nTo children whose minds are not yet fully developed they cannot advocate for themselves against a fully grown creditor and we've got to defend the defense let's we've got to rally around our children and and defend them against uh these these harmful adult predators\nI'm Talking to ... a former special operators sniper for Navy SEAL team one and a founder of veterans for child rescue [noise]\nWhat do you hope to show in the documentary to to bring attention to some part of this from were not aware of because we know there was a child sex trafficking uh you know practice in this country and we'd like to shut it down and it seems amazing that a country like this has had such a tough time getting a handle on is\nWell it's a global problem and if for some reason it seems like it's being suppressed in the mainstream news media\nThey won't tell us what's going on with it it it is the fastest growing criminal enterprise on earth so why are we the citizens and told\nVery deliberately and very specifically what's going on so to answer your question what I what I intend to share with the American people is that which they need to know\nTo fight this epidemic that's happening to our children that they're not otherwise be told literally just to walk the American people through the truth whatever that may be to show that different aspects of what is really going on with the kids so that we as citizens can understand the nature of the threat\nAnd and effectively defend our children accordingly\nYou know Craig I I don't know whether you agree with is about like do you get your take on it\nI see an awful lot of so called homeless people on the street now some of them are there for mental problems her mother for drug problems but I get the feeling that when a young man or woman or a young child who's under Eighteen says I'm leaving my parents' house sometimes are leaving because of bad things that have happened sometimes are leaving\n'cause they don't like mom and dad's rules and when they started living on the streets\nIt seems like that is the prime opportunity for these traffickers to get a hold of them and and uh and get a hold on them and and and start to prostitute done and that that seems like something we could take care of if we stop making the assumption that if you don't want to live with mom and dad\nA ... ... you know then you can go out and live on the streets and a lot of cities like it or not aid and abet people and living on the streets and they get in the way of returning those children even to their original household bore\nTo foster family but not tolerate them simply living in probably the most vulnerable spot they can live in on the streets without adults around\nVery astute observation you're absolutely right there are predators waiting\nFor a young a lot of ways waiting for the boys at for the girls and think that that your son or daughter can go went away in the middle of the night and go to a bus stop or or or place to catch a cab or or or homeless people hang out and not have predators like they're\nReady for them to offer them a place to stay in a\nShelter um trucks and whatever else uh it'd be wrong because that is the case no doubt that that's how they could easily and they're just waiting for\n[noise] yeah I think that's right so there's ... there's there's three groups I think of people that we that we should think about one is people with a criminal record you know employers have often been worried to hire those areas you know tens of millions of of of America's with federal records as a whole bunch\nOf those I think have struggled to find work those are slowly I think being brought it back into the labor force then there are people who've been unemployed for a long period of time that still over a million people that people have been unemployed for more than half a year hopefully those folks can now find jobs\nAnd then there's the last group but I think that that the group where where the social that come into play more about the people who are having to look out at the labor force for for a for quite awhile that good about a million people you know we can bring all those people back and then I think the labor situation really is that\nIt's been in the last fifty years ah you know I think right now the late nineties still look pretty good\nYou know that had higher labor force station so not only the unemployment rate low but basically everyone was trying to find work\nWe can get back to that then I'll be fully says\nWe'll stand the limited throwing idea ... I was down in Dallas texas a couple of years ago to two new broadcast for one of our stations\nAnd I saw a company who was advertising its services construction company but I think they called themselves conned structure and they had a clever name and and on the rest of the banner they had on the side of a building it made it clear they would hire ex cons they would hire people with criminal records and why\nWell because you know while there may be some additional steps you have to take to make sure that if you hire somebody with a criminal record that your tools aren't going to disappear but once you've\nUh you know I've talked to plenty of callers to my show who said I have a ... a felony record and I tell all my employers when I first go to work for him or when I first interview I have this record and beyond\nMy behavior and I'm going to be a great employee for you and instead we have government's trying to ban you know even asking\nAbout criminal record I almost wish we could encourage people if you're going to go straight and you're going to straighten out your behavior\nThen we're we're happy to have you tell us that so as an employer you can take advantage of the skills that come with that person who may be a very good worker\nYou once you get past that but I don't want the government doing and I want a private employer and maybe somebody who says I'm going to start a construction company and I'm going to hire these people and I'm going to put 'em to work and I'm going to expect performance and I'm an expected they don't go back to criminal behavior but other than that I'll pay him a good wage 'cause then you've got access to a a whole crowd of people who may not be\nBe accessed right now by conventional employers who just screen you out of the beginning does that make sense\nThat makes total sense we we've started to see a little bit of that so for example Wal Mart which of course is that you know the the largest employer\nOf 'em all we get a million and a half ... and the U.S that they've started you know trying to target a or reject federal records a little more in their recruiting efforts and you know hopefully it'll work out\nSo where can we go from here how low can go before the wages just start rising because employers find they can't get anybody to work for them because they don't ... you know bumped the wages up\nWell I I think first of all we'll we'll see if we can absorb those additional maybe two three million people once that happened I I think you start with the wage growth as long as you know of course the economy I keep growing right so if we\nIf we suddenly enter a recession we wouldn't see it but you know given all the fiscal stimulus we've had\nFrom the from that tax cut from the\nYeah the increase in spending I think the next\nCouple of years we should we should really start to see some wage growth at least in the long run you know wages only keep increasing if we you know we develop new technology that build new factories and better equipment and things like that so\nYou know ultimately that's where we're at a wage growth is that is going to have to come from and that that it requires an innovation to continue and people want it to death and things like that\nWell we got a break in Sacramento stand on that note you mentioned the tax cuts is not just income taxes\nIt's instant expensing or rapid expensing equipment so it used to be if you bought a a new big piece of equipment to expand your capabilities uh comedy new excavator anew bulldozer or a new machine at your factory\nYou had to take the tax savings on it over ten or Fifteen or Twenty years now you can take 'em right away so there's a tremendous incentive\nFor companies go out and expand their capabilities\nStand I appreciate what'd you do at the ... guy and we always appreciate having on the program thanks for the time denied\nThat give having\nThat stand boy girl who's a resident
