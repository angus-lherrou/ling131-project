designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older\nWith all their real estate needs as you said so one of those needs may well be investing in real estate in your later years so tell me is that a smart idea or is that something you're better off starting\nIn your twenties thirties and forties\nMy opinion is is better off starting it early\nBecause that's been real estate basically asked for different areas of possible gain\nThe first is appreciation of property obviously rises in price over time as area around it does as well second profit center is that the tenant increases your equity by essentially helping you pay your mortgage down three is cash flow\nRent better bigger than outlook and depreciation so in order to put all for those two words you really want to get started early\nMhm to be a first time in ... in real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps a look at things like reach real estate investor crust that you can basically purchase through an investment advisor more like a a security than a real estate purchased itself\nYou know that makes a lot of sense because after all a real estate investment trust is more like buying stock and you're not a landlord and you don't have vacancies you don't have to qualify for a mortgage it can make a lot of sense no matter what your age is\nAbsolutely it's kind of one of those things that if you believe that real estate both appreciation generates cash flow which\nIt has historically done that's a great way not to be the only one on the hook you know being an individual owner of real estate is is kind of a you know you're the person in a ... year spread out with hundreds of other people buying\nLarger blocks with investment property and professional property management\nI see so that's good advice be or if you are already an older person it might not be the best move to start real estate investing at your age but for all those people who might be a little bit younger than that it can reap great benefits in the years ahead\nAbsolutely interesting fact the last forty years appreciation and we used to do it every January as average about three percent per year coincidentally or maybe not the wage growth in our area\nThree percent a year ... so if you believe that our economy is strong enough to keep wage growth and employment on track [noise] there's no reason that real estate pricing at least closer in shouldn't keep pace with wage increases\nPeter we still have so much more to talk about and I'd like to really drill in on your four ways real estate can generate

H.\nOne oh four one K. cue da to sons news and talk about one K. K. P. H. dot com\nWe today connecting you with real estate professionals and [noise]\nAnd we are back with our very special shown\nRetiring wealthy and entire program about how real estate can help you build wealth and generate income and your senior years\nRight now we're going to continue our conversation with an expert a person who actually teaches real estate investing to people all around the United states [noise] joining us again now is Peter ... real tour with\nBishop west real estate license to Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida he's been a real tour for Thirty years and\nHe carries many of NPR's advanced certifications including the certified commercial investment member designation Peter thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's my pleasure to be back thank you for having me\nWell Peter I appreciate you coming back when we left you in our first our we had just finished talking about a tried and true real estate investment strategy in which you buy another house but you keep the one you're in and rent it out that seems like a great way to start\nEspecially if it is a rental market for example where we are in Florida right now there's a terrific went to a lot of ... ... ... air being the murder in so long yeah top dollar\nBy renting out of the Arab be India's a weekly or monthly right do an essay and you'll rent to ... but an annual rental is slow and steady slow and steady when\nThe race [laughter] that's always going to either So Peter if someone's leaning forward and listening to this and they're fascinated by it how would you advise that they find a good property that will continue to generate a good amount of rent\nThe first thing that you need is a good realtor that knows the market and not somebody that you know from the gym or the country club that's nice to be\nA realtor that specializes in investment property and understand somebody that's willing to sit down and oh of course let's blame the pros and cons some states that if you're a residential rental property than others\nIt gets a critical piece of advice as we knew the into real estate for investment\nLeathers residential vacation rental\nOffice retail industrial you got to know what you're doing what I mean by that is you need to know the landlord tenant laws in that state\nAs how it pertains you understand that part of the business of rentals you will be on top of your game are reached Seventy five percent on your way south the successes understanding the rules\nThat is such great advice and you know we already mentioned buying a new house and keeping the one you already have but if you want to stay in your house and you're not going to move how would you recommend one of our listeners pays for property they fine\nWell you know you if you have equity in your current how it could refinance your home and take equity or you get a bridge loan between the two properties ... there are a lot of private investors out\nIt was that what they call hard money\nYeah absolutely could be called hard money\nPrivate equity investors but what a lot of folks can do you can't buy it yourself\nBut you can invest is if you have a\nIRA you can take it to be a self directed IRA\nSome banks to what some national come next to it and you invest the money you direct where it goes so for example somebody looking for money for a down payment on a deal or to finance a flip property or to get into something needs\nFifty Seventy five a hundred thousand a good source of self directed IRAs because that person's gonna get more in a real estate investment based on interest in return than they would\nIf they were to um just have it with a institutional IRA company that's paying\nProbably two percent today stock markets good maybe it's three percent\nYou know Peter that is fascinating now let me ask you another question about all this you know you have\nMore than one hundred properties if you combine Florida in Massachusetts [noise] did you just kind of end up there or was that part of your plan to have one hundred one properties by this time in your life\nThat was kind of planned out the Massachusetts is where I'm my home and I raised my son as it turned out that yes it was in the play in Venice, Florida is the right\nSpot has a lot of desire ability and therefore it gives me a face on the Gulf Coast where I can go up and down and do what I Need to do so that was definitely in the plan\nThat is wonderful one more question for you my friend tell our listeners if you will\nThat if they retire and they have anywhere from a handful\nOf properties to a whole lot of properties what will their life be like\nI wouldn't know what we're from it is and that's and that's a nervous word for bay but I can assure you that\nYou'll be able to live the lifestyle that you're looking to live without worrying about it because you're controlling your own destiny\nPeter that is just such great perspective and thank you for all the insides and the advice wonderful job my friend and I really appreciate you being on the show\nThank you it's my pleasure you're very welcome Peter West real tour with bishop west real estate license in Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida\nComing up on real estate today selling your grade\nAnd Florida [noise]\nComing up on real estate today selling your great big house I sold my family last year and in addition to locking in that equity\nI no longer on along the [noise] that's coming up on our special show retiring wealthy [noise]\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology report\nToday a big question [noise] are smart speakers on the way\nOut [noise] well they might be\nPossibly pushed aside by smart displays let's talk about that\nUp to now there have been three main players and the smart home arena Amazon Echo Google Home an apple home pod they all started his just smart speakers really smart speakers which you could ask anything and the speaker would answer by talking to you\nKnow that was the status quo until Amazon added video screens their big echo show and they're cute little echo spot were game changers because with their bright colorful screens you could watch the news watch the forecast and watch the steps in a recipe\nAnd for more than a year Amazon owned that space until last July when Lenovo launched a smart display with built in Google Assistant\nIt was followed closely by another Google display from J. B. L. but just this month Google announced their own version in their biggest development yet\nThe Google hub the replacement for its original Google Home the hub has a seven inch video screen and premium speakers built in\nAnd when it comes everything Google is known for from Youtube videos to step by step map directions to your personal calendar but now you can see all those things not just hear about them\nNow the Google hub is a smaller device which would fit justice comfortably on a night stand is in the kitchen and perhaps because it would make such a good smart alarm clock nestled right next to your bed the Google hub does not come with a camera\nNow the pet store shelves this Monday October twenty second and its entering the market at a lower price point one hundred fifty dollars compared to two hundred and thirty dollars for the second generation Amazon show\n... how about apple\nWell so far it's excellent smart speaker the home pod well that's all they have there's no talk of an apple smart display not even a rumor so what if you already have a smart speaker without a display\nGone to the point where it's you know ... well over a quarter million dollars worth of equity that they had in the house because things would appreciate it when it's a principal residents of subject to certain rules\nThey can sell that house and put that quarter of a million dollars in their pocket free of tax\nAnd if they're married it's five hundred\nExactly [noise] so what I'm saying ... some people doing as well is\nTaking that exclusion by another property and start that exclusion all over again\nStart the clock up again in ... slash five hundred\nAnd that's particularly useful for people who are thinking gallon size so why can't sell the big home walk anywhere from fifty five hundred thousand start the clock over again in the tunnels intend to Fifteen Years cell that walking your capital gains free forever by a condo\nThat is such a great strategy Peter\nSo for example I'm In my early sixties and I sold my single family last year and in addition to locking in that equity I no longer own a lawnmower\n[laughter] I can go fishing whatever I Want [laughter]\n[noise] oh my gosh you know it just comes to mind that real estate can help you in so many ways in her later years you don't have to limit yourself to being an investor you can be just smart with your primary residence\nCorrect exactly Peter awesome advice great job and I really appreciate you sharing your knowledge with all our listeners today thank you thank you very much I enjoyed it quite a bit\nYou're very welcome Peter Crouch real tour and associate broker with macaroni associates incorporated in Alexandria, Virginia [noise]\nA real chore who give back\nThis is rewarding helping veterans and see in the community rise up to assist veterans\nTwo veteran fish is rewarding helping veterans and see in the community rise up to assist veterans is like west very rewarding that's next right here on real estate today [noise]\nYou want a beautiful wood floor and your kitchen about or material but you also know eventually there will be water or mugged there which ruined everything right or\nWrong would would look like Bruce vinyl plane flooring only available at the Home Depot and you get the would look you want a plug in completely one hundred percent waterproof guarantee so now where there's water there can be ...\nLife ... final Frank Lawrence starting to to Seventy nine ... only ... at the Home Depot or say\nUs when we start bringing down\nAn official message for Medicare open enrollment ends soon so now's the time to be open minded look at everything like prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans I'm having insurers why\nBecause climb straight so can you how I found lower cost and extra benefits and saved money open to something better\nBut it's better just got a call one eight hundred Medicare today open enrollment ends December seventh\n[noise] paid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services\n[noise]\nHere's the cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America is affected by a hard water contains harsh mineral that can dry out skin and hair hard water can raise our electricity bill by up to\nForty eight percent it even create filled out the pipes that can lead to pathogenic bacteria growing stressed out yet he'll be felt based ... can solve all your hard water as you\nGet the full scoop at a little salt dot org [noise]\nBy the time that we got up there he's ... now they went and had blown and drifted than you know up again by my house blocking lanes on from my furnishings okay I heard the smoke alarm going off\nIn my friend's apartment without the ... and then when I mean here you had it not man for an acting and army went on line and they would come to Nicole and not have their teacher and I grabbed my ...

where\n\nWell\n[noise] our question that goes from ... dot com pond out for yourself why blinds are\nIs the number one online retailer of custom window covering you get free samples free shipping\nMan with a new promos that they run every month you'll save even more universal promo code Ramsey to get the best deals rules and restrictions apply\nToday's question comes from Kristen in Florida they took out a lease on a vehicle about four months ago before enrolling in financial ... feel like I made one of the worst\nFlorida Dave took out a lease on a vehicle about four months ago before enrolling in financial base university I feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return lease car\nTo the dealership or at this point I just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nMe take your car back that you own money on our signed a lease on that's effectively\nA voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb\nBecause they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it\nAnd the other and on repossession lot\nAnd then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the difference goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're the least is a very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nSo the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that well that's what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that\nTo KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sales what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up and the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole ... probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will sell it for on the report lot so his bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession\nAnd so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we've been talking a lot about this
