P. told Fox Business\nBetween the insurance industry and the reinsurance industry together those two industries have\nHundreds of billions of dollars of capital in surplus so the good news is and hopefully it will be some solace to the homeowner impacted by this storm is that the financial stability of the insurance and their insurance industry's is not an issue\nMeanwhile Florida governor Rick Scott has ordered the state's top insurance regulator to freeze property insurance rate increases for Ninety Days and to rescind for Ninety Days all policy non renewables are cancellations\nAmerica's home builders remain optimistic the latest National Association of home builders Wells Fargo housing market index mine's the builder confidence in the market for new single family homes rose one point in October ... confidence level has held steady since June one thing that's encouraging builders be moderating price a lumber\nComing up and a half an hour help paid off is your city Steven back to you\nAnd we have the latest information on contract signings for you today [noise] the national association of realtors reports that in September\nPending home sales rose compared to August no not a big jump only a half of a percent but still an increase however year over year pending home sales fell one percent\nAnd ... in the face of Paula Jones now that's just scratching the surface on Bill Clinton's the party of all of the sexual miscreants can they pretend now that they represent the interests of women when they what they mean is bimbos\nSay that the Democrats the bimbos must be believed we believe that the ... it's a little change from last time around because the last time around they were ... they were slaughtered they were ruined they were wrecked they still can't show their faces in public because the Democrats did such a job on\nPlants ... four one K. key th two sons news and talk [laughter]\nDave Ramsey show\nThat this is an unusual RadioShack listed a lot of\nA big talk radio fan big fan of some most of the guys that are major national figures I Know some sort of friends um\nThis is just a different place here people being real\nSo people actually are nice to each other [noise]\nSame Randy shower let a new one on one in four one K. GPA Susana Susan talk oh [noise]\nMe today connecting you\nBack again now with our special show scary thing about those parts of real estate that my view the shivers like borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars more putting down roots\nAnd when my first question to Elizabeth was are you scared\nAlways always Colleen is it is always a scary\nMost ... in front of in the air too\nSo what happens in Columbia, Missouri on Halloween Night\nTrick or treating you know trick or treating happens it's also the last day of October so like many communities the last day of the month is very popular day for closings with um homeownership and and so if people get ready to wrap up those mortgage payments and they move into a new home\nAwesome [noise] some people across America have thought about buying a home but it's a little bit scary to them should it be\nBefore I bought a home I got home ownership was scary to me any repair or anything that might have to happen to how it was always two thousand dollars no matter what I was if it was a roof for it so it was a leaky faucet I thought it was going to cost two thousand dollars\nBut that's not the truth and certainly you know sometimes homeownership is scary because you realize not only are you going to now be responsible for your monthly payment to live you're going to be responsible for the most ongoing payments and you know realtors that's a great place where you can use your local realtor who can connect you with\nThose experts in the neighborhood the plumbers electricians it takes away a little bit of that fear 'cause sometimes not everybody has those connections and they need to a realtor cannot make\nThose when you make a really good point because you're not only paying the mortgage also paying for maintenance but it's your house and you can maintain it so you can make sure it's done right\nAbsolutely and and maintain it the way you want to I think that's another one of the great benefits is now it's your home and you can do what you want to with it and you can add on a deck if you want or you can put that picture in a while or you can decorate the outside for all those trick or treaters\nAnother scary thing is borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy that house for some people that just terrified I'm\nSure that's one of the very first thing that's going to happen when you meet with a realtor you're going to have a conversation about\nThe mortgage process and you know and in a row trees are going to recommend some lenders in the area who you can talk to about what that payment means how you pay it back what happens is you know you feel you can't afford it or you or you can't payment and how\nTo manage that process but it's their long term payments and it's you're investing in you\nKnow you're not investing and someone else and with interest rates being lower rent being higher it's a very good thing to chicken too because it's very likely that you might be able to pay less in a home and investing yourself in someone else\nAnother thing we're here to visit some mostly young people are afraid to get tied down they don't want to put down roots they want to stay free and that's why they don't buy a house how about that\nPart of one of the values of this country is freedom and being able to move and do what you want to do but in order to do that it does require resources and many times those are financial resources the best way to build wealth\nTo have the freedom to do what you want to do is to own that home it's an investment in yourself and your future and so\nUm it's a great way to really establish your financial portfolio for life\nAs a matter of fact as one young person told me the other day they're going to buy a house but they still want to live in different places all across America so at one point dove rented out and they'll move somewhere else solid\nI mean certainly want to check with your local realtor find out about the communities there are communities that rent better than others and so but it ...\nWith your local realtor find out about the communities there are communities that rent better than others and so but it becomes an investment portfolio for you and we are seeing that you know as people want to continue to move and home owners today\nAlso become traveler and are renters in property for a vacation days so you get to have the benefit of both\nThere is a tough one ten years ago the financial markets crashed some people are afraid to buy a house because they're afraid that's going to happen again\nSure that's where your local realtor really is important to have a conversation 'cause every market is different and every market has recovered differently from that financial crash certainly there's been different changes in lending that are going to help mitigate that for the future so there had been some rules and regulations that have been put in place to try to avoid that\nWhich will help our home buyers and that but you want to talk to your local real chore about the conditions of the area where you're considering the by whether it's a first home or a second home you know our prices increasing it the inventory low or high you know that will give you more of a sense of a long term investment picture\nSo finally if someone gets passed all those scary things and they buy their own house we need to remind them that one of the most comforting things ever to sleeping in the home you know\nIt's what everybody wants to do at the end of the day\nWhen you're tired when you're excited you want to go home but it's also the place you get to celebrate so many memories get to celebrate birthdays and dinners and you certainly get to celebrate hopefully all those trick or treaters you come to your door and and the costumes and the sun and the interaction with the neighborhoods and that's a great fun thing about this week\nWell happy Halloween Elizabeth ... men and all

T. bank millennials outspent every other generation on Halloween to the one\nWe will spend an average of about a hundred and eighty dollars on candy costumes decorations and other random duty

scary\nHomeowner I wanted to talk about the best and safest ways to prepare your home for Halloween 'cause there's no reason Halloween can't be scary and safe\nZones grudging let's hear\nFirst for

little as three percent down conventional loans through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\nThat is awesome Rob and so the thing that you bring to the table but is so valuable to homebuyers all across the country is that wherever you live in America chances are\nThere's a down payment assistance program right in your area and people don't know about and that's what downpayment resource does it tells people look here and you might find money for your down payment\nIf they're eligible for one program we say that most of those attached wires are eligible for somewhere between six to eight programs

infamous which trials took place in that year some three hundred twenty six years ago two hundred people were accused of practicing witchcraft and\nTwenty of them were executed\nBut the years since I've been very kind to stay on because now it's a great town and a booming real estate market it's location just north of Boston and right on the water is a top destination for homebuyers but do those

which believe it or not is a real religion that people don't realize\nYou're kidding no no and we have a lot of a story than and things that cater to that population here so it is a big draw\nIs that right so a typical homebuyer comes to your office and says I'd like to see what's available in our price range in Salem, Massachusetts how does that conversation go does the which thing actually come up during your talk with them\nYou know what comes up a little bit to be honest with you but most of our history is based on merit time and um you know our Eighteenth century architecture\nI see so tell us a little bit about that what what I find if I was looking for a home in Salem and if I was looking for some of the local attractions\nWell homes and Sam I'm can range anywhere from things that we're both at sixteen hundred wild\nTo you know converted loft in downtown to more residential neighborhoods with split level homes\nI see and you mentioned its maritime passed I imagine you have a Lindy interesting seaport area\nOh it's absolutely stunning and in fact I don't know if you realize Salem was supposed to be the capital of Massachusetts\nIs that right it is but um fortunately our harbor wasn't deep enough\nInteresting so as we mentioned Pam Halloween is this coming Wednesday when you see a lot of visitors to Salem because of his past involving the witch trials\nFor sure [laughter] they're our tour buses throughout the month of October but Halloween day we can easily double our population if not more\nIs that right just for the one day\nSo if I come there and I'm

and following the girls and\nThat is fascinating yeah [laughter] so Pam do you like working in a town with a Halloween themed to it\nFor the most part yes because you have to realize people come from all over the world to visit here just for that\nNow I understand your husband owns a retail shop in downtown Salem called the barking cat that all about [laughter]\nHe does sell cat and Don products\nOh I see so it's a pet supply store it is\nSo it has nothing to do with Halloween or which is or black\nCats know although that is mandatory and sailing by the way is it really yeah you have

thanks for joining us today thank you so much happy Halloween you to pay them Mickey real tour with the Keller Williams panicky team in Salem, Massachusetts [noise]\nComing up on real estate today just applying for a mortgage make you want to hide under the bed\nKnowing yourself going into the transaction can shine some white or those dark little corners of mortgage lending scary things might live and come out to make an uncomfortable\nThat's coming up on our special show scary thing [noise]\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology report\nSingle one of his does every single\nDay right there in our very own homes charging our smartphone it's an important topic because after all so much of our lives and our real estate happens on our bones these days so you need to keep that phone all charged up\nBut you know how phones keep getting better and better well part of those improvements involve charging improvements that can help make that daily chore easier and faster than ever\nThere are two types of new charging check you need to know about one is high speed charging the other is wireless charging we'll talk about both of them starting with high speed\nThe company Qualcomm came out with what it calls quick charge a few years ago and many of the more recent phones have it basically a charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour now that's really fast\nAnd then the speed slows down to protect the battery and the rest of the charge takes about sixty minutes\nNow not all phones have it but you can find a list of the ones that do that the Qualcomm quick charge website just search quick charge\nOkay so quick charge is great but you still have to plug it in right well right but that's another area where the tech has gotten better\nThe old us be many conductors word the industry standard but you had to plug them in right side up or they wouldn't go in\nToday's a USB stick and actors can be plugged in right side up or upside down and they worked just fine same goes for the very latest thunder both connection called ... three\nOkay so that's high speed charging now wireless charging wireless chargers don't plug into your phone at all rather there cradle or desks or square blocks and when you get home just put your phone on it\nDone no plugs no cables just put the phone down and let the charging begin\n[noise] it's not as fast as quick charge but it's so easy\nWell knowing yourself going into the transaction can shine some light do those dark little corners of mortgage lending to a war scary things might live and come out to make it uncomfortable you know if you know who you are as a borrower know where your finances are no what you want to know what you can borrow\nYou can go on with confidence and that won't scare

while for one occasion the H. two sons news and talk about in reverse [noise]\nThis is real estate today in your home Nineteen your biggest investment\nI Know with our special show scary thing our annual tribute to Halloween which is this coming Wednesday [noise] and of course one of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with the down payment now in our first hour\nWe talked about new research from the Urban Institute about barriers to homeownership and how coming up with that down payment is so frightening to some people\nThey don't even try to buy a house but those fears are largely on founded because sure some people are not ready to buy but many who are they think they need more money than they really do\nAnd amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably ...\nTwo and amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably has a down payment assistance programs ready willing and able to help homebuyers get into that house\nLet's talk about that now joining us once again is Rob crane with the organization down payment resource Rob launched downpayment resource to connect eligible homebuyers an eligible properties where it's hard to find a down payment programs Rob thanks for coming back on real estate\nToday it's great to be with you again okay so Rob\nLet's talk about those down payment assistance programs\nFirst of all it's not just for first time buyers every time correct\nCorrect and I say that for two reasons one is that\nPart of that is because the definition that's normally used for first time homebuyer is that you haven't owned a home in the last three years so you could have gone on in the past and\nNot own a home for three years and for these purposes you still need the first time homebuyer requirement also there are in our database probably about thirty six percent of the programs do at any first time homebuyer requirement\nInteresting and another thing Rob about downpayment assistance programs you don't have to necessarily heavy starter wage to qualify I understand that people can actually be making a really good amount of money and still get the assistance\nThat's absolutely correct a lot of it has to do with where you live because the uh ... household income limits on these programs they not only the area for the program the program\nBut they vary from state to state city to city region to region so if you live in high cost areas the area and median income is going to be higher than low cost areas so depending on where you live you might be able to make over a hundred thousand dollars in your household\nAnd still qualify for a lot of these programs\nThat is amazing so Rob how to our listeners learn more about down payment resource and the down payment help that might be available to them\nWell they can go the down payment resource dot com and ... button that says find programs and to her about six or eight pieces of information about their\nHousehold\nAnd then the festival tell how many programs that are eligible for an a to hell and about those programs\nAnd where to find a money most importantly right that if I doubt you're eligible for money you better at a pass to get there and and it's just some well tell him that they'll tell them not only where the where where to find the money we were the participating lenders participating education spiders and so forth\nI see so Rob let me back up just for one minute if I learned that I Am eligible for down payment assistance they don't just write me ... all that happens during the mortgage application process\nExactly exactly so it's really important when you're looking for a home to find a lender as a lender before you go out looking for a while actually that's that's the first step because you don't want to get excited about home than trying to figure out if you go forward forward it or not really\nA but when you're talking to different lenders thing that you want to be sure and do is ask them what downpayment assistance programs they participate in because that I did lead to participate and even the lenders that do\nDon't necessarily participate in every program most large metro areas have dozens of programs\nDon't necessarily participate in every program most large that dozens of programs so really find out first when you talk to the lenders can do it with the programs\nThat is great advice and Rob I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about\nThe latest report barriers to homeownership by the Urban Institute and also the ways that down payment resource can help people find the money they need to put down in a house thank you for being here\nI guess David it's always great to be with you I appreciate the opportunity\nYou're very welcome Rob crane with down payment resource connecting eligible home buyers and eligible properties with hard to find a down payment programs [noise]\nUp on real estate today

how are you trying to than the fan on thinking crowd around your show\nCertainly thank you how can I help\n[noise] okay [noise] so I and follow your plan for like a couple of months now I had the emergency find that I'm working on baby step too good on that night and I had made progress not a ton of it's on our best\nAnd I ask you this idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I Am not letting it take over my life good and my question is how do I I check 'em for my deductible\nAhmed ... recently I recently switched off ... started again I'm also the chronic illness you're going to hit the adoptable every year\nRight um\nIt's ... the guy that thing on the go it's not they don't have and it's not life threatening are you going to double every year\nYeah okay so now also they look at what what is the nature\nIt was very ... because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced God help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right right and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number\nOkay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three\nThousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing frantic medical when just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something now yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so so thanks for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't\nLike the way I can make that happen so what I've been hearing have [noise] I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you can do right now on what I'm I'm hoping over time on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we going to get an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where\nOur identity ended that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand on that I make\nI don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switch to a job I had more flexibility on some in a fee for service division as opposed to a salaried position mhm and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck and\nI knew he had a device on Monday on line you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with that\nGuy gets them I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy I rent it give us a lot on and I do that from ... from ...\nTo them and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nBig fat is everything credit card I also because they can hear it I was trying lot of holistic thing mhm on medical and then a student loan or most of it if I can get it out there that I have like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things in the food pantry not

grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as an end of the dead as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in a pair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\nHere's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming [laughter] you're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah\nI mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... actually I've got ... how do I prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term we gotta get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your

yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nAnd all the way we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of ... of all I Want to get your input on it we\nHave our ten percent fight it but we want to live without thinking about putting data and given back to the church and didn't have an extra five percent and kind of giving it to\nUm other charitable organizations that we believe in that are about doing day or a ... you know when the crisis mission is that we're trying to looking at trying to give what we can to people who need it\nUm but if she's on the other hand want straight ten percent a church and then you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to get it from the church and\nWe had a big argument about high then yesterday I was\nI was as long as you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time is when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament\nIs tent it literally means chant the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker a plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave\nI'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you I Love ya [noise]\nUm you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a time of the tens of your income evangelicals have taught him\nTestament and Jesus reaffirmed within the New Testament is a tie a tenth of your income evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years that that private is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer your wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical not your wife was argumentative she was correct biblical re [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nNow where we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand and cars twenty two thousand and other debt\nLike credit cards and all that so one Osama includes cars yes 'cause the cars\nFifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's the ah about eight thousand on mine and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year where did you use to mount the old drum\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why now I'm In\nReal estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate ... I've got to choose a house is sold ... things and ... by the end of uh the second week of November\nSo what is your projected income for the uh the that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year and that was what does your why didn't make of the ...\nFifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out\nI'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and everything is she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [noise]\nOkay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just give them hell that cancer thing there by yourself and those groups that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and in ... in health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her is that we needed my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these qualities of course we'll have\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to is I'll get a car cash and then she sells her car and then what have at least one quarter right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're gonna move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay offs and other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are pending or clothing by then\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by the second week of November everything should be close to St\nLouis just two and three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today\nI Would sell your trial today and I\nBut I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's your room mates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of debt making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you are not wanting to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then\nShe's not willing to\nJoin armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage problem\n[noise] okay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit you run around and started selling mama's car is not weigh a good way get mom on board\nHalo so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go [noise]\nBut if it that and then you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looking at us on our car too and you get hurricane car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this mess cleaned up\nThis is the day Ramsey chef [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of\nIt they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share ... team they\nHave offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution\nThey've accepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply have more options\nFor exit than anyone else it could be a long process but there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit team is so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for for\nNine nine nine exit and schedule a free\nConsultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com\nChris plants show morning moving on to a blissful future where a target market decides who's guilty of news innocent and we've had all these Democrats\n... brand and Mazie Hirono and\nYou know there is no presumption of innocence there is no due process they don't actually believe in the constitution of the law they don't believe in the last I also don't believe in human decency and basic human decency and then when I say they don't believe in basic human decency I made that I mean that they really don't believe in basic notions of human beings and see the ...\nDon't believe in basic human decency I mean that I mean that they really don't believe in basic notions of human beings and see the ... most of us were raised by her mother is and sometimes by our fathers or the idea that you'd be fair and a decent honest truthful that what matters is the truth or\nNot we use ... drew political snakes\nUh and uh I guess those days are those days are gone those days are behind\nThe increase blanche LA collected on one boy one K. key P.
