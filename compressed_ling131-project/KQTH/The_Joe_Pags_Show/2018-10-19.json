I'm Talking to dirt mauled who's a former special agent in charge of the da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da to try to interdict some of these drug operations inside their borders because that seemed like the logical place to stop and we can try to stop it from being smuggled in but as you pointed out a tiny quantity goes a long way\nOr the Chinese doing much of anything to try to go after these drug a drug criminals that are making it\nLet's put it this way in China are a lot of these chemicals are not even illegal to export and these cameras that they hire their their very clever because they know\nWhat the controlled substances are so they know the molecular formulas and they change a little bit of the formula so it's not even like technically illegal and so the U.S government\nThe department of justice the DEA has had several meetings recently what China to try to get them to understand that this may not be illegal but it's destroying wise all over America so there has been some increased cooperation but lost honestly it's really not it's nothing to brag about I mean the ... the politics\nThe politicians will make like everything's moving down to write at but it's a bunch of BS to be honest with you from my standpoint I mean they're not aggressive enough with them it is China it's a very complex situation I don't claim to be a Chinese experts but we do know and your listeners know\nThat China is a really really big national security threat to our country and this is just another piece of it you know they're they're hacking opt computers they're stealing our identities\nThey're going after a financial grades and I lecture grades\nSo you know dumping poison in our country is just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had\nIn our country is just a side thing but one note I Want to tell you you know when we went after these Afghan heroin traffic is for a long time we actually had a few of them say selling heroin to the west is like a jihad against the west\nAre making millions of dollars and we're killing Americans so this is the same concept in my opinion on that this is partially you know what's going on depending on\nYou know who in China was actually standing at all well\nBecause I think about what they accomplish if they can manufacture the drugs cheaply and the Chinese government turned a blind eye to it and allows it to happen they not only damaged the United states they have is incur tremendous human costs as well as financial cause and all that cash from producing those stuff\nFlows back into China in one way or the other which is good for trying to because ... and the soup financially so they they get tired and I get to hurt their biggest competitor the military as well as economic competitor and they get some of our cash at the same time it's a win win and\nI I call it a two for one special laws I mean they win every which way and and by the way the Mexican cartels are just\nIn it for the money and they're making billions of dollars that you know and they're right on our border and there's so many illegal here in America right now involved with the cartels different aspects of the cartels distribution a you know whether it's the money collections that drug distribution stash houses you know\nBuilding compartments these guys are all over our country a and honestly we got to shut down at the border I Want to really make a difference\nBut stuck it in the military involved and my my ... my opinion my opinion it sounds a little bit traumatic but if you look up on the website department of state has criteria for how you'd designate a foreign terrorist organization and in my opinion based on good all common sense\nLook at what the Mexican cartels are doing and they meet the criteria to be designated a foreign terrorist organization if that happens then we'll have different authorities to use our military and others to kind of feel that order and knocked is nonsense off with just put the politics you know if you look at nine eleven\nIraq War the Afghanistan war you added up every one that died and then even the Vietnam War\nIt still is that how many people died last year from trucks so what is the American public in a ... wake up stop listening to these phony politicians that are in it for

H.\nTwo I'm honestly for a bucket of going a little Lars Larson show will come back\nFrom Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you this Thursday that I'd gone to get your calls at eight six six eight Lars\nEight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson\nCenter Dana how is it the one some of us understand you have to be interesting on Twitter or or people are going to be bored by your comments\nBut there's a line you don't cross or you could get yourself a band you know for saying things that are really out of line and yet Louis ... seems to be able to get away with just about anything you want to on Twitter and he never get suspended how is that\nAh that's called bias so [laughter] I mean let's let's be honest here but\nThen the one of the big problems that the social media search media companies have is they don't treat everybody the same if Louis Farrakhan were some sort of right wing anti Semite or you know central wing or new anti Semite he'd be gone a long time ago he's\nA left wing cook has got big connections he has long been connections with everybody for Obama on down he you know the the left in this country has kissed his\nLunatic rang for many years and he gets away with it so he lost a little while back\nHe lost his check mark yeah the one that gives you a little sense of oh you're you're famous person but he's got about a million followers and and while Facebook got the the post taken down he's still on Facebook he's I garbage person that is said to compare Jewish people\nTo insects\nAnd it's it's the kind of stuff that we used to see in Nineteen thirties Germany propaganda\nThat's the kind of thing he gets away with and the and the folks at Twitter let him do it\nAnd he ought to be on a watch list at Twitter I mean for the kinds of things that he says I mean in in a way that I Hope not to be I think I tried to keep most of my comments pretty sensible interesting but sensible but this guy is just amazing what he gets away with\nIt really points to is apocryphal is these organizations look you know I I come from a the era of more speeches better speech and so\nYou know if they're going to leave Louis Farrakhan up there why the heck is Alex Jones doubt or they're going to do it I mean\nThere if you're going to allow people that somebody thinks it's frigid and and it's kind of case I I didn't see anybody defending it probably there are a nation of Islam people out there because he's got a lot of followers and there were a lot of people were cheering him and that you know bigoted anti Semitic audience but the reality is\nHe was attacked by the left he was attacked by the center is backed by the rights and the way it really is going after him for a long time a prominent journalist for criticizing him\nAnd he's still there because you know in the world of the left\nIf you are a representative of victim group oh well then you can't do bigoted stuff that's always been the argument that's got to be what they are claiming here even though he'd do rapidly violates their terms against hate speech directly\nHey I Want to ask you about something um have you seen this piece of video\nOf an antifa man I'm just bashing and in a costing a woman who is the widow of one of the police officers who died in the nine eleven terrorist attacks in New York City and this guy\nThis is running on Fox and I've run a today earlier and I may play ... I can play some it if you like but these are two people they're not confronting each other the woman is just standing at a street corner\nA I guess are both perhaps headed in the direction of a protest the antifa guy for his side of the protests during the widow of a police officer in the direction of the you know a a a different protests to counter\nOr just in the widow of a police officer in the direction of the you know a a a different protests to counter protest\nBut this man begins to things that young man and the woman is not wouldn't say older but she's she's older than he is um and he just begins bashing they're cursing or a wishing that her husband a you know writes in his grave after she informs him that she's the widow of a police officer who died in the terrorist attack\nAnd I don't see it running on a lot of other of the sort of mainstream media other than Fox on cable um well should they be have you\nSee I haven't yet I've seen is yes and it\nI lost two of my classmates and nine eleven which is nothing in comparison to losing a family member but I I you know for people who live in Washington I live in New York this was a ... attack not just a national attack\nWe all knew people and you know this is very personal and watch it and it gets so angry at the get go walk wish the computer I that's that's my reaction\nBut this is how the American news media fix everything they get we always end up talking it up by a spy commission said the oh this comeback said this is Scott said that\nYou know this reporter's lied this they did this day but the worst bias in news media is biased by omission they hide the things that are uncomfortable to their narrative if they went out there you go to Chris Chris Matthews both out there saying oh the Republicans are hyping this month ... it's all garbage it's all a lie and when in fact\nNo it's the absolute truth it is a problem and you've got you know monsters like this city and I may I salute monster to do this he must have seen had I think\nI think you did because she was wearing an NYPD had and he started berating her oh your husband do do do this and she said I'm not married he said well then you're you're NYPD cop boyfriend and he brings up the ... assault that happened involving New York cops two decades ago\n... ... you know I mean I remember 'cause I'm an old guy but I don't even know I didn't even know somebody his age would even remember it but but he's breathing this woman in the most viable terms and you'd think\nThis is somebody who's not under assault he's not in the face to face grilled to grill a kind of confrontation let me play just so the audience knows what I'm Talking about I believed out all the bombs you'll hear the beep soon\nThey're kind of\n\nI'm not like you're not going to see\nThe way you're going out for him [noise]\nGood hand might be much of a mind\nThing immigrants and their bully [noise]\nBut yeah you're right and the great\nRock in the grave and she's standing there waiting for a traffic light to change so she can walk across an intersection legally and he just starts into her\nAunt and his screaming and yelling at her in a way that I'm very sure Dan far surpasses the standard you have to hit\nTo be called you know the crime of intimidation somebody walks up to you on the street and start talking you and that kind of threatening manner they're committing a crime is it's no longer free speech you would think this would be getting a lot of play in the major media CNN MSNBC and with them having to but then they'd have to explain\nThat a lot of these antifa creeps this is their regular M O o\nMSNBC and with them having but then they'd have to explain that a lot of these and keep it creeps this is their regular MO all they do is attack people even people who are doing nothing provocative\nThe things that they say I mean I I Know that\n... years of watching lifted protests under my belt this thing's called they call for ... of police officers on you know they'll do a live broadcast the name of police often offer ... police officers the vows things they say the police officers and Joe\nOh yeah you just things I Can't even I won't repeat\nThey just said this to this woman\nYou know this is where the last ... doesn't end well there there's so much pent up anger on their side and that they want to confront he wanted her she wanted to cause a scene that's what they tried to do they actually train them to do this they train them so that\nIn state governments all around the country that also includes two suicides\nElection I'm In state governments all around the country that also includes two suicides and all\nOn accusations of sexual misconduct\nNow there hasn't been a whole lot of investigation about this so uh you know people sometimes as I said don't collect the connect the dots but they have been weaponized this for a long time they've gone after Democrats and Republicans but they seem to go after Democrats\nWho are telling the the party line surprisingly you know the ones who vote against sweeping gun bills like the one in Colorado a so some things very sinister has been going on pretty much for the last year\nBut you would think that after a year of sort of cleaning house whether you're swept up some good people along the bad people and you had some folks accusations that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets wouldn't think\nNow they never run out of targets because when they do they just manufacture evidence or there's a case this case I mentioned to you and Colorado you know there were two very suspicious cases won in Colorado one in Arizona\nSteve led socked in Colorado Don shooter in Arizona they didn't bank on these people fighting back what they wanted to do was forced them out\nScare the heck out of them and asked them to resign\nThey were targeted and and I'll tell you in the Colorado case they had a um a day in which Democrats and Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after a hundred and three years\nNever had been an expulsion in the Colorado State house of representatives that day a Democrat got up and said because my wife was molested when she was Seventeen\nI didn't vote yes on the expulsion of ... now and now this is these are law makers who are\nPutting forth arguments that would be thrown out of court in a nanosecond so I that's what I became suspicious and I started doing a little research on this and I was I was truly appalled at what I found they had flown out due process\nA long time ago\nWell in fact the larva got thrown out in all the title nine nonsense the letter guidance that went to the colleges where they said if you can't get a legitimate sort of charges against say student athletes who are thought to have committed some sexual assault then put it into effectively a kangaroo court uh and and in those cases\nIt's interesting that some of those targets were I mean I think most people too young to to to categorize politically one way or another almost be a political college student athlete who may be officially a Democrat or a virtually Republican but\nYou know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through the ringer\nAnd with no evidence no nothing they would they would end up being kicked out of school the worst thing you could do to them at that point in their life because they haven't built a career like like a judge Kavanaugh had are now justice Kavanaugh had so I I just want to hear the odd\nFor that and thank God for that but you wonder how much are they going to go and the almost instantaneous reaction well if he's accused you must be guilty and let's move on to the next one that's a dangerous standard to adopt in a due process country like America\n... without a doubt and among my many concerns about this is the notion that you can uh\nWell without a doubt and among my many concerns about this is the notion that you can\nUh build some kind of um\n[noise] let me go well let me go back to what you said at the beginning or these are people who've been trashing the culture all along and and in a heartbeat\nThey had made an about face and are now acting like Puritans\nSo number one we cannot buy in to this idea\nThe left is brilliant and building a culture that's what I wanted to say they build a culture around these these false notions\nAnd that's how you get I was listening on line to your last interview and it was it was stunning and riveting to hear I saw that video and and you've got\nLawmakers who are actually leading the charge in lawless nuts\nYeah and that is they're developing a sort of a hard core double standard where when an anti per person does something that is a criminal assault in most communities merely by walked up to somebody on the street corner today\nAnd just started shouting at them and screaming at them and I did it for any length of time if there was a police officer within you know within earshot he'd come over and say you're going to knock that off now you're going to jail because that's the crime of intimidation so we're excusing it for certain people\nBecause they opposed Trump and then we're saying but for everyone else there is a hard and fast you know kind of standard and we will we\nCompletely destroy you if you cross a turn thank you so much and congratulations on your Facebook shows spouting off that's Karen Adeline and you're listening to Lars Larson show
