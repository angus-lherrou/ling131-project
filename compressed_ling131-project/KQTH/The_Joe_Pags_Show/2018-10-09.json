Judy [noise] welcome back\nTo Lars Larson shows line to be with you and going to take your phone calls and emails we always like visiting with\nRegime Gabriel who's a terrorism expert in chair aback for America the largest national security grassroots organization in the country and the New York times best selling author of a new book called rise\nHis national security grassroots organization in the country and the New York times best selling author of a new book called rise regime it's good to have you back on the program thanks for taking off on\nTheir own delighted to be back with you\nI Want to know what you think of of what happened last week an over the last couple of weeks but ending with the vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh as the latest member of the Supreme Court on Saturday\nWell America as we know it is being transformed before our very eyes and what we saw in the last two weeks I was basically a wakeup call for conservatives will love this country because the left has declared war on the United states on every flag waving national\nAnthem saluting veteran respecting police honoring founding father cherishing patriotic American the conservative side did not realize that we are at war until the last two weeks and I believe last that this upcoming election America's future is on the ballot\nPeople are going to vote for in America where you are guilty until proven innocent or in America where you are innocent until proven guilty\nBruce reducing the Republicans have the guts to make that argument because you want to make the argument easily that this really is about whether or not the presumption is there and if not what does it mean\nBut I think I get the feeling that while the left seemingly will do almost anything to win\nThat there are a lot of conservatives who are afraid to say something now we've had plug some surprises from people like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham who was a riot are but the rest of the Republicans have the right to have the you know the the backbone\nTo say this is what we're up against and do you want that kind of America were the kind we offer\nWell this question has\nA two layer to answer on the political side the elected officials I think after watching Lindsey Graham become a rock star overnight I think what what team did last week\nMade him to start at the ... to ... define him through his political career and I think that I really I think you know what if you develop a backbone if you speak passionately it will resonate with the people because what Lindsey Graham\nDead is he echoed the voice of president Donald Trump for the last two years and the way he spoke the courage to display the moral clarity you spoke the authority you spoke with and that touched\nA nerve and the American public so I Hope that the other elected officials who are running this election thinking well if I Want my spot on the lights mind day in the sunshine I Need to start speaking boldly la Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham on the grass roots side\nYou know a lot of conservatives are not emotional people there are logical people so we are not that people are going to show up on the side of the road\nDemonstrate I break glass breaking buildings that create a riot block highways it's not in our nature this is not what we do but it was up to this point thought well if I just go out and vote you know that that will be it I'm going to make my voice known but what what we saw in the last two weeks so conservative that activism\nGoes far beyond just voting every two years there are a lot of things you can do between the two years and I hope that that it showed conservatives how much the left is organized and they need to be involved in grassroots movements that are fighting on behalf of our country\nI'll give you a perfect example with my organization at for America we saw a spike because of the cabinet where people came because they wanted to know what they can do as a citizen and that's what I lay out in my book why I wrote my book wise and defensive\nWanted to know what they can do as a citizen and that's what I lay out in my book rise I wrote my book rise in defense of American values and freedom because I wanted to give people ideas and tips as to what\nThey can do to make a difference for example at the end of every chapter I have a section titled rise up and act where I felt people three things you can do under ten minutes and you can do them while sipping your cup of coffee in the morning when you get the job was sitting in front of your computer\nThat's a great way to do it now will there also be some suggestions and therefore elected officials because Bridgette\nI Would love to see citizens turn up at public meetings and I would apply this to Republicans as well as Democrats and Republicans especially\nThere are so many Republicans who won't say something even though it seems very apparent that they want to lead you to believe they are in favor of something but they don't want to say it out loud they don't want to say the words where you just said saying if you believe in the presumption of innocence you have to support what we just did and if you don't\nThen you ought to be prepared to explain to your fellow citizens while you're willing to throw somebody under the bus and what are you going to say when they come and do it to your friends or your family members\nI Need I Need a citizens to go to to elected officials and demand that they speak the truth plainly\nExactly and I and and you said it was because the way they did it together now they're\nComing to you know they're coming up to your son is coming after your family and and this was on display in Washington DC the last two weeks it's not going to end with Kevin now I Know it's interesting you mentioned a town hall meetings and the last chapter\nOf my book cries I had a whole chapter is dedicated to how citizens people like you and me who need to get that voice out how\nTo fill up the town hall meetings and how to ask questions to your elected officials I even lay out a plan how to make friends\nHow to sit across the audience how to have a pre within questions how to stand up and ask these questions how to set up your elected official to understand that you represent the majority in your community you know that love wrote books on how\nTo mobilize the grassroots or whether it was organizing for action by president\nObama weather now indivisible resist look I signed up to get all these leftist organizations um email by the way right now we lost as you and I are speaking there are eighty five leftist grassroots movements operating in the country and mobilizing on the right side people are asleep\nSo what I Hope to do and that book rise\nAnd I encourage a single person who is listening to end this interview right now to go out and get the book because it's a road map not only to how you can call your elected officials on hold their feet to the fire\nBut also how the law that lives in your community to show up the city council meetings to show up to I I liked that official town hall meetings to elected official on the spot\nAnd record their answers how to use your cell phones as a tool to spread messages on your social media we on the right to understand that and the tools that make us\nPowerful grassroots citizens participating in the future of our country and the decisions that are made on behalf that will affect us and our children for generations to come\nAnd Bridgette I um I get frustrated when people I agree with politically will show up at a meeting they'll get the opportunity ask a question and then they either want to stand up and give a speech before they asked the question not ... and good sometimes the symbol\nThe question and then they either want to stand up and give a speech before they asked the question not ... and good sometimes the symbolism question you can ask\nWill you support new gun controls will you do something about building a wall and and then just to amplify by saying and I want a simple answer that we all understand a yes or no not something that allows you to skate out either side\nMake the question less than two sentences long preferably one is less than one sentence law long because otherwise politicians are used to the non answer for the question they don't want to answer\nExactly perfect I Love the way you say that because that's exactly what they need to do you need to ask your question and stop speaking to let him go dead silent and for the elected official and giving you that the what they spend on a show I because\nIt cost you like that that is a great point and very clear they cannot beat around the Bush what they're they're they've got the right question and make sure that your friends who are you at that town hall meeting that you do I do need to that meeting are standing there with their cell phones running\nCycle of this um\nYou know it it it you know and the Spanish went to a certain parts of North America and the French went to a certain parts of the recognition and the English\nAnd the Dutch went to a certain parts of North America and then we had\nYou know various and sundry wars and some people stopped coming in some people moved and some people laugh and then pretty much we had you know there's this geographic area for 'em up that became known as the Thirteen colonies and then the Thirteen original states the United states of America\nAnd then we had more people from England and then we had lots of Germans and then we had lots of Irish and then we have lots of eastern Europeans and then we have lots of southern Europeans and we had\nLots of Jews come over mixed in with that and you had Muslims come other mixed in with that and when everybody got here yes they did did did everybody goes through some level of unpleasantness\nYeah prop of all of them but I suppose so also\nEverybody had the opportunity to pursue and excel and and and the CI\nGreatness and you know now we have immigrants coming from the ... across the other ocean and they're coming from they're coming from from Asia\nThey're coming from southwest Asia\nUm they've helped build the Internet they help us build the home computer they invented the u._s. be they've revolutionized the way that we communicate and engage in commerce and living standards are going up and up and up and up and I say hallelujah amen\nThank you very much thank you very much that that you or somebody who is in your blood lineage had the courage to pack up if they came voluntarily pack up whatever they could carry\nGet on a boat\nCome across the ocean to a place where they they move very few people to try and build something better because that active courage on their part made my life so much better thank you very much\nPeter offices of Newsweek contributing editor so why don't we see more politicians willing to stand up and say we do not have to dishonor Christopher Columbus in your race him from history and a race in from the public square literally a New York city and Columbus Circle to be able to honor other people who came here\nWhy aren't there aren't very many proponents at all of continuing to honor those men\nBecause I think that a lot of the discussion about immigration has evolved\nAround the problems that occur when people come here\nWithout going through channels um without 'em\nAnd and make if they come here underground they become a sub culture and they she used to assimilate and that's one one of the important things about the American immigration experience is that up until about the Nineteen seventies we held out the idea that the simulation\nWas was was uh was was the goal was\nMelting pot yep um and that it

I don't don't react\nYet we've got a new administration coming in that you would have seen that whether there was cooperation between the Trump team and the Russians for the election you might have seen that just because well for the same reason that a President Obama said on an on a hot Mike\nA ... cell ... I'll have more flexibility after the election well he did have more flexibility Disney\nIt's interesting but if it were just sort of run of the mill ordinary signaling between a pending administration and a foreign government you know why would why did Flynn and go to such lengths\nTo lie about it he lied to the president they lied to Sean Spicer lied to the FBI have you figure that one out of\nBoard that's one of the puzzles of this if it's all above board why is there such effort across the Trump Administration to service suppressed these facts tonight effects it's similarly to Trump's initial explanation of the Trump Tower meeting obviously has undergone so many revisions if there's nothing to hide why are they doing so much hiding\nI think that's a legitimate question but I I I I've been ... politically confused on this and obviously Greg as the author of The Apprentice and as a man who covers national security you're much more ... than in this than I Am I still don't understand why one Flint agreed to talk to the FBI and then when it became clear that they were asking\nAbout conversations he had that you would think would be intercepted I mean as\nAs an essay wouldn't he have known that everything he said on the phone line to the Russian ambassadors people or to the Russian ambassador himself was going to be on a transcript somewhere and the the FBI was trying to say we want to see if you will tell us what we already know and what we already have\nSo it makes me wonder whether the FBI had deliberately set out to say we know every word he says let's see if we can get them to tell a different version then we've got 'em in a process crime\n[noise] hey there's a lot of detail in the book that has not surfaced publicly because I've ... I was involved in breaking the they fling story for the Washington Post and gone over that sweet sequence of events and detail with dozens of additional interviews for the book\nIt's not only that Mike Flynn should have known and having been director of the defense intelligence agency what\nA sort of surveillance exists of\nA foreign adversaries here in the United states but in fact there were people inside the Trump transition who are so alarmed about the Trump inner circle sort of teams interactions with Russia signals about Russia that they tried to stage an intervention would plan after a meeting in which he talked about\nNeeding to have a conversation with the Russian ambassador there were people who are trying to get to see\nStage an intervention with Flynn after a meeting in which he talked about needing to have a conversation with the Russian ambassador there were people who are trying to get the CIA profile of the Russian ambassador surrogate Kislyak in Mike Flynn's hands and telling him you got to be careful what you're doing here and he ignored all of it\nListen graves level of determination terms of their actions here that is just astonishing\nI'm Talking to Greg Miller who's the author most recently The Apprentice plenty ask you a question that has ... me and I I Do see it through a partisan lens but I I'm willing to say that of Republicans have broken the law you've ever pulled Republicans have done things that are not good for America than than they should be you know they should be appropriately punished for it\nBut here's the Russia collusion that I don't understand why it has become more of the public discussion and I have to think it's because of the mainstream media\nWe know that there are Russian officials who told Christopher Steele a whole big pack of stories most of which turns out seemed to be untrue unpredictable and almost ridiculous or in the Steele dossier\nHe he is he puts together a document with information from Russian government officials\nFor Hillary Clinton and the DNC there'll be has and paid for by them which is then used\nIn what could only be a an attempt to change the outcome of the election one other purpose would there be of trying to push this documented so many news people and it's so many officials if not to change the outcome of the election when that didn't happen they used it to try to take apart the Trump presidency once the election was over\nWhy isn't that seen as a collusion between the other side with Russian government officials true paid intermediaries to create a different outcome for the ...\nWell I think if you look at the steel was hired to do and how he was hired and how he was not told who the client was and how initially fusion GPS has hired in fact by Republican or a new\nShow operatives to look at Trump's into sort of look into his background and then they turn and get funding from the Democrats only after after Trump is one of the primary and they think that they're on to such fascinating material they think somebody ought to be willing to pay for it and of course they do find\nThat the DNC is willing to pay for it um but still you know is a by all accounts a pretty straight up a former British Intelligence official a nobody accuses him I don't think of things sort of a political hit man here\nAnd it's we don't know a whole lot yet about the sources of his material for the ... but I guess I Would argue that you know although some of it is unproven it certainly seems\nPlausible that Trump would be interacting it would be conducting themselves in in a Moscow is the way he conducted himself in Lake Tahoe with Stormy Daniels I'm not sure why that would be so astonishing if that were to be true\nIf it were true do you think you know ... is largely true are largely not\nI don't really have a firm opinion on it I think that the abroad as strokes it's it's actually held up pretty well\nIt takes you were people to vote in a congressional representative because\nOf the large number of people who are just qualified from voting so that's something that hasn't really occurred to a lot of people as well and some of the lawsuits that are beginning to either be formulated or in the case of Alabama they are now suing because Alabama expects to lose the the\nAfter the two thousand and twenty cents and so it ...\nStates and and congressional areas are beginning to understand what kind of power and leverage\nThis gifts to those areas that become magnets for immigrants who are here unlawfully and those numbers as they're padded um give them an easier way to relative to other districts\nTo be able to pass some of these policies or elected congressional members\nDeserve practically mean but the representation of some people in this country is being diluted by the president to these illegals so\nThat's the entire debate our system is based on one person one vote and to the commentary as being written in the lawsuits are are now being created it's a matter of challenging that's the question of\nReally is it one person one vote when some districts have an easier way\nOf passing things or electing wherever\nReally is it one person one vote when some districts have an easier way of passing things or electing representative because there are so many just qualified voters in their districts\nLet me ask you straight ahead a constitutional questions ensure constitutional attorney\nUm are people who are here in the country illegally are being titled to representation in Congress would say we're in the state legislature uh even though they're here in the country illegally as is has there been a definitive answer to them\nYou know\nUh and people will say yes there has what they're doing is looking at a loss\nThat that went to the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court let's just the issue of district day\nSo that's a matter of how the lines are drawn and they said that these people count as far as the drawing of the lines but the question has never been answered when it comes to apportion that\nAnd that means how we figure out or the four hundred and thirty five congressional districts and that's a fixed number\nSo it's very much a zero sum game and so when it comes to those districts and how many people count in those districts and whether they are\nCitizens and eligible to vote that question has never been answered and it does all go back to kind of an arcane issue because the fact that\nWhen our country was founded it was a matter of the state's looking at people who are eligible to vote in just different states we all have different policies back then as to what was what a ... created eligibility and and the wording habits and which carries with it a legal status was used\nTo qualify that people who were here and eligible to vote\nSo now it's a matter of looking back at that language an original and has and and understanding that person and have it and\nWhen it came to the way that our founding fathers originally looked at this um inhabitant meant somebody who was here lawfully and who was qualified to vote\nDoes it help move as we go there we now have another originalist thank God on the U.S Supreme Court you're fussing come to record\nIt very well may help when it comes to exactly this kind of an issue which is what\n... with we are interpreting our constitution and the way that it was meant to be interpreted in the spirit of the time and what the founders intended and that yes it then we are looking for people that would be faithful to that original into\nWell I'm looking forward to that who would have standing to bring peace in this I've only got about twenty seconds but how could somebody go ahead\nAlabama fears losing a seat and so there is a harm that's demonstrable so states like Alabama where they're looking at\nThe shift that has been happening and certainly as California picks up for other states do those seats come from somewhere else so it's the states that began to look at what their accounts are in some already have on those states would have the standing to either join Alabama I Would think or\nCreate their own cause of action their own lawsuit\nWill go to a pleasure to charge all look forward to the next on thanks very much anytime\nThere goes the front or the liberty ... project and a constitutional attorney speaking of politics\nWhen you vote for governor if you're from blatant evidence of corruption tortured stick\nThe traditional attorney speaking of politics would you vote for

you know that for a lot of us we look at China\nAnd we see China as a country that wants to be a militarily preeminent on planet earth and they want to be economically preeminent uh I think that they would they would like to replace the United states\nAs the biggest single economic player on the globe and the biggest some single military player on the globe and I I don't think they're taking any prisoners when they started creating artificial islands and they start to up to push a bit\nAgainst us and say don't come near us or that sort of thing so I thought we'd talk about that was Stephen ... who's the author of bully of Asia why China's dream is the new threat to the world order\nSteven it sounds like you and I are both on the same side on you hear on this issue but how big is the threat that our country faces from a China\nWell the threat from China in twenty eight and is like the threat from the Soviet Union in Nineteen sixty or night\nWe have a president now is turning up the heat on China and China is facing the same kind of a systemic collapse if we can keep the pressure on if we can keep the Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi is from a grabbing the levers of power and from the Trump I think we'll win this thing\nI like to remind people Steve but then you back me up or or correct me if I'm wrong that while we have a large national debt the national debt in terms of gross domestic product that China has\nMakes ours look small by comparison and China at some point he was going to have to come to grips with the fact that they do an awful lot of money that they have a a a huge amount of debt and and they're very dependent on the rest of the world because that's where the goods made in China are sold for the most part not to their own domestic population\nYeah you couldn't be more correct because the only sector of the Chinese economy that actually runs a profit is the export sector\nAnd the export sector runs a profit because they have\nLargely until recently\n... have had unfettered access to the largest consumer market in the world which is the United states the rest of the socialist planned economy of China is is a nightmare of wasted money wasted resources um bridges to nowhere roads that no one uses and and so forth buildings that stand\nEmpty so if we can cut off their easy access to the American consumer market\nOr their economy made a limp along for a while but you're right they've got debt or we don't know exactly how much debt they have actually it's it's at least three hundred percent three times the annual\nGross domestic product so they spent every any that they made for the next three years they might be able to pay off the debt they might not so they've got a huge huge debt to carry around and and that's one of their weaknesses\nWhereas in the United states by comparison we have a a a gross domestic product or of around ... trillion dollars and the national debt around ... trillion ours is a hundred percent of GDP your gp theirs is three times the size proportionately\nYeah and our economy is now I think growing faster than China is now you wouldn't you wouldn't think that from looking at the official figures but look the official figures in China are nonsense every year\nOr see gene thing the new red emperor comes out with a plan saying\nWe're going to get six point one percent economic growth this year and every province in every city in China record six point one percent except a few very ambitious party officials\nReport six point two or six point three or six forty four percent but the real growth is probably down at two or three percent or growing out over four percent so the gap between the U.S and China is not narrowing is actually widening because we've turned on the great engine of American Capitalism and his running now at full speed\nI'm Talking to Stephen ... who's the author of bully of Asia wide trying his dream is the threat new threat to the world order\nAt some point though when the numbers they give out publicly and and it kind of reminds me is I think it did you of the old Soviet Union where they would announce that we're going to harvest fifty million bushels of wheat or whatever the number was\nAnd they would only harvest forty and for domestic consumption they just go back and change the numbers and say well we were planning to harvest thirty eight and we came in and forty you can run those kinds of games on your domestic population as long as you control information that comes into them but it's still possible to do that\nAnd have people actually believe what the government is telling them in an Internet age\nWell you know the the Chinese have built all over the centuries but they now have built a great firewall in an effort to keep information and news from the outside world from\nAnd I think it's it's it's partly successful things get posted on the Internet are critical of the government they get taken down literally large within seconds within seconds or and so you know they they've got banks and banks of a computer terminals\nAnd and many I'm sitting in front of them making sure that\nThat know criticism of the party of the military of the government and above all of of the new red emperor seizing thing gets posted on the Internet now we try to do an end run around that back in the early nineties I was on the presidential commission that set up Radio Free Asia which is our radio broadcast service\nThat broadcast news and information about what's really happening in China\nBack into China to do an end run around the straight controlled media and I think that's been fairly fairly successful over the years\nAh yeah the information information lease and they don't have a an absolute monopoly on news the way they did and the Soviet Union back in the thirties went oh my goodness style and killed\nFour million people in Ukraine and ended up having a a a a manipulated a deliberate famine to kill off the rich cousins and no one on the outside world knew about the walls are drawn to the New York times saying that everyone is well fed and the Soviet Union there's no starvation millions of people were starving to death at that time\nSo how how long can they maintain this this pretends that they have all the success when all of the people generating the fake numbers are are in on the secret and it's no longer a secret in other words if you're saying everybody should report six percent growth\nAnd ... you must have multiple people in each of those provinces saying make the numbers look the way the president wants them to walk but everybody involved in creating those fake numbers knows they're fake\nYeah well they do it and and are they the the the pre merit\nNot the current one but the previous one admitted this a Premier Wen Jiabao ten years ago he said I really don't pay any attention to the numbers because they're all fabricated he said I really look at the uh the number of containers\nAre being shipped from Shanghai to the United states I really look at uh the electrical power that we're using I really look at the rail traffic he said that gives me a sense of how the economy's really doing the numbers he said don't matter so I thought that was a rare moment of ender on the part of Chinese officials\nAre I'd just even in the last minute what's the best way for the United states to react to this to counter it if necessary and to take on the ...\nWell to do exactly what President Trump is doing he's a he's a dealmaker he's going from\nFrom issue to issue getting the best deal he can and and getting as many concessions as he can and then moving out of the next or the Chinese the Trump the strategic they're terrified of him is pressuring China economically but also militarily an ideologically as well and and I think his goal and it should be\nTo to prevent China for replacing the United states is the dominant power in the world or the world under the U.S as a safer or more democratic place than it would be under China I think everybody would agree with that\nSteven it's always a pleasure thanks so much and congratulations on the success of bully of Asia why China's dream as the new threat to the world order we appreciate your time denied\nSecularists\nYou about Steven measure was now coming up in a moment we're about a month away from the election a little less than a month and in some states there's vote by mail but in the majority of states there is not what they call early\nBut some of the things they are discovering are quite an using which one is that millennials are are dropping off dramatically they don't\nParticipate so much in early voting because they're too many steps you have to Austin apply to get an application to get the ballot you have to fill it out you have to sometimes you know things like their Social Security number or have you put down your\nYour proper dress and then you have to find a stamp and an envelope at a mailbox and these are steps that you know millennials just really can't do\nNo do you believe that I'm Wondering what the result has been with millennials who studies like especially Oregon I mean I happen to my broadcast studios there but one of the disturbing things I've seen is that they have automatic registration too often I I hear from parents who say my sixteen year old daughter is registered to vote\nAnd I said yeah she can't go till she's Eighteen but they do it automatically when you get a driver's license\nWhen you make that easy where\nThe minute you get government id or whether it's a driver's license or an ID card you're registered you get a ballot then once you turn Eighteen he comes in the mail whether you ask for it or not\nAnd all you have to do is pick it up open it up more could put it back on the envelope and send it back when they make better use she do millennials still drop off or do they vote in greater numbers\nI that I I'm not sure they have the data yet on things like that we really are in the beginning stages of a new experiment and\nUh but I I Will speak of ours I don't know if you realize this but I was a county chair at one point and I am very well versed on how you register voters and how you uh get people on the ballot and things like that but uh uh I think when you drop\nA ... a ...\nIt started in a in a location where you are permanent resident you get voter fraud yeah I mean you're going to have valid nailed the people who don't live there who at one point lived there so there is no way to verify who that person is so it was right\nThey break where you have voter id you go in on election day and they see your driver's license and they see you or a an a match it up on a some kind of voter roll and that\nDoes a a provide us security level to ensure that the people who say they say are voting are actually voting and uh I I Do think as Lee I after this election and we're still trying to figure out some of the cyber security issues\nTo secure our voting system I Do think we are going to go again back at this issue of\nUs who is voting and a ... secure\nI saw the just today the LA Times broke a story saying that the DMV in the department of motor vehicles in California has admitted there were twenty three thousand registration mistakes including a Canadian citizen who got notified he's lived in California but he was notified he was newly registered to vote\nHe does have a California driver's license\nBut he's not a citizen the United states citizen to Canada according to the LA Times and he said I Know I'm not going to vote I'm not allowed to vote but that won't necessarily apply to everyone if you've been living in California for Thirty years in Europe for national and somebody's send you a notice aged says you can vote\nI imagine some people will simply take the opportunity even though we're doing it is committed a crime\nThey've apparently had tens of thousands of these kinds of mistakes just in the state of California where they do have automatic registration and where they are giving drivers' licenses to both legal and illegal aliens\nAnd eight so I could give you another example in twenty Thirteen land and there are like Bloomberg was a completely his third term he\nHad two hundred people in that department investigations go out in the twenty Thirteen Years race and vote as dead people and sixty one out of the two hundred could vote as a dead person\nWhy you know when you stop\nThem and uh and so if that is what happens is a New York is not a voter id state so people can walk in and they are because Harry they're sticking your church with why does on a what does the list and so without voter id dead people he knows that he he uh you know people will argue\nWhether there is a you know voter fraud and he uh he he has a way to prove that you know that\nThere that people could vote\nUnbelievable Adele it is a pleasure to have you on the program I really appreciate you taking the time stay on the story of a feeling that this election is going to produce some interesting result and it may not be all that comforting to those of us who consider voting a rite of citizens and when we find out that people who are non citizens are able to vote thank you\nSo much for having a\nYou but a dome out parents whose the national political reporter at
