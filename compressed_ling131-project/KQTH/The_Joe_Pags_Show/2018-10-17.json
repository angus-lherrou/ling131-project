moral Lars Larson on one oh four one K. cue the eggs [noise]\nMorning rowing winger coming on the show\nWelcome back on the program I get back to your phone calls and emails shortly\nAt eight six six eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com and we have of course the last couple of days been talking about the brutal murder of Saudi born legal permanent resident of this country ... ...\nAnd I wanted to talk to a Frank gap thing about that he's the founder and president of the center for security policy\nDid you know ... a Frank at all\nI did not lost on no nothing bit but I'm not a person like limited let them do\nWhat do you think we're being told that he was in that embassy in Turkey for uh some interrogation ie apparently walked in to try to get a birth certificate of some kind that was going to allow him are no divorce or typical that would allow him to get married to his fiance and he goes in his fiance standing outside\nHe simply does not come back out at the time the embassy a closed up and he was apparently a interrogated and they say an interrogation gone wrong what little we been able to find out about what happened is it pretty clear here that the Saudi Government or people who acted on behalf of the Saudi Government murdered this man\n[noise] it seems as though that's the case of course in the in the consulate that would've been people who were supposed to be there um\nPresumably representatives of the Saudi Government there were some Fifteen of men are better than the special forces background who or flown in I think\nEarlier that day or the day before and left immediately after this incident so there there's a lot of circumstantial evidence that suggests that the government of Saudi Arabia was involved I I kinda think of this from what we know so far Lars this kind of a\nA mafia war\nBecause no one had you had the\nSaudi Government a predominantly\nNow guided by the crown prince Mohammed bin ... and the U.S a man who is clearly a consolidating power and trying to take his country and about different ways uh uh in a new direction yup\nAnd on the other hand you had a guy who was very\nClosely associated with and seems to have worked for the former head of Saudi intelligence turkey I'll flies all\nOf a man with the Muslim Brotherhood background a who has worked in the media relations a space for a turkey ... and the intelligence services for Saudi Arabia under the previous government or the one that\nDoesn't sell them on his father a decentralized replaced and what we know about that or is it was evidently\nThe fed by the way up there is law you're insulting the keepers of the holy places uh the the family of Saudi Arabia royal family but\nHe was also threatening it seems uh the the uh the government of a now predominantly M. B. S. as they call it so it it was a it was a\n... ... what it was designed to such or whether it just went bad wait until now at the moment but I think it was kind of like a you know one ... or ... took out the other and a and did it in a ruthless Sasha\nMy because Frank I think the American people and I I think you know there's been a night or being sold a bill of goods we're being told well does innocent journalist who's just writing things that are critical of the government which journalist in this country do all the time whether it's Obama\nOr Trump they they write critical things about the government I say critical things about the government but this guy was a player in the Muslim Brotherhood\nHe was a friend of Osama bin Laden\nAnd you said that he shared that organizations goal of trying to supplant the current government which is you say the current government of Saudi Arabia is trying to take\nThat country in a western direction\nAnd uh and and this guy was trying to stop that so\nYou know wild that while that may not justify his murder um\nI I could certainly see that the American public's being told was just a journalist who was murdered and that's wrong they're not being told he was a political player who may have been trying to is it fair to say overthrow the current Saudi Government and take it back and in Islam is direction\n[noise] well it certainly reason to believe that that's the aspirations of the Muslim Brotherhood you know they they didn't to\nOverthrow of the government of a President Mubarak in Egypt the they were able to achieve that through a democratic process but they certainly were I'm\nTaking Egypt in ... premises direction now the government of Saudi Arabia Sharif premises too but it's it's a it's a\nGroup under the Brotherhood that would be very hostile to us as was the Morsi regime in a post Mubarak Egypt and I think what the president and the government is is trying to wrestle with is first of all we don't know as much as we'd like and second of all we don't want to\nBring or otherwise contribute to the removal of the relatively friendly not altogether but relatively friendly government under bother to solve on\nWas one that would be dead set against us and our vital interest in a strategic place like Saudi Arabia the Iranians would like that um other enemies of this country would applaud but I think that's not in our interest in the president's walking a fine line I think\nYeah and it's a tough one let's talk about something else the statutory commission to assess the threat to the United states from electromagnetic pulse big name we've talked about EMP before on this program it could come from an an attack\nFrom any number of sources it could come from a natural solar flare but it would literally knock out some or all of every single computer chip in America which runs everything\nRefrigeration water power sewer you know the whole thing and in many many people would die if that happened in even up an area of this country\nThe Congress has finally hearing some specific things that can be done to safeguard against this threat\nWell they've been hearing it for years a large the first of these commissions are reported in two thousand four and a has done so several times since I'm a whole bunch of reports were finished about to hear it\nThose things and so we may not actually get the kind of\nA clarity about the danger that will say single let alone the\nCorrective action that's needed um at least if this uh this new commission that's coming on stream a presumably shortly is a is involved and and this is heartbreaking because I think the president wants to do something about this I Believe John Bolton as bus or a national\nSecurity advisor is very ... committed to trying to\nShake sisters that executive order that sort of a kicking around inside the uh the executive branch at the moment to\nProtect our grid it's absolutely vital and you say a lot of the 'cause my died by some estimates according to the previous commission that might be Ninety percent of us yeah\nEven hit ... yeah I mean if we had a ... kind of attacks and you know North Korea that maybe a smaller a threat at this point but if anybody a terrorist group hit the west coast within EMP and knocked\nOut all water all power all sewer all all all supply\nAll ability to move goods around or anything like that we could we could end up with a lot of communication that all of that even if the rest of the country we're capable of throwing in to help we see how even small disasters\nOr will will tax the ability of the country to to deal with it you know a hurricane that hits a relatively small area and it still takes a tremendous amount of resources to make that happen\nBut now they're protection is available to people just like you and me and I have it I got it from my family to my listeners get Fifteen Percent off\nAt my id care dot com slash Lars learn more and let my id care take care of you the way they do for me my id care dot com slash Lars ... that's my id care dot com slash Lars and then enter promo code Lars and save some money on the deal\nGlad to have you with me I mentioned that story about friends\nYou know my wife has some French background in her family and that is actually real\nBut now we see this story about France refusing to honor and honest to God hero because it might offend the moslems\nAt one point this is from gateway Monday at one point a local policemen sacrificed himself so that a hostage could live the French hero is named are no bell train he was stabbed to death by an Islamist jihadi\nBut they will not honor the hero with the street named after him because the French government has said it might upset local Muslims\nYou might remember twenty four the march this year and ISIS terrorists stormed a supermarket\nArmed with a handgun a hunting knife and three homemade bombs\nHe shot two people dead took others hostage during negotiations with police the terrorist excepted police officer bill trims offer to swap places with the last hostage\nWho was a female cashier ... also said his phone on a table with the line already open very clever so the police outside can monitor what was going on inside after a three hour standoff with the police\nThe terrorist rod do on like deem a twenty five year old ... stabbed and murdered the police officer or no bell train but we're being told that you can't honor him\nYou can't name a street after him because that will upset the Muslims\nIf you were a follower of Islam I have no problem with you practicing your religion if you're a follower of a follower of Islam who it'd be troubled by honoring a police officer who sacrificed his own life to save that of a hostage\nThen you're not my kind of Muslim that'll let's go to Jonathan and Kentucky hey Jonathan welcome to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind\nWell thank you for having me but I Want to talk about if a deficit that the Republicans ran up with this tax plan that people are talking about the gates I Want to know man I Would if the fiscal responsibility of the several hundred billion dollar\nDeficit of our federal government and McConnell said Republicans told his tax plan will go to work for everybody and now the government it and the crap or I mean where's the fiscal responsibility ended it now\nThat the government by the way has been in the financial crap or as you pointed for a good long time you know that by the time Obama left there was twenty almost ... almost twenty was wasn't quite twenty trillion dollars in debt that we had taken on he doubled it from ten to twenty during eight years\nNow we have well ... well I'm going to answer your question\nI Do do I think we can grow our economy enough to diminish the size of the debt and get the deficit down really to death and comes down to something you and I do every day do you spend more money than you make right now Jonathan\n[noise] uh you know because I don't have the\nA lot of money goes to rich rich people in defense contractors\n... head on any area before you get to the bumper sticker lines how much you pay in taxes every or do you have any idea I'll bet you don't\nCurrently I currently pay to the federal government sixteen point Ninety four percent\nGod's slide state government that small\nPart because I'm In a small tax bracket right but I don't make enough money as it is\nI understand I only make money over the years I Want you to keep more of your own money so you got a tax break out of it I got a tax break out of the tax changes do you think we've seen the result in the economy that is now growing it more than doubled the raid due out early\nYou have to take Obama for that because Obama that\nObama does not do that I\nChop chop off as a child is just kick it back on what a successful black man it for eight\nYears on a ton of nuts and blow who I have a bomb ...\nHad nothing to do with the skin color let me explain it to you in the thirty seconds I've got before the break that's not what happened Obama hadn't economy grew at one point six percent for eight years and in the last year he was an office it dropped down to one percent\nAll the people who say well Trump just inherited this great economy it doesn't match what the numbers the economy was going down the hill when Obama was going out the

now but I'm not a difficult for us and I actually I\nI I can tell that just by talking to you and I have to tell you of all the Web sites that I see and I do a lot of research and I I Try not to confine myself to just a narrow range\nYours is perhaps the most optimistic but not optimistic you know based on just ... to look at the world but optimism based on real numbers and I'm I I follow your Twitter feed and I think it's absolutely amazing what you've been able to do so\nGive my audience a taste of what happens when you actually look at the real numbers not just about the United states but about the rest of the world and how things are are getting and had been getting a lot better for a long time and they're on an upward trend\nWell thanks for the opportunity to do to your uh took to audience ah basically\nUm ... it's much easier to put together a list of things where the world is getting was than a list of things where the world is getting better because the world is improving along many different dimensions ah most importantly obviously people live much longer than they used to um get a life expectancy\nFor hundreds of thousands of years Bailey was about twenty five to seven years ah now\nIt's ah I'm Seventy nine years in a in other countries it's Seventy\nTwo years in developing world um we have more food than ever before ah for most of human history people worried about getting enough calories to see the next day [noise] um today people worry about obesity\nUm literacy ah it it's almost a universal um girls go to school was previously a they weren't allowed to\nUm there's even more peace around the world very few people appreciate that are really for the first time in recorded history there are no international conflict by which I mean conflict between two silver and nations so that there are a lot of ways in which I'm In which the world is getting better unfortunately\nUh the media but also the human brain and we can talk about the structure of the human brain late to a focus is on the negative rather than the positive and so instead of long term trends people are looking at um\nYou know individual instances of where a something bad happens and they assume that that somehow represent states abroad trends but ...\nMean Mario on I I have to plead guilty that I've worked in the news business for a long time and I I hated it they'd be would say why is that you always tell bad news and I said well\nUh we have I happen to live in a city with a few hundred thousand homes and I said we always do the story about the one home that caught fire last night instead of the two hundred and Ninety nine thousand homes that didn't catch fire and that can lead you to a little bit of a pessimistic attitude but\nI'll tell you the number that impressed me the most because we realize that well money isn't everything\nThe ability to be out of the extreme poverty which has been you know it's been the norm as you say for an awful lot of the world for a long time\nBut you took numbers from the world bank and pointed out the people who live in extreme poverty in Nineteen Ninety that was thirty six percent of the world more than a third of the world lived in extreme poverty and lived on less than two dollars US dollars per day and that's adjusted for local prices\nThat number between Nineteen Ninety and today twenty five years dropped from a third of the world\nTo about one tenth of the world now we'd like to get it to zero zero but you said even though world population increase by two billion people the number of those\nScratching a living out of the dirt was was reduced by one point two billion and I just wish more of those numbers were put in income to put it in context the other developments where we do have to say there's a famine here or a drought there\n[noise] yeah I'm as max Rosa from ... pointed out\nUm we could have a ... or the number ... ... the newspaper's could run the following headline every day one hundred and Seventy seven thousand people have escaped from a salute poverty today and they could ever on aid for the last twenty five\nYears and he would be true um but to your point about the news cycle that the problem is that good things tend to happen on a different time scales from bad things bad things tend to happen immediately and that's\nThe way they use is what is good things are incremental they improved slowly over long periods of time and uh consequently\nUm they don't like the the headlines are the headlines usually are if it bleeds it leads\nNonetheless we live in a world with the least amount of absolute ... ever and for the first time of the Brookings Institution show last week or two weeks ago a loss that half of the world is middle class who would've thought\nHalf of the world out of what are we ready to seven billion or eight billion already\nWelder seven and a half billion people in the world and what the Brookings Institution there it is to divide the world into four groups are the first group is people who live in absolute publicity\nThat's below two dollars per person per day adjusted for our um local prices are then the second group was between two dollars and eleven dollars\nThen the third group which is\nWhere the middle class begins was uh from eleven to a hundred and ten dollars and finally the school walls over a hundred and ten\nDollars per person per day and a roughly three point six billion people a fall into that category between eleven dollars and I'm I'm a hundred and ... and the over a hundred and ten dollars so um yeah for the first time in in in world history half of the world is a middle class\nI'm Talking to Mario ... who's the editor of human progress dot org I highly recommend the side and their Twitter feed and I've got no other dog in the fight I just look I I was talking to a reporter today and she said uh your wife tells me that you're an optimist I said I Am an optimist I think most problems can be solved and things are getting better\nI'm I'm a big fan of ... who wrote this you know this guy or gal environmentalist but you don't just focus on the numbers and on on dollars and cents you also focus on just the general improvement of the human condition can you give my audience a an example or two of how things are getting better you mentioned education\nMhm [noise] well I'm a first of all let me just say quickly that I don't think that you and I are me to be optimistic this is not about convincing people to be\nOptimists certainly on blind up to us it's about people\nBeing ... about having a realistic view of the world and the realistic view of the world is while on the way things are improving\nNow when it comes to education a that's a that's a perfect example you know I'm a as late as uh the beginning of the of the of the twentieth century it was very rare for people to receive more than a\nTwo or three years of education even in the most are developed countries I'm now a education the primary education suddenly so at least seven or eight years of primary education is completely stand at the end\nOf one of the reasons for why that happened last technology ... ...\nI Do like doing little bark and one of the greatest inventions also caused the tractor a and a a mechanization of agriculture because for the first time in history I'm a farm owners didn't have to rely on that children\nAre in order to the farm work um but we're able to keep the children at work while uh the the the head of the family of the farmer\nUsed a tractor and in order to produce a to to to to produce his harvest and um and that was very important because as late as Nineteen hundred forty percent of Americans who are unemployed in another culture\nIn twelve Thirteen Years we're supposed to practically doubled fuel efficiency and what that does is as you said earlier\nThey have to a vastly increased costs in order to implement technology things like hybrid vehicles which are vastly more expensive than traditional vehicles or they have to wait wait and they're doing both\nAnd the problem is is that um there's very little benefit for this this at thousands of dollars up to six thousand seven thousand dollars per price of an average vehicle by most estimates and the this is right now because there's not an energy shortage a gas can be\nIt's not because it's because the demand not because of supply the oil of a crisis of the seventies is over America's an energy giant now we have more reserved than ever so the rationales entirely gone to only rationale is to fulfill pretty much of a green agenda of leftist politicians and bureaucrats\nAnd pushing people out of cars so Gerard ... is this going to happen could we see the Trump Administration say let's freeze the standards now when if you frozen standards\nWouldn't affect me if prices stopped going up on cars more people buying new cars more fuel efficient cars already because we know that a ten year old car is not going to get as good gas mileage\nAs the one that's brand spanking new or a year or two old if we could\nStop that and just say let's just freeze the standards or has come as close to a freezes possible on all the new standards were pushing the car companies to get there\nIf we could reduce the cost of to the American family uh buying an automobile more of them would buy brand new ones that means more van would have new were cars a year or two or three or five years old\nAnd we can reduce that Thirteen your average age back to something lower than that we'd get cleaner air we'd get more fuel efficiency\nAnd we wouldn't have to batter the consumer with these gigantic price increases\nAbsolutely not just the consumer but our auto makers their competitiveness our jobs are you know our economy it hits it hits all the way down and the ridiculous idea is that as you said earlier because you've got to\nGet that average you're going to sell cars the smaller cars which are not as profitable but you want a skill away from the\nUm cars that are the bigger cars that are more comfortable and have more features that people want they'll actually increase the price of those to push people into lower cars so it really skews the market at squares profitability\nOf it you know screws up all of the various ways that the economy should be running with consumer choice and auto makers\nMaking vehicles that people actually want to drive and were you living in a gray days right now or technology is doing amazing things with a you know crash warnings and laying changing and break assessed and all and all that good stuff that's making cars safer but with these crazy CAFE standards they are going to keep people out of these cars and\nThey're going to hold onto their car much longer um which is not only less fuel efficient but it's also less safe\nWell and it and that's a big difference because they say when you get to smaller cars for every hundred pounds you trim off the car you say well that's more efficient and say it's also five percent more likely to kill you in a crash\nAnd and frankly I Know that they knew they couldn't go out and say we're going to make it illegal for you to buy a pickup truck or an SUV unless you can prove your family needs that they couldn't get away with that what would they could do is say that new pickup truck or if she is going to cost you fifty sixty Seventy thousand dollars\nAnd they knew consumers would say all of that expensive all by the small car\nGerard keep up the good work at a consumer action for a stronger economy

Fifteen eight eight eight ten the right so it's kind of pages where they knew we could say we covered that story was on page eight ten right there\nIn front of God and everybody in and nobody actually saw it but the Beto O'Rourke stories sounds like a very interesting one we've talked about it in passing on this program but he\nLied about a DUI arrest\nAh when when he was younger and and the fact is he tried to run away from the scene and you would think that kind of scandal with dogs somebody and until and unless he actually makes a clean breast of it and says yeah it happened I did the wrong thing he can he can resolve this one pretty ... pretty quickly couldn't they\nJust say ... you say you know are they in a mistake when he was younger uh is that he chose to lie about about the ... say they and and\nUh when in fact that the liberal Washington Post who is actually fairly debate or they actually is a bad check a said that they do or the game for ... you know he knows that said that you know that he clearly lied about ...\nUh the arrest or this is this this is lie of the interest\nDidn't make any of the major three network evening all morning shows or even Sunday roundtable shows what's even worse is that a a CBS this morning toast you know what he got she interviewed better wrote on October fifth\nAh and never brought up the fact that he had a DUI arrest\nOr you'd think that that ... some hot material let's talk about Senator Claire McCaskill has been and what he did with this government program\nOkay so there's a I'll Try to simplify it is actually there is a tax credit\nProgram that's intended to help a a bill the house is a housing for the poor a and a ...\n... ... Joseph Saddam shepherd was clearly center of cutter McCaskill husband dead is he a bottom all these tax credits that again or post the to help build cheap housing for the poor and he flipped him do other developers and end up earning like you know millions of dollars\nA by doing that so he basically took of an joke of a program that was a candidate help the poor you know liberal Democrats both go by helping to porches I slip them said personally and ...\nAnd ... and in that case all he was was an intermediary you you know he he didn't actually do anything he just buys the tax credits up and then flip them to other developers he was a marketing guy and he pulled a profit off that\nExactly now it's crazy a finely teeth Alison I still don't understand why the major media is a dog in this one except for the fact that Keith ...

other thing is is that uh uh they took a a twenty three billion dollars or more I guess it could be eighty eight if you really follow the math\nOn it diluted\nThe a U.S a shareholder or or worldwide shareholders in a General Motors and stepped in line and in a paid off the campaign deaths\nAnd uh uh they were sued by a a teachers' unions police unions a civil action suits\nA against that and uh um uh uh but nobody nobody uh uh squawks about that and ah they they executed\nOne of the worst crimes on the American taxpayer ever and and uh a liberal so come around and they all talked about a Reaganomics or or even a tax cut\nA but is there it on their example of a Reaganomics given to the rich and it trickles down her any bigger exam\nIs there any bigger example of of a given money to a printing money now borrowing and not moving from one place to the other but printing money and given it to banks and hoping they lend it which they could not\nI don't think there is a good example of that and that's the thing that's all he does what's it called Keynesian economics economics but the idea being\nThat if you prime the pump up the economy by injecting a bunch of free money that that will make the pump start turning and that when you do that or start producing a a result that when you do that to the economy\nThat it'll actually jak the economy up and then the economy will run on its own it's a lot like believing a perpetual motion machine and it doesn't make sense it doesn't work\nBut that's an issue that needs to be resolved by each country or if your government is persecuting you because you're gay or because you're a different religion or whatever I understand that but even then\nIf the standard was uh the economy stinks and there are a lot of ... there's a lot of criminal activity\nHow many of the seven billion people on planet earth might be able to credible you say you know those things are lousy back home I'd like to go somewhere else I Would imagine it'd be a very large number\n[noise] yeah and and that's the key point that ... that of course is\nMissing from the higher and higher or whatever we talk about the care of the press never seen that they can set of facts has an ... or ... million people I'm sure all of them I Love to come to the United states\nAnd we let them all at a ... we could I mean it would completely over on the United states if we allow that to happen so we have to put the laws in place that we have to like\n... or so so you know ... and you mentioned the seven billion people around the world about you know thirty to fifty percent of them were also love to cover the United states that that that that probably has always helped people back in their home countries try to help their economy improves try to help the government\nGet control of a criminal activity that happens when you take place there and that's what President Trump seems to be threatening right now I he he is apparently told the president of hot Dora hey what kind of all federal funding if you guys don't stop this caravan heading up to the United states or the ... has an effect\n... is deputy director of numbers usa which does great work\nOn immigration issues because by that standard I Would imagine that if the current victims of criminal gangs you know of all of them could get together and a caravan it'd probably be\nTens or even hundreds of thousands of people and if they left I'm sure the criminal gangs don't go out of business they just turn to the next set of victims until what until you've emptied the country\nSo so it's really not a ... it's not a solution and I think\nI'd even make the case Christian you tell me what to think of this argument that if you take some of the pressure off or country by having some of the people in the worst situation leave knowing that there are still nine million people that those criminal gangs can pick on and steal from because that's what they do for a you know for a living to get them get their money\nThat in some ways you may actually put the solution farther away because the folks who are most vocal most willing to pick up and pack up and leave and go somewhere else or they aren't going to get rid of the the folks who are actually doing the bad acts but they will they may take the pressure off the government to try to fix the reforms and\nRight right I mean there are certainly people that are that are using file all\nThat will probably use the caravan and we've seen it I care of that there are some bad folks that will ... fan and and and try to take advantage of of the fact that you know this caravan coming up they're going to get some are going to get attached and they're going to have\nThe benefit of food and water it's going to make that make the track through through Mexico to the U.S Mexico border but\nBut but but the vast majority of them are ... are good people or people that are willing to work you know they're willing to help out a ... ... ... it's ... ... that's happening out there and and a lot of it is is the responsibility of the government the government now and has\nDone it stops I take a bite him out of us said that that are out there\nYou got these folks leaving the country is going to benefit the country in the long\nNo one Chris thanks so much for having me\nThat's Chris ... numbers usa to your calls now Dan's on the line
