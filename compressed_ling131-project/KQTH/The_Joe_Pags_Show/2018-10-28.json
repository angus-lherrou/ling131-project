conspiracy theory Thursday night we call a dad because on Thursdays we usually hear at least a conspiracy theory or two\nI gave you a mind yesterday I think that this bomber is either a full on not or a Democrat if that's not being ... and uh and I have a feeling\nThat the reason it's being done is\nTo try to draw sympathy to the Democratic party that thought it was going to get a big fast blue wave in the November midterm elections and I think they're going to be very disappointed in fact most of them are already starting to talk down expectations for November the sex\nAnd on the border the secretary of defense James Mattis is expected to send and is sending he says eight hundred to a thousand troops to the U.S Mexico border not remember\nThey go down there and joins some of the forty thousand or so\nA border patrol officers were already there parts of the border are already shut off by barriers of one kind or another and I have a feeling that if more military help is needed Donald Trump will be selling it and sending it in a world where bombs and harassment are commonplace oh by the way before I started into this\nChristian nails in the head of the department of homeland security is just told Fox News that\nViolence against the border agents will not be tolerated now you can translate that any way you want but the way I see it she's sending a message that if the caravan of people's shows up\nAnd they insist on forcing their way into our country the way you can see them on YouTube forcing their way into Guatemala and then out of Guatemala into Mexico if they plan that kind of rush for the border\nI have a feeling they're going to be met by enough force to make sure that they do not come into this country\nAnd if you don't like that look at some of the interviews and I've listened to as many as I can get my hands on her in my ears on\nAnd what I'm hearing from people is I'm a hard worker I Want to go there and work or it's really a lousy economy in

... a lot about Veterans Affairs on this program because we've known as a country for a long time that the VA has\nNot delivered the kind of health care that you might expect I Know that some of ... veterans have had ... tests\nThe the VA has not delivered the kind of health care that you might expect I Know that some of you veterans have had fantastic healthcare from the VA unfortunately we've had too many veterans who literally died while waiting in line metaphorical line that is\nBeing put on a weightless somewhere and that's just not not right well I Believe that's being corrected by changing the law and buy a new ... during the secretary Robert Wilkie who's been nice enough to join his before secretary welcome back to the program\nWell thank you Lars thank you for having\nUser new development in the form of an online portal that's actually going to make veterans' health care veteran can you please tell my audience about that\nYes we'll be launching in the next few weeks of the first phase of a V. A. dot Gov which will be\nA place for veterans to get information on everything from health care to education benefits you know the last time I thought\nWe have we talked about the having hundreds of eight hundred numbers hundreds of of links to different websites that that made the process of actually getting in to the system almost unbearable so this is the first of a a two pronged solved\nThat we will be making on that that the second is what is going on right up there\nIn the Pacific northwest in Washington state and later in Alaska where we will be a beta testing\nThe electronic health record which will for the first time connect a veteran from the time that he enters the military processing center as a young recruit the highly walks into into VA that will revolutionize the way we provide cover\nWhy why do you think it's taken so long to get to that when you would think that the people working within the ... system would have said we wish we had the same kind of capabilities that you know the average or retail company out there in America has right\n[noise] well I think lawyers and it's something that you you talked about\nFor years and then you get major living on the preaching free market ideas and appreciate preaching the notion that uh if we're going to have official government if that is possible\nIt has to be closest to the people that government serves and a BA has been a typical government institution there are hundreds of thousands of good people who joined VA\nBecause they want to serve veterans but they've been held back by\nUh nineteenth century prophecies and regulations and a beautiful thing about where we are today is that we've got a president who does not care\nAbout what went on in the past I mean he ah I think somebody else was called the great disruptor but he certainly has when it comes to that this system and he's he's not going to tolerate business as\nWell and so secretary well ... I'm sure that some people are going to hear this is a great computers that's going to cost a bundle of money but at the end of the day does it have the potential not only to deliver great care which is what we care most about but also potentially to be more efficient and less costly than the current system\nIt it does it does in the sense that it\nWill provide us rapid scheduling it will and this is the most important part and the president will be announcing reforms in the state of the union in January\nThis will be the basis for the opening of that amateur when it comes to veterans choice and health care and that's the ability\nThe basis for the opening of that ad but sure when it comes to veterans choice and health care\nAnd that's the ability of the veteran not to be tied to a system that maybe ... miles and miles away from his home it's going to be a system that\nIn many cases almost all will allow that veteran to choose whether or not it's better for him to get care closer to home than in the VA center I'm that's what's truly revolutionary about what's coming and the beauty of that\nIs that we do have a consensus from the Congress they've given me\nAs the secretary the authority to create this new system the president is on board and you know it's right in line with with our philosophy of government a government that serves as it is singularly\nDesigned to sir of those people we are mandated to help\nWill secretary well can you tell me that is because I imagine that most of the pushback from any of these kinds of changes like a long vets to access private medical care from the system that serves the rest of us\nI've had veterans tell me themselves that they had good results\nBy going that way when the VA has been willing to pay for it but I Would imagine it also has the potential for some VA employees to lose their jobs you have all of a sudden you know all the local hospital the local civilian hospital is doing a lot more one kind of procedure another and it's not being done at the VA center that means jobs and typically the unions have fought against that\nHave you managed to conquer that part of the problem\nRight well the president has been very clear about um the glaciers ship with with our unions and he has said that there is no prerogative is no prerogative for unions or any other group federal employees in general\nUm within that prerogative comes in between a veteran and health\nAnd we have said that clearly the president does move of course\nWe are now hung up in the courts that that's to be expected a you know we we're we're blessed with a lot of dedicated work but um we are very clear that a union members who are medical professionals in the day\nIf they're going to stay they have to devote their time to take care of patients not spending as as some do actually many some nurses doctors\nSpend a hundred percent of their time doing the work that's not what a veterans expect that's not what the public expects them that's certainly not with the um the president the United states demands\nLet me ask you about something this is another issue that came up and is Nathaniel Bedford Forrest I remember that name from both you know junior high school and high school there was a portrait of that man who was a Confederate general uh he but he also became the KKK is first figurehead Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd one of your employees a deputy director of zero VA offices small disadvantage business utilization had that portrait up in his office but he said I didn't know that he was connected to the KKK and so they've taken this down\nYou know on one hand I understand why somebody who knows history that well might be offended by on the other hand it just seems like this is where where scrubbing every bit of American history and most of our history is filled with people who would not be politically correct by today's standards\nDo we end up scrubbing all of the history and I wanted to get your take on on on the fact that there was a little controversy about this\nRight well let me tell you how I was addressed it now first of all is that place of this\nOn the fact that there was a little controversy about this\nRight well let me tell you how I was ... now first of all is that place um this individual uh pictures of George Washington and what have you lived in his office right as soon as someone complained he took it down so there's there's no complaint with\nThe impact he he moved it\nUm and that's what he did write I'm I'll tell you how I'll address this um when I was\nA for confirmation a there are several members of Congress who are demanding that Mr Lincoln's words\nFrom his second inauguration a great great where he says that we shall take care of those who have borne the battle and his widow in Austin or be taken down from the VA really um I actually have those uh yes I actually have those words\nThey want to get Trump for for the non existent Russian collusion or write their section three of the federal criminal code but but James Buckingham\nCouldn't make it to section three never got there oh it's crazy there's no way we can go after the sanctuary cities yeah it took me six seconds on Google on Google defined accessory after the fact\nWell an end you pointed out and I remember the fight we're Arizona said if you're not going to enforce the immigration laws we Arizona will under a good governor and the Obama administration fought it tooth and nail and at least in the corner one and they want under the premise that only the federal government can enforce immigration laws\nAnd you would think that that that would make it very clear about the other thing that occurred to me you're a lawyer as you point out in the column and if we pointed out before but isn't there an equal protection issue here I don't suppose the rest of us who are legal citizens of the United states could bring a massive\nUh you know go to a case against a class action case saying we're being denied equal treatment under the law if a certain class of people get one kind of treatment under the law and American citizens get lesser treatment believer and\nThat's actually a really great idea of one of the grounds on which it's illegal to ... to discriminate as place of birth and nationality I'm In this case I mean the assumption was discriminating against people who weren't your fellow citizens no it's just the exact\nOpposite on people who are not our fellow citizens who commit crimes are being treated better by prosecutors are less likely to be charged with charges at all or charged with\nAh the maximum crime they can be charged with in order to to make sure they stay here we got to keep the criminals here\nWell and and you know that there are at least a couple of places in America they are going to have a vote on this on November the six to get rid of sanctuary status and I think the voters are going to vote to get rid of it but how do we convince\nSay the New York times which things that is terrible that Jeff Sessions we'd go to one of his deputies and say would you please research those and then and then the the New York times is an outrage from the deputy comes running says no I couldn't find anything like that and the law and you find it in six seconds on Google\nIt it's it's pretty amazing but there is an element on the left ah it it's been with us for a long time ago just hate America whether they were um you know selling selling or giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union rooting for the Soviet Union over our own country um to today\nWhere they are rooting for the caravan to come across they just want to destroy the country now I think most elected Democrats um aren't that hateful aren't driven by a passion to destroy our country but they're certainly bucks out by those people and and\nThe position of most elected Democrats is um number one ah the the the masses of third world are pouring into our country oh well look they vote for the Democrats were all for them and number two it's just gotten to the point that whatever Trump is for their against it's worth mentioning that\nNot very long ago Harry Reid Dianne Feinstein even Iraq Obama were against this influx of illegal immigrants bringing their path olive jeez I'm their poverty their medical problems to our country when we have our own people with path allergies poverty and health problems that we need to take care of\nAnd in fact we've been running that sound but I mean it's it's amazing that the New York times is forgotten the great ... Hussein Obama\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently and walk away or the become immigrants\nAnd circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the become immigrants in this country\nI guess the editors over the old grey lady just forgot all about that happening just a couple of years ago and congratulations on the success of resistance is futile how the Trump petting left has lost its collective mind and I appreciate your time today and I feel ours by nice to talk to you as well that's in colder weathers\nBy the way how does a great night sleep improve your performance I can tell you personally\nI get a great night sleep every night and Tina and I have\nIn a week we will celebrate Twenty years of sleeping on sleep number beds\nHow 'bout more energy everyday less brain for a better mood and more productivity well they do sleep number three sixty smart bed helps everybody from parents to pro athletes to talk show host improve their daily performance through great sleep my sleep number setting is sixty five Tina's is thirty five or forty\nBut that's the beauty of it so many couples disagree on mattress firmness well sleep number beds let you choose your ideal furnace on each side so it's just right for both of you the new beds are so smart they sent your every move and they automatically adjust to you that keeps you sleeping comfortably all night long\nCome in and see the new asleep number three sixty smart bet it's your competitive edge from nine hundred Ninety nine dollars sleep numbers the officials sleep and wellness partner of the NFL and the Lars Larson Joe you'll only find sleep number at one of their five hundred and fifty sleep numbers stores\nNationwide visited sleeve number dot com slash Lars defined the store near you when we come back we'll get to your phone calls and emails at eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk Lars Larson dot com [noise]\n\n\nAn official methods for Medicare open enrollment than so now's the time to reopen might look at everything my prescription drug crimes and Medicare Advantage plans I'm having insurers why because climb straight soak in your house that I found lower costs arm extra benefits aren't saved money open to something better\nVisit Medicare's got a call one eight hundred Medicare today is on the ...\nPaid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services [noise]\nHere's\nThe cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America is affected by hard water contains harsh mineral that can try out skin and hair hard water can raise our electricity bill by up to forty eight percent even create hill that in life that can lead to pathogenic bacteria\nStressed out yet don't be felt based ...\nCan solve all your hard water as you\nGet the full scoop at a little salt\nNoted author former chief medical correspondent and salon policies are Dr Bob are not\nThe human body has billions of pain receptors block those receptors with the anesthetics founded salon ... plus and you'll have relief\nSalon pies light again plus contains two anesthetics including the maximum strength lie to gain available that a prescription they numb aggravated nurse for effective lasting relief for only try what I use salon paused light again plus\nIn silver box with a blue wave\nHere's the story of Laura ... wants to play for his parents his love of the game and then in college\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nThe trumpet at a time\nI was never that good a good mom gave up by the time I go\nBut he also learned how to get to see them a lot of money on car insurance so he switched didn't say so what is your story has a happy ending after all\n\nThe time but I ... in Ryder card checking motorcycle show November third from eight am before he and I think he knows what kind of playing his family friendly car show is the largest one day showing southern Arizona\nTrucking benefit our protectors mentally Miranda ... la county sheriff's department free admission and tons of free parking register your vehicle show detail by visiting protecting our protectors dot org ...

to find they believe that that's the processing center where some of the bombs went through that have caused such a stir the last three days\nIn the United states of America are but in other news we've got other things going on and when they catch this dirty dog who sent these bombs and frankly I Want him cut no matter what's motivating it\nLike last night's Twitter poll he could be a garden variety not could be a foreign actor could be somebody from the left trying to make the left a little more sympathetic heading in the election could be somebody from the right who just doesn't like Soros and Clinton and Obama and waters and the rest of that crowd\nNo matter what the motivation is the person who would send those bombs in the mail is a dirty dog deserves to be caught indicted convicted and put in a deep dark hole probably for the rest of his life\nLos Angeles can barely manage the money for its employees retirement fund which makes their recent ballot measure sound like a

it was a story commissioned by the New York times a piece of fiction to be sure written by Zoe sharp\nThat ends with the murder the assassination of President Trump and involves the secret service agent actually handing over his gun to a Russian assassin killed Trump I Know you say that's silly it is silly\nBut for a newspaper that is now begging that America heal the divisions and come back together to be publishing fictional fantasies what I Would call assassination porn because they hate Donald Trump\nAbsolutely out of line and I'd ask you could you ever imagine the New York times

[noise]\n\nWarning winger coming on lawyers worse in the show welcome back to the Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you and I'm Glad to get your phone calls\nAnd your emails that eight six six eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com and I told you that we are going to talk about the uh the bombs are we had expected to talk to a Brian Maloney but apparently he's unavailable tonight\nLet me share just a bit of what he had to say about\nWhat is coming and whether or not this is the October surprise that we see so frequently from primarily from left although I looked at looked at the history\nAnd I had to remind myself to run a few October surprises from the Republican side as well\nUh but what he wrote was the discovery multiple explosive devices addressed a prominent Democrats across the U.S today has the potential to be the kind of October surprise\nThey could up in the mid term elections and maybe even affect the balance of power William Casey campaign manager for Ronald Reagan's Nineteen eighty presidential campaign is said to have ... coined the term in the eighties although there were some earlier than that\nThe concept of an eleventh hour revelation or event that could scramble every singing the month before Americans go to the polls predates the term previous October surprises have happened twenty sixteen Access Hollywood\nTwenty twelve the Romney forty seven percent I didn't agree with Romney about much but I agreed with him about that what he was talking about was the forty seven percent of Americans who earn a paycheck and pay zero federal income taxes yeah\nAnd he was criticized for saying those people you know who pay no federal income taxes don't care whether income taxes go up or down in two thousand eight the market crash you know six the representative Mark Foley scandal which you feel remember fully was a Republican he sent some text messages that were\nYou recall election and in two thousand a really odd one because apparently even if you fully admit that you've done something wrong the surprise was the October surprise in two thousand was George Bush had a drunk driving ticket when he was in college and he was I think twenty eight years old\nAnd he didn't try to make any excuses he said yeah I did I did get a drunk driving ticket and you know what he decided to do right after that probably the most admirable thing that anybody with a drunk driving chicken can do is say I'm going to quit drinking\nAnd he quit drinking period for the rest of his life and this was a long time later obviously he was running for president in two thousand and he said I'm going to quit I quit drinking right after that ... I was drinking too much and decided to quit the booze\nNow you'd almost think that that kind of answer would get you more plaudits that it would critics but you know that was one of the October surprise in any case is this the October surprise I guess it will depend on who it ends up is\nResponsible for those bombs if it turns out to be somebody with a Muslim surname I have a feeling that's only going to amp up the president's supporters if it turns out that it's a right wing not somebody who is allied with the conservatives then you're going to get the Democrats doing something really odd and really two faced\nBecause they will say well if this was a conservative than the blame goes to Trump\nWhich is a bit akin to saying well if it's a lefty\nWho commits an assassination or commits a terrible crime then the blame falls on all left days and you understand there is a double standard in the media about that you can cite example after example where the media will say well just because this happened involving one left wing or doesn't mean you blame everyone\nAnd they especially do that if you have an act of terrorism carried out by somebody who's a follower of Islam They say you can't blame all of Islam for the actions of one member of Islam\nBoy if one person with a gun commits a crime than all gun owners are suspect that's the double standard that we routinely see from the left wing media and believe me\nNo matter who they catch and I expect they will catch somebody fairly soon involved with these bombs or devices most some of them were not active bombs at all they were just devices made to look like bombs no matter who it is I think\nThat CNN and MSNBC and the New York times the Washington Post will try to find a way to blame it on President Trump let's go to mark and mark welcome to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind tonight\nFlorida in ... years love ya thank you very much shrouded\nNo problem I got I got out of a question and it's becoming a cross my mind for a while with all the rhetoric cholesterol on out inciting violence on April to kick 'em while they're down yet I go on and on call and thanks\nDid it ever make you wander it's been making me wonder are they are they ... is the last Bush in for another civil war I mean they're even all the people from other countries\nYou remember the Democrats lost the last civil war ah [laughter]\nAnd and the Republicans won\nAnd thank goodness for that uh but but are they pushing for another and by the way they'll tell you all those weren't the Democrats have today Oh yes they are now we can watch a couple of the national Susan movies\nAnd you'll see the evidence that I have to give great credit to punish for being able to do that but do they want another confrontation I think they think\nThat's the only way to remove this president and here's the case I'd make\nThey demanded in September of twenty sixteen Donald Trump you have to say that\nWay to remove this president and here's the case I'd make\nThey demanded in September of twenty sixteen Donald Trump you have to say that you will accept the results of the election now that demand came from none other than Hillary Clinton\nAnd yet at the same time reporters weren't asking Hillary because they didn't think it was possible Hillary if the election doesn't go your way will you accept the results of the election they never asked the question\nAnd why because nobody nobody in the mainstream media thought it was going to go that way I did I thought it was going to go to Donald Trump and so did a lot of other people and obviously enough Americans voted for him that he won the presidency and they went nuts on the night of November the twenty sixteen they said we can't accept this result\nAnd I've always been proud that I live in a country where there's a peaceful transition of power or it has been up till now\nAnd we said you have an election and no matter whether you like the results are not you accept the new president and if a sitting president gets beat after four years you accept the new president\nAnd if a president served two terms I think at this point Donald Trump is the odds on favorite to serve a second term and that election is still two years away but they went nuts\nAnd they immediately that night and the next morning began saying we have to impeach him and I don't know if you remember this or not\nBut in just in December and January the Democrats vowed we will never even let him take off as we will find a legal way or some other way to prevent him from even taking the oath of office and then we got past the inauguration and they burned a few cars the left did you know all the pink hat wearing ladies\nBurned cars and ... you know bright and in the streets\nAnd that didn't do any good and then they said well we'll get him some other way we'll have him investigated for years on a baseless allegation that somehow he colluded with the Russians were going to get ... I guess some of the results of that from the mall or investigation as soon as we get past the elections\nAnd I think the only reason they're not leaking out right now although that could be the last minute October surprise\nMuller is said he'll hold it until after the election\nIf you hear stuff starts to leak before the election from the mall or investigation this will prove the point that a lot of us believe and that is the deep state is at work in America and the deep state has benefited both the left and the right at various times\nIf Mueller's investigation leagues and the parts they leak say he's going to announce after the election that Donald Trump has been involved in some kind of collusion look they've been running a collusion hobby horse for two years more than two years now\nAnd they haven't waited new law well I I don't care if it went ten years but the the real test is and how long ago when the real test is\nA ... a hold on to riverside doctor they'd have to have the house the Senate and the signature on the resolute desk right\nYes um what they're going to have a very difficult time doing that a particularly if the Senate maintains control Republican control and President Trump won't won't sign it but there are some things that the house can do a true resolution buy them themselves\nEven if they don't raise\nTaxes uh they're certainly not going to support President Trump's latest plan which says we should I look for another tax cut this one geared a little more toward\nConsumers rather than business the last tax cut\nThe the purpose of it was to increase economic growth and then indeed that now to increase economic growth we have a capital intensive economy so to increase economic growth you have to create new capital he did that by reducing corporate tax rate\nFrom an average of thirty five percent down\nTo Twenty one percent and eat a reduced personal income taxes for everybody including the upper class and the upper classes the one that creates new\nCapitals so the first tax cut was geared to economic growth\nUm there is a feeling that uh the higher income people and they did made out better than um middle income people so now Trump is pushing um another middle class tax cut if the Republicans maintain control both houses\nUm another middle class tax cut\nThe Republicans maintain control both houses he's likely to get that if the day he died if they're Republicans don't he's not likely to get that and I think the uh uh investor community as saying a look all the famous Trump has been doing to stimulate growth which appear to be working\nI don't have a difficult time keeping that up if the house of representatives flip\nDr ... let me ask you why do we need to cool down the economy I understand the concern about inflation\nBut the fan of says gee the economy is doing too well we're growing too fast well water use too fast and can we grow without having too much inflation would a little bit of inflation right now necessarily be a bad thing we we didn't have much inflation\nDuring all of the eight years of Obama before making a briefing on to it would it would it be that bad if we had a little bit of inflation along with a massive amount of road if the fed would stop crunching the economy\n[laughter] you know it's funny I just wrote a column in the hill a few days ago arguing that uh exact point the twelve month inflation rate\nFor the last couple of months out higher than Spanish and the two point seven range but it has been inching down a little bit because we've pushed interest rates up new home sales the last\nFive months of death existing home sales have death so\nI'm there doesn't look to be any inflationary pressures yet and I think the Federal Reserve is over reacting\nTo this similar to what you just\nSaid we can get much higher quote the Ronald Reagan cut taxes in Nineteen eighty one went into effect in Nineteen eighty two Trump models his tax cut after Reagan right when Reagan tax cut went in and eighty two in Nineteen eighty four\nThe economy had an annual growth rate of seven and a half percent\nSo the fact that we're up in the four range and tomorrow the third quarter number comes out will probably be in a high three we're nowhere near as overheated\nEconomy the Federal Reserve I I Believe is over reacting to this they should do a little more slowly with interest rates that is true interest rates are still below historical normal but they've gone up so fast that ah we're having a negative impact on interest\nA sensitive sectors like housing and automobiles\nSee Dr ... that's the concern I've got is that and I and I'm Wondering let me ask you straight out do you think the fed is reacting only because of the metrics or are they reacting somewhat politically as well to to crush on the economy that is making Donald Trump look like a chance\nI certainly hope it ... or I don't I Hope they're not trying to\nCrush the economy a President Trump appointed a Jerome Powell to be a chairman a so he's got his person in there and always been a little critical of them uh lately I I'm not sure what the motivation is but they don't need to do this\nAs fast as they're they're doing it yeah um I ... rates were under four percent there now approaching five percent that's going to hurt the the housing market\n...

so this will be interesting you know Trump is threatened this and this caravan is that anywhere between eight and ten thousand depending on who you're talking to and and it's you know it's funny this is where like the the crazy right and the crazy left there they've always got the conspiracy theories you know and the [laughter]\nIt's a it's for owes the Soros is funding this or it's you know the Democrats have put this together and so what you found ten thousand crisis act or people that are willing to make a treacherous walk from wherever to here is is that what it is I'm just I'm curious\nLike I'm curious about I'm not saying that there's not people along the way that aren't there to help but I'm saying how do you go about in doing that how do you get that many people that are willing to to jump on board is their contract you sign I'm just you know it's just\nI I think we're allowed to be curious I I don't know what's gonna happen they're they're having issues some small

and you'll find some saying towards the Texas side some will head towards Arizona some other ones are towards California\nBut I just I I don't know\nI don't know and this is one of those things where it's like is a perfect example\nWhere I was talking earlier somebody of of you know most of the time when I talked to somebody who we differ politically\nOn certain things and I think most of you guys if you you were smart enough to understand that because I like to think that my my my listeners and people will pay attention are\nSmarter than the average bear and even if they're politically they slant one side and it's pretty solid they're open minded enough you know more often than not we want to get to the same place we just differ on the directions we want to take\nRight\nSome of us want to get there as an individual some of us want to get there on the bus some of us want to get I mean some of us are gonna walk there we we want to get a lot of times the same place it's just\nThe way that we the ... that we're going to take how we're going to get there and who's going to pay for it along the way and I think that\nThe more if we start looking at things like hey that's a that's a good you're right we do want to get there we do want good education we do want how I have yet to run in somebody in in on the Republican side of the aisle\nThat's a that's a good you're right we do want to get there we do want good education we do want how I have yet to run in somebody in in on the Republican side of the aisle if you will but says oh I Would like for for nobody to have health care\nI think everybody would like to for everybody to have health care it's just the way that they want it done is they like the individual to be a part of this and they understand but there are people out there that are capable for whatever reasons in certain circumstances that they're never going to be able to themselves and for that they've got no problem\nAnd the other side is like well
