have no place in the United states of America [noise]\nIs president Donald Trump speaking just a few hours ago about the bombs or explosive devices that have been received that a number of places around America including New York city and about the reaction to it and as you know I'm going to make the case\nThat we don't know at this point who set those devices into the mail and who's responsible for those devices but I can tell you this that the actual political violence that have been carried out in this country over the last several years are almost exclusively from the left\nAnd if you don't like that then called me up and tell me that it was a lefty who shot up Republicans on a baseball field and nearly killed Congressman Steve college tell me that it was somebody from the right who committed the acts\nSmall field and nearly killed Congress in Steve's college tell me that it was somebody from the right who committed the acts that ... has been involved in in major American cities\nYou know there's such a long list of the things that have happened in this country or the left has acted in a violent way and we've seen the likes of Maxine Waters members of member of Congress encouraging violence former attorney general and Democrat Eric Holder encouraging acts of political violence\nWe've seen all of those and we've heard their cries even Hillary Clinton most recently and I'll play the sound bite a little bit later on where Hillary Clinton said you cannot be civil when you are opposing what the Republicans are doing to this country\nAnd civility will return when you've returned political power to the Democratic party in America those are the voices that are calling for violence Eric Holder saying when they go low we kick them\nNow you tell me who's encouraging the political violence and then when you hear about this report that\nPackages were mailed to the Clintons bill and Hillary to the Obamas Michelle in Iraq to CNN and to others and then you say who do you think did it well I'm going to ask you who did our Twitter poll tonight\nWho do you think is responsible for the bombs today and yesterday to George Soros in Bedford

twin civility can start again\nI Would be willing to bet that Hillary Rodham Clinton is now ruining the day that she made those comments not too long ago saying that civility is only going to return when Democrats are given the reins of power again welcome back to the Lars Larson shows so many reactions today\nTo these devices that have arrived in the mail to George Soros to the Clintons to the Obamas to John Brennan the Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd perhaps that was an accident we don't know her name was on the return address but I thought we'd find out more about where these bombs might have come from steamboat choose a visiting fellow at the ... Institute for foreign policy and national security and a retired army special forces officer and a top Pentagon official\nA Steve thanks for your service to American uniformed thanks for taking the\nTime tonight shirt thanks for having me back on the show so tell me this ... do you have do we have any ... uh from what we know today about these these devices that\nWere delivered earlier today and discovered a where they might be coming from or what they might be motivated by\nSort of thing leaves a lot of travels a lot more than most people realize\nA and you know not everybody is is lucky as the Unabomber was stay out there as long as he did a most of these folks get caught pretty quickly so\nI I think while we don't know yet they haven't announced any of it properly or ... I think there there probably are on the trail of whoever did this\nI Would expect that is true too and while I'm not an expert on crime scene investigation things like that over the years I've read too many stories about\nFolks who build explosive devices and they tend to leave all kinds of of evidence inside of them whether it's DNA whether it's fingerprint whether it's just the source of the materials that they're able to track down unless you're very careful as a bomb maker I Would imagine you're going to leave those kinds of hints and clues that might take a\nAnd this is clearly going to be the focus of a lot of Americans you know law enforcement uh until this is solved\nOr the ... I I think you're right they are going to track this back\nTo the person who sent them I'm kinda curious about whether or not you think at this point we can make an educated guess\nAbout what might be motivating and since these devices arrived\nA exclusively at the addresses of of prominent Democrat and liberal politicians in America we initially heard a report the door device and sent to the White House that was quickly pulled back\nAnd it was it exclusively the Soros Clinton's Obama's John Brennan of\nWho I think would probably resist any kind of title but I think I could go on to a you know a a a tool of left at this point\nI'm said that because they were sent a Democrat you might think well then the source must have been conservative but it could also be uh something designed to bring some kind of sympathy or a fold flag and I don't ordinarily believe unfolds flags\nAs we are less than two weeks before an election\n[noise] yeah I I think you're right I mean in the same way that you know when that guy shot up the Republican House\nSoftball teams ... is a it was highly likely that that person who's going to turn out to be somebody really didn't like Republicans are and as it turned out that was the case\nOr in this case I think of the first to fall position is obviously this is somebody who is not particularly enamored\nTo people with strong liberal leanings and or people that are overly critical of President Trump but we can't really make that determination until we get other corroborating evidence that says that ah you know the fact that not one of the devices\nWent off they were all discovered\nI tell you maybe they weren't intended to go off maybe this was a false flag we don't know uh you know fortunately looking at the pictures that I've seen is devices and we're not exactly you know rocket science kind of a formation and it was they were pretty crude\nAs one of my colleagues Jim ... said today that the picture of the passage of the bomb will probably go down\nIn in some FBI class saying\nThis is what a pipe bomb in the mail will look like it was you know that\nKind of obvious that that there was something there it has to do more investigation on but we won't now and we shouldn't really make any can draw any conclusions into law enforcement finishes his investigation and we find out what the real motivation\nOf whoever did this was\nKnow Steve you had the same reaction I did when I saw that sort of crumbled a manila envelope and and you know that putting a pipe inside of that\nYou know Steve you had the same reaction I did when I saw that sort of crumbled a manila envelope and and you know that putting a pipe inside of that before anybody even open to your immediately going to wonder what is very have really\nFeels like a steel pipe inside of an envelope maybe in addition to not intending for them to go off you wanted them to be discovered fairly early whereas\nI have a couple of boxes sitting on my studio desk right now that are from Amazon Prime I don't even know what's inside of them and occasionally\nMy wife orders and things that are particularly heavy but if they're packed inside a box I don't know what's in there and you can see it from the outside you'd think if somebody wanted a bomb to make itself make its way all the way inside somebody's office packing it that way\nWould would uh you know would actually conceal it but if you wanted it to be discovered early on before and we all know the pipe bombs can go off inadvertently maybe would package it exactly that way so that it would be immediately recognized as a suspicious package\n[noise] yeah they you know one of the things we need to wait for is the you know the FBI investigation as a device itself because they'll be able to tell a lot from that you know they they intend for it to go off what do they have operated the way they thought it would\nOr would it be something like that bomb that was in\nThe trunk of the car in times square where the guy who thought he had made a really effective big bomb and you know he just fail they couldn't follow the Internet instructions or you know so we'll we'll have to say about that and then as we talked about the other forensic clues that should be in there\nThe mail you know I'll be honest with you I'm surprised the post office males those things\nBecause they're usually pretty good right when you step up to the counter asking all those questions seal and the thing you know and if you don't give them legitimate answers\nThat gives them a feeling of comfort that they will ... what\nA and and this kind of looked like something suspicious in the passage to me that you know hindsight's always twenty twenty so we'll we'll see where it goes but uh it's a little early to draw conclusions\nAre and attach political motivation to it but now it it sure looks like there's some politics involved on one side or the other\nI Would think so too and Steve I've had that same problem when you have to convince the post office it's not a bottle of whiskey or sending to a friend but actually a bottle of olive oil you know and if you can't be convincing [laughter] they're not they're not going to and neither is FedEx either they won't take it either\nYeah I mean when my son was deployed in Iraq some batteries for his high speed flashlight or that he couldn't get in the little PXs over there and you're not supposed to mail batteries to people so I I'll and this\nMaybe I'm going on out here I pack batteries\nInside a bag of them in there so that you know he could get the batteries they needed you know in combat or and you know you can do it but it it takes some imagination in some uh some ability to not tell the truth in that particular moment and that you know whether this this\nYou don't know what's inside one of those Amazon boxes and believe me she has ordered some incredibly heavy stuff from time to time and there's and there's also the F word feels like it's a box full of air so ... you know if you wanted to really conceal it\nYou would have concealed it inside a bubble wrap inside a box you would've taped ... you you might have even ... copied some of the markings of a UPS box or an Amazon Prime box\nBut if you act like if you package you did\nIf you went to all that effort to build these things and then package did in a way that anybody who picks up a manila envelope that feels like it has a pipe in it and his and immediately suspicious I'd be amazed I think they were designed to be based on the way they look they were designed to be on it or\nIf you look at the ability of BSO pay for for terrorism is and the other that's what's in the textbook that all of his what is the end the textbook really missing is is is is is the big cut and paste letters like a ... or ... I'm ... I'm going to get you know I saw them that's missed it from that do you know I it's textbook\nSaw a comment from a from a cop I Know not not long ago where he said he he was involved in in covering kidnappings in ransoms and things like that for Twenty years he never once a note made up of letters words cut out of magazines faces the only place he had ever seen that\nIRS He never once a note made up of letters or words cut out of magazines and he says the only place he had ever seen that was in movies and TV that he'd never actually seen it himself\nSo I kinda wonder we don't want to mix up too much of movies and TV with real life thanks for the call by the way and glad you called in from Alabama to go to Steve in Washington DC welcome to the Lars Larson show\nFact check I saw a call our so I've got two questions about this whole thing\nIs that why didn't the photos that was too that were treated out first thing that really ... really is it just makes ice skate all about that makes it ... it\nIs why they treated our police have those photos that is the first question those photos shouldn't be accessible by the public right now and also if you open up a package and there's a bomb in it\nOr you stick around like take a photo of ... bomber you gonna sail\nI'd I'd be walk I'd be stepping away it's the same things that always amazes me when people say I came home and found the front door my house unlocked and I knew were allotted or broken into and I decided to go in and see what was going on look I'm no coward but I think it would and we wouldn't be sensible to do that\nIf you find your house broken into you step back walk away and called the police and if you find a bomb in your office\nYou step back tell everybody else to leave\nAnd you call the police and you get out of the way and you probably don't fire up your cell phone near the possible bomb you know you you leave and and you're right that it does seem odd that what amounts to evidence would be so quickly disseminated to the public\nUnless of course I mean and ... the same thing that struck me that when Cuomo the governor of New York decided about two or three hours ago to to go out and deploy a hundred National Guard to the streets of New York the part of that that doesn't make sense to me is\nYou're talking about packages arriving in the mail what is a National Guard soldier in uniform a standing at the end of an intersection and he said he's deployed them to positions of infrastructure\nIt's almost like you know the joke that Hillary Clinton said that her private email server stored in the basement or in the shed bill bill's love Shaq and ... was safe\nBecause there was a secret service or the secret service was guarding the property and I thought\nSecret Service does not stop electrons from flowing down a wire or over Internet to get to your your ... or email server\nUh and nor does a a soldier or a police officer standing at an intersection stop somebody from delivering a pipe bomb if it's this guy's a looked like male or a delivery thanks for the call by the way\nYou know your data is everywhere speaking of data data breaches\nFacebook breaches big companies that mine

pleasure to be with you and since Brian is not there I'm going to go to and they said we always putting ... to the head of the line Paul is on the line in Pennsylvania pay Paul welcome to the program what's on your mind tonight ...\nThank you for being as responsible and not as derogatory as some other people are so I think you'd do a really good job and your logic is a fantastic thank you and so there's all that good stuff and I mean it\nYou're a pleasure to listen to I don't always agree with you know my point is simply this and I could give you ... and I hope I have a chance to do that\nThere are quite a few on the extreme right for an example it back in two thousand and one of the recount was being done in Florida\nI had a customer my store that said oh all those Democrats they keep raking and and you know ... that that stuff and I said yeah I watch television last night and the door to the county room was bashed in and came people that were screaming yelling and waving their arms and anger\nAnd stop the boat stop the vote and I said oh they were Republicans weren't day and he said eh my point was not that the left us better or the right is better the extremists that woman that held up the the fake separate head of the president I miss disgusted about her\nAs probably any conservative would be and I'm disgusted about the neo Nazis and Virginia that that\nYou know did the the uh the the ranting and raving and there were the the ... for a man drove from California to incite rioting and a woman that was peaceably walking along\nYou're ... you're trying to run out the clock on me I think now so and unfortunately\nIf if you if you want to go back twenty or Thirty years we could actually go back a hundred and fifty years and say how most of the assassinations and attempted assassination spend the work of liberals and the answer would be yes and I could give you chapter and verse on that if you want to go more recently what we could say is well let's see\n[noise] has Hillary Clinton said you will not get a return to civility until you give us power back\nHas antifa marched in the streets and they benefit the left have we seen blind lives matter commit acts\nOf violence ... trying to burn whole towns down guns have been fired people have been heard uh and that is the lens and then you've got to occupy and they have been you know both gross and disgusting and violent as well over the years all of those things are coming from the left\nAnd all I Would like it and you know Steve ... very nearly died because of a left wing Bernie Sanders supporter or who was a lefty who was angry and decided to shoot a bunch of Republicans\nAnd you've seen like Eric Holder encourage violence Maxine Waters encourage violence Hillary as I said he encouraged violence so ... you know when you tell me oh there's a little bit on both sides I hear that kind of moral equivalency from reporters who don't have the guts to say\nOne side has identified itself with violence\nThere's a little bit on both sides I hear that kind of moral equivalency from reporters who don't have the guts to say one side has identified itself with violent protest far more than the other side\nMost ... in fact when Republicans call me or conservatives called me and they say\nHey let's go out and have a protest and lunch yell and scream and you know carry signs and and and all that I say that's that's not the way conservatives act\nWe are conservative whereas the ... the left does to they'll go out and you know remember the day after the inauguration the big women's march where vehicles are set on fire people whereas assaulted bad things happen to have you ever seen conservatives in America do that\nNow I'm not going to say there aren't individual conservatives who will throw a party or maybe try and push down our door but I'm saying for the most part the big protest some conservatives like Tea Party protests\nAre peaceful there well ordered and they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived whereas when the left shows up you can usually count on broken windows people assaulted\nAnd you saw all the assaults on Donald Trump supporters through the entire campaign when people would show up in an event that was not their event they would they were there not to listen and maybe pick apart what the candidate was saying I think that's legitimate I go to liberal or you know speeches on occasion so that I can hear what they're saying\nBut I don't see the kind of behavior by conservatives that I see that comes from the left\nDo you see any examples of that like what does it what did the president who am I ... and ... he said several things during the campaign police don't be so so kind to the president's ... their heads and you put them in a said\nOil ... exactly but Paul at some point words are turned into actions or they're not you you and and I know that that's true on both sides there are people who say that guy makes me so mad I Want to kill him have you ever heard of a friend of yours say that\nYes and have they ever killed anyone your friends you know\nSo there are so here's the difference there is a a wide difference usually between what people say\nAnd what people actually do but when people actually do those things when they show up at political rallies and said this isn't even my rally it's not my candidate I'm going to show up and I'm gonna disrupted so that nobody can speak and by the way\nWhen you see hearings on Capitol Hill and the left doesn't like what's going on in the hearing they show up and tried to disrupt the event you see conservatives doing that\n[noise] um I I think if you if you're willing to do it get the Southern Poverty\nLaw that that ... that bungee is morally bankrupt and they don't tell the truth they might have been one up what evidence do you have that\nBecause I've seen and I know some of the groups I've covered some of the groups that they have labeled as hate groups they've labeled as hate groups any group that doesn't agree with them politically which is very it's\nIt's a kind of political bigotry it's the kind of thing that if you're at work and there's a guy at work you don't like and he said he has the best idea you've ever heard it or your bond as ever hurting his life and you say that guy's fat\nOr that guy staying where he doesn't take a shower or you know or you know his ... you know he smells like arm pet all the ... you say well what about his idea oh it doesn't matter he's fat\n... it's the political bigotry where you say none of those the ideas coming from that person or any good I'm telling you that when I've seen hearings on Capitol Hill I have yet to see\nYou say none of those the ideas coming from that person or any good I'm telling you that when I've seen hearings on Capitol Hill I have yet to see one where conservative show up and they say oh we don't we don't like the content of this hearing so we're going to disrupt it that is almost exclusively an activity of the left\nAnd the protests the mass protests from the women's march to the Occupy to black lives matter to antifa are all from the left there usually all potentially violent some ... some cases actually violent people get hurt you get burned down things get broken\nYou can't just do conservative incidence of the same ...\nCan you well it the neo Nazis identify with the light and the skin\nNeal listen you gotta remember you don't want to not see is that the national socialist party it was invented by Adolf Hitler you know and it happened it was a socialist\nAt all yeah yes it was if you took a look at Germany's economy it was very much socialist they said the state controls everything and you will produce for the state and you will be subsumed by the state if the state tells you when you're ... if it is socialism is\nThe ownership and I say this socialism is the ownership of the means of production\nThat's out of a of a college textbook real socialism can only be done to the point of a gun if you go to somebody and say hey by the way you made a lot of money this month but this guy over here didn't make much\nYou know Americans said every American citizen depending and don't you know regardless of their income for help you know for health expenditures for you know major health problems that they might have I think most Americans believe that\nBut and and most American say well you have a system to provide the benefits to them but Americans don't want to give up their own health insurance you know Ninety percent of us health insurance we all want to you know will and Arnold plant\nYou know so that that that ... percent or don't have healthcare that it just came to the healthcare voucher and let him go out and shop for health care you know that's the way I feel that the interests of you know you mentioned the veterans plant you I experienced the same thing some of the veterans say to me\nYou know I get good health coverage from the vet DAS but all we have lots of read right down the street from where I live that's one of the finest hospitals in the world\nBut other veterans say I I you know get lousy care so why not give every veteran a an opportunity if they don't want to go to the VA hospital they vote another hospital well I'm a choice guy but the Democrats don't believe in choice they believe that forcing you into the health care that they want to give you\nYou know what I'd like to do I want to make a proposal I Want to I Want the government is far out of health care as we can possibly do while still living now here's what I Do in place\nSteve to pieces first of all let's deal with the pre existing condition crowd which is about somewhere between two hundred thousand and maybe a high end of four hundred thousand people because we know those numbers because of the people who signed up for Obamacare with preexisting conditions when they wiped out all the risk bowls\nSo those two hundred thousand people could be covered as I understand the numbers for maybe ten Fifteen billion dollars out of ... or ... thousand\nBillion dollar federal budget like saying four thousand billion while they were saying if you made four thousand bucks a month could you afford Fifteen bucks for this black people would say or for the you know forty thousand bucks a year could you afford a hundred and fifty dollars for this just to make the math easy\nThen I go sure so that's part one just cover everybody with a preexisting condition that who has ... let's say wealth blow up a million bucks or half a million bucks and ... below ... a hundred thousand dollars yeah if you're over a hundred thousand you got to take care of yourself second\nWhat I'd like to do is have the government say we will ... define what a good catastrophic plan is because this is the second group is all of us who realize I get hit by a truck\nAnd or you know I get hit by heart attack and I need a hundred and fifty thousand dollar operation if I don't have health care and I do um then I Need to have that bypass covered or the transplant coming or whatever your kid needs a new kidney okay we'll take care of it\nBut we'll take care of it by saying we will offer a catastrophic plan for those people who want to go up ... actively bear they're not going to have any insurance except catastrophic\nAnd they say it's like you know the having having a a collusion\nInsurance on her own home owner's insurance homeowner's insurance in case you're out and burns down I don't want to see\nEven on homeowners I bumped my deductible from a thousand five thousand because they said why my wife said well why ... ... well for house burned down then we have to cover the first five thousand not not a big deal if your house burned down you know five thousand bucks but the the chance of that is very low and the ...\nWe have to cover the first five thousand not not a big deal if your house burned down you know five thousand bucks\nBut the the chance of that is very low and the savings by going to that it gives you a really low premium so\nYou do those two things but you don't have the government provided you say to the insurance industry develop this product and if you meet the criteria so we can tell people it has the good housekeeping into Donald Trump seal of approval on and then\nPick from one of the news and the and all of these companies will compete with each other saying we have a better one and it's only forty dollars a month\nAnd literally could get to premiums like that couldn't wait\nYeah I mean think about it this way but at least you know McDonalds is the best restaurants\nIn the you know fast food restaurant so we don't need all these other\nFast food restaurants or you don't need those or can we do what I advise everybody can just go to McDonalds well first of all what do you think would happen to the quality of food at all that they should have the right orbit attached to a lot chick on healthcare it should definitely\nYou know the Medicare I don't have to remind you this but some of your listeners may need to be reminded Medicare is now facing something like\nThirty trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities so we're really going up every ... which is like putting every American land of the ... right I mean you know it's already gone bankrupt among other hundred

economic freedom and it's good to have you back on the program John thanks for the time to not\nHave ours it's great to be here thanks for having me out\nI'm Glad to do it I I Know that there are some people out there who think that innovation comes about because of government edict clearly President Obama popped I could just declare that cars will get fifty miles to the gallon and order the scientists to come up with something like a Darth Vader saying\nYou will develop this you will I mean if they'd been around when at us and it was around he wouldn't have had to go through ten thousand different filament to figure out what would a light bulb go he just needed a president or a or an emperor or someone just to order him to do it\nBut actually it come about because of freedom doesn't sorry drug is it [laughter]\nI Love what you say is not true if it\nTo the Democrats um that they still believe in all this fantasy that the Internet exist because the government event that in fact the government misused massive amounts of resources to create something that was totally out of work for the private sector only for private actors\nTo to actually make it work on the private sector and it just raises the question is government weren't spending billions and hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars a year for all this time I imagine how much quicker we would have gotten to the Internet to no government can never innovate and one reason that cat is because failure does not\nForm what it does to your point about Edison Edison had to fail thousands of times to get to the light bulb government can't do that\nWell and in those cases are away for America to get back to the kind of freedom there was always made I I'd say always maybe I'm being brought their has for a long time made America a center of innovation not just technologically\nBut I think I even in terms of the way we live our lives with the freedoms we enjoy were were an innovative country compared to the rest of the world\nOh we we are in a more innovative let's stress that were innovative because we're free\nUm think about it if if Steve Jobs his father had left Syria does anyone say that apple would would now be the most valuable company in the world only that it'd be Ed Ed headquartered in Damascus and the reality is that the U.S is where counted\nPeople are able to achieve great things because they're free the mistake and this has made I think by people on both sides they say the U.S has an innovation and innovative adds a technological edge them in the U.S has no such thing\nFree individuals in the United states\nHave a tendency to be very innovative but this is not an American thing this individual things that don't think the government can can can foster more this this is about freeing individuals to be great\nWell and that's what I'm Talking about I'm I'm saying if there was a way I've always thought the government should be like so I don't I don't ride horses a lot but I like riding horses when I can\nAnd I've always thought somebody was really good at it could sit on a horse hold the reins in his hand and not poll a whole lot if you're the kind of guy or gal who has to take those range and yank them around to get the horse to do what you wanted to do then you're pretty bad at it if you're really good at it\nYou just kind of give a little direction here and there and you're mostly stay out of the way you know laissez faire approach to this\nOf course the just the people left alone\nLeft to their own devices allowed to prosper have a tendency to prosper and and and what's important here is is that we want this to happen in global it why is the U.S so great\nInterest as an innovative power yes our people are free but think about what our innovations have meant for the rest of the world that was the world impoverished by the fact that Microsoft was headquartered in Seattle that Amazon\nAbout what our innovations have meant for the rest of the world was the world impoverished by the fact that Microsoft was headquartered in Seattle that Amazon's Seattle that Apple's based in Cupertino, California can I throw in Nike is based in Portland, Oregon none in the world has been made better off by genius\nAnd say you look at this in a broad sense the beauty of happy having markets open\nIs that it means that the innovation it's as though it happened right next door\nEven though I've never lived in Portland I wearing Nike shoes all the time and I'm Better for it even though I've never lived in Cupertino I and and and the much better more productive person thanks to apple and so what we want is not American innovation we want global innovation we want\nSteve Jobs around the world of each even great things but they are much better our living standards will be a talented people from around the world are free to be great\nIn fact I've never seen Nike written up this way maybe somebody has but I'm not aware of it but they're right in my backyard and I I have great admiration for the company although I think their choice with Colin Kaepernick is rather sad but as a spokesman but\nHave you noticed a you'll correct me on this but I think they first made their first shoes in Japan\nAnd then they moved out of there and I believe they went to Taiwan and then they went to China and I think they went from China to Vietnam they might have had to stop in Korea South Korea at some point but what happened was every time they went into a place for\nA while Americans can sneer at making five dollars a day sewing soccer balls or whatever it is\nThey have to accept that all the third world countries that were I was born a third world country I was born in Taiwan and it was definitely a third world country when I was born there and fifty nine today\nIt's one of the biggest producers electronics on the planet I think it's half the laptops or Ninety percent of the desk tops were made that in that one tiny little country why well there was a time when sewing shoes are blooming shoes was was a good job and and as as their economy rose because of that activity\nThey said oh we don't need to make shoes anymore and Nike said and we don't need to pay these prices anymore they moved on but it was almost like Nike has it moved from place to place was like an economic lawnmower you know you what's your left behind was ... you know a society that had\nThe opportunity to make laptop computers that they might never have had\nIf they hadn't had a couple of decades American tennis shoes\nOh absolutely I mean he he put it very well yes Nike started the first place country which their shoes are manufactured what was the fact Japan Japan was destroyed by World War two and said they started making shoes\nFor people like Nike and then as you say they move to different countries but I Love the story about Vietnam simply because the people who worked in their factories these alleged sweat sweat shops first began by walking to work then they bike to work then they wrote scooters to work\nBy the end they're driving cars to work I think about it and you look at China Today is as you well know Latin been born in Taiwan, China was once it\nDesperately poor country a Nike that is I think according to shoot dog which I Know you've read Phil Knight said that that's where they manufacture more peril and issues than anywhere in the world\nI think about what are the transformative impact Nike is hat and so I'm merely said okay we've got all these innovators and the United states who have debt or the world\nI Want innovators from around the world to do great things because the better the United states per se it doesn't matter where some things made if our markets are open will benefit as those may next door I wear Nikes all the time is not never let the court\nJohn it's a pleasure to have you on and thanks for the work to do it freedomworks\nThanks for having me\nNike's all the time is not never let them or\nJohn it's a pleasure to have you on and thanks for the work to do it freedomworks\nThanks for having me\n... glad to have you on that John Tammany with us by the way I Want to tell you about a product that I fell in love with more than Twenty years ago in fact in about a week teen and I'm Mark one full Twenty years\nOf sleeping on sleep number bed every night how does a great night sleep improve your performance\nHow about more energy less brain far better mood and more productivity I can speak to that personally the news sleep number three sixty smart bed I sleep on one and so this is Tina\nHelps everyone from parents to pro athletes to talk show host improve their daily performance through great quality sleep my sleep number setting is sixty five Fifteen is is a forty five\nBut that's the beauty of the bed it adjusts on both sides\nTaylor believes is a gun it is still armed robbery under the law whether you had a gun or not so it's just as I say just I'm not trying to minimize it but if it's attention seeking behavior are we likely to see more of this kind of thing because\nYou know this is this does terrorize people\nYeah I I think we might see more and then you might see also the dreaded copy cats and ... who lost all that when they eat or who is the FBI the secret service will um ... all ...\nStates future behavior you know that you go over that says I'm going to say well I'm not surprised or they're going to have a history of either\nMental illness are committing thoughts the Colts regardless of their means mode of opportunity and um you know those little eat this will be talked about stuff on they either do something like this before or sit there where you know I always go back to the bottom\nOf the way the Unabomber he ran for years nobody can figure out how he was with credit they put it in his manifesto and as soon as his brother read it they knew what he knew exactly what was it was just brought it\nYeah because he recognize a lot of the uh what did you go right at that line of crazy that that that's my brother he talks like that he writes like that right and and he was he did a tremendous service and I guess I Wonder I Wonder did the time out loud\nWould you have the courage to say my brother is doing something really terrible that's taking people's lives\nI'm going to turn him in and I know the results of my turning him is going to send them to prison I I don't have any doubt in my mind I Would do that if a family member was doing such as that but I Wonder if there are other people who would say no I just don't want to know about it and I I I don't want to be responsible for sending my my brother to prison for the rest of his life\nYeah when you look at the circumstances don't forget how many people were named and injured\nOn ... ... when they realize too was that was on his brother's mind his brother talked about that that that you know he felt so guilty but it took so long to figure out who it was but as soon as he saw the manifesto he took tournament\nWell and here's here's the other question I Know that let's say we find out I I put up a few possibilities on our Twitter pulled tonight is at the left is it the ride is it because of the election is it a garden variety nut case or is it a foreign factor it is beginning to sound like a garden variety nut cases based on the way they are because\nGary for what little we know about it right I'm Talking to Gary Byrne who's the author of secrets of the secret service in crisis of character 'em\nUp a piece of pie in manila envelope that doesn't even you know conceal it weighed or its size or in shape\nSeems almost designed to be identified easily and now that we're finding out the or the CNN device was not even a real explosive device although some of these were they at least had the components to go off but none of them did go off\nSo does right if if this was a garden variety nut case he said I'm going to make something that looks enough like a bomb it'll scare people half to death but I don't want it to go off I don't want it to maim or kill people and I want it to be fairly quickly and readily identified\nAnd the amount of tape you used on those bombs in the packages I'm willing to bet the FBI is going to find fingerprints DNA and all kinds of things is this somebody who's saying I Want to be caught and I want to be identified\nYeah the the and also something else or you just pointed out um you let it ... it is that that's a that's a sign of a mental condition um that that is as an issue and it's almost like being compulsive where they put so much tape on it that's that's not a ...\nInitially um ... the ... issue it's almost like being compulsive where they put so much tape on it that's that's not a real bomb builder that somebody who's got a lot of this and uh for one reason or the other they're angry there detach and again when they figure out who this is\nYou know there's certain things are going to be there and and there'd be filthy somebody goes forward and says you know there's a thing or they'll have a record\nOr you know they'll have a record or history of anti government anti certain you know certain party a politician and um so yes but all of that tape that's um that's a bomb building that's like craziness\nYeah and and I know people are going to say well those shows we need more mental health care we have hundreds of millions of dollars of mental health care the problem is you can't force it on people\nAnd so if the person won't ... I I really think we need to revisit the civil commitment laws\nBecause you know that I hear from families all the time who say we got a family member we know one of these days he's going to end up in one of these news stories but the cops tell us we can do nothing the lawyers tells we can do not think\nIf we don't ... revisited the civil commitment laws I think it's not only unsafe for the general public but it's also unfair to the person who's mentally ill and we all say well we have to wait until you actually kill somebody or hurt yourself before we can do anything meaningful about Garry I appreciate the time and sorry about the technical fu bar\nNo problem I'm grateful to be on again look forward to the next to\nThe book is called the secrets of the secret service and coming up should there be restrictions on the border patrol at a bus stations [noise] I'll talk to the mayor of the city where they just passed an ordinance and he says\nNo we shouldn't cooperate with the border patrol you're listening to Lars Larson show [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] you'll see one our earnings go up we earn more\nYou know if you've done clots um squeaking white board marker [noise]\nEasily one of the most annoying office noises there is right up there with the woman who taps or Penn like she's doing a drum solo at a sold out arena [noise]\nAnd monster we can't stop those types of noises but we can quiet all the noise around finding the right talent you know to know what you were talking about\nAll you're trying to do is fill rules for your company but instead you're being inundated with reps from job sites trying to see one size fits all products you don't need and your inbox is full of candidates you'd never even consider monster cuts through that noise we work with you to really understand your needs and address those needs with the right solution\nNo more no less just smart people getting to know your business with simple personalized solutions for a fair price real human being human how's that sound\nWell probably like the opposite of the smoker [laughter]\nCall eighty eight months to to talk to someone without Louis today\nWhen the need for senior care Iraq is there's no place like home\nYour loved one should never had to give up living at home visiting and tell us will provide home care for your mom and dad at home I'm twenty four hours per day including personal care meal and light housework you'll selective professional caregiver with visiting angel visiting ... dot com or calling eight seven seven three seven four in ...\nAnd eight seven seven three seven four men franchise is there an animal visiting in jail America's Choice in senior home care\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight that eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the first steps to recovery to help you need to be one call the way\nUnder three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the\nFirst steps to recovery to help you need to be one Callaway eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the recall now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight your addiction teams that third party advertiser for various treatment centers in place from networks individual results will dairy visit your edition team dot com forward slash Kearns for more information\nOne of our one cake UGA just two sons mid term election destination station and we want you to know about proposition is coming up on the November ballot\nProposition for sixty three us position that's Pima County solution to road condition was the county would split four hundred thirty million dollars in a fair and equitable way amongst the area's jurisdictions moron proposition for sixty three add another good one oh four one K. cutie H. dot com combat bottom of the hour\nSaid connected uninformed anytime at one of four one K. cute ph dot com\nYou they Wildcats welcome the Oregon Ducks to Arizona Stadium this weekend listen to the Joe ... show four to seven for your chance to win a for Baca tickets to the game\nThis month give local Tucson partner is handy dogs dedicated to helping older adults people with disabilities improve their quality of life through the specialized training dogs they're looking for volunteer foster homes breeders and donations more details at one of our\nOne ...\nJoins us on MORNING news at six and seven AM for the first Fifteen everything you need to know about what's going on in this great big world of our state of Arizona and the ...\nSmart listeners loves smart speakers we made a civil listen to one of four one K.
