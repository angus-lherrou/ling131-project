push a button to make something work and it doesn't we fix that\nThat's who I think made a colossal mistake\nBecause she decided to have her DNA tested and then she saw the results\nAnd she saw that she was as little as one one thousand Native American which is actually lower than the average person who lives on the north American continent and then she and her staff I assume she consulted with her staff\nSaid let's give this to the Boston Globe and let them put it on the front page and that will convince everybody that I Am in fact the Native American I claimed so I could get that sweet job at Harvard\nA L brought a joins me now who's managing editor of the stream el welcome back to the program and do do you think that Elizabeth Warren made a big mistake and there's a big enough to take her out of the presidential sweepstakes\nWell compared to Custer felt that he made a mistake but uh [laughter]\nIt what it did is it definitely lowered or stock I mean if I'm putting money on two thousand two thousand twenty democratic race she just she just got a ... she blew it in a way 'cause\nShe it it it's not so much that you know it's what how she did it it's one thing to take the test I'm Glad you took the test that's cool\nAnd I'm Glad she's proud that there's some that blood in there but to to try to use it as a slam dunk against Trump ... was it was stupid and she looked silly and when you look silly once that gets into the cultural life\nYou're in trouble like Cory Cory bookers Spartacus that you're in trouble you\nKnow you're you're already you're going to take down Trump with that kind of thing I mean come on ... thing really\nDid she really really did some damage to herself with this and it was self inflicted too and and that she could have done released the details in a way to put you put a lady issue and she didn't do it in person was smart enough to do that as a smart enough to be president\nWell the other thing is is out at some level I think she knows that she's not Native American and I think she's known since twenty twelve when it was question then she came up with inadequate a proof of it\nAnd I think this would have been an opportunity I could even see uh if if she had a staff willing to stand up for themselves and say to the Boston I Know it's tough says Abbas boss you're wrong here's what you should do you should go out and said this has been an issue since twenty twelve who was brought up in that election campaign\nAnd I've now done a test and I found out that I'm only at most three percent Native American so you know what I was wrong and if she had done that\nAnd and used it as soon as she still would have been able to say to the public I'm I'm maybe as much as three percent Native American but I was wrong to claim not a Native American status I didn't do it for any bad reason I think she did do it for a bad reason to advance or sell financially and professionally but she can do that\nAnd I think America what is it oh okay and then it would have disappeared as an issue\nWell here you go and she had the ... and she has the perfect um hook is he the ancestry dot ... dot com commercial where some guy say for all my life we thought we were German we went to the you know October fest we dressed up and then we found out what Seventy percent\nIrish there's whatever was I've seen a commercial out\nThere that that deals with this she does is booth that commercial for what I mean that's the way out there a little bit but still the I\n... well no you're on the right track ... you're on the right track ... imagine if she'd said hey you know that ancestry commercial is the guy who thought he was Irish and they found is these are tallying instead well guess what I found out I'm In the same boat and I think people would have laughed they would have said well OK and we'll let bygones be bygones I've seen politicians do it\nBut so few of the I Want your view on this so few politicians seem capable of saying and you know what I was wrong about that but I Apologize and a no hard\nView on this so few politicians seem capable of saying you know what I was wrong about that but I Apologize and are no hard feelings right and and then by twenty twenty if anybody like me tried to bring this thing back up again they'd say she dealt with that she said she was wrong why don't you let that one go\nYeah I heard you're exactly right hurt for tax would have been to like under play under play what ... under play the relationship and they said ... admits she made them in ... she made a mistake people live on it because and again like you said if he made a little bit of light of it and\n[noise] she she wouldn't look foolish there wouldn't be the names out there that are gonna be just as devastating as Dukakis on that tank you know\nOh my God you all boy and when you say that the picture comes back to mind but the other thing or two years later thirty or is he still knows he looks like a few who and Everytime I go to an email from Howard Dean and I'm Still getting ... emails not personally been you know the solicitations I think about that scream\nIt or whatever it was he said that night that in one moment one big scream ended his entire and he was the hot prospects but here's the other thing that bugs me about it now you tell me what you think\nWe hire presidents and senators and governors to make great decisions\nAnd we expect them to to be done in a way that serves all of us and sometimes they involve the life and death sending people to war spending huge amounts of money sinking the country into debt or getting us out\nSo when we hire people to make really great decisions and then we see someone like Elizabeth Warren make a colossal eat bad this she's had six years to think about it she gets the new data in and rather than saying\nYou know I probably have to admit I was just wrong and that this is my excuse to do it she makes a colossally bad mistake and then says by the way would you like me making mistakes from the most powerful office in the world\nYeah what what's interesting is as you're talking I'm remembering what I guess is chief of staff Kelly said about a couple of weeks ago how he she was arrogant and of course she took that as well be strong to the president blah blah blah\nIt does it does and that's a general generals used to that you know tough people you know it's a color arrogant\nAnd say that that's the key to this this thing it's the arrogance of thinking well I've got the the media behind me I'm going to do this and I'm going to jump on Trump that's I think some of the key to key why she thought this would be a good idea and in doing it again it the way she did\nThere's all there's also I think the comedy isn't or ... you can't give yourself a nickname so if you have Cory Booker wanted to be smarter because he needed to arrange for somebody else to call them Spartacus when you call yourself Spartacus doesn't go I work as well\nYeah yeah and that's and that's the thing and they're all all these people are trying\nAll these Democrats who are thinking about two dozen twenty are all trying to nudge the way to the front of the pack in her case I think he's trying to be the foil to Trump see I got him I got well you don't like the ball when you're up you're losing sixty four to nothing\nYou know one sixty fourth Indian is like being down sixty four to nothing spiking the ball you look stupid you know but ... but that study that twenty twenty or so focused on that you're not taking care of business and doing what you need to do to win\nSo tell me this goes back to the presidency\nNow do you think this takes her out of it or does she find a way to stay in it because I mean that would be God's Gift to talk radio I'll admit but not not great for the country or those clear the path for for Joe Biden would say\nIt it makes things easier for the people who are running against or but again with the ... uh news cycle that's so fast\nFor for Joe Biden let's say\nIt it makes things easier for the people who are running against or but again with the ... news cycle that so fast me Kanye West of the White House already seems like years ago\nAnd there you go you know so it made you know again but it weakens her and again she's going to be fighting some people\nWho who who want really want the job too and they're not going to play nice so\nShe can maybe you maybe you can but again once you're once you're in that once you're in that place where you're seeing\nIs not serious which is what one thing she had going for is that she was seen as a serious thinker and now you look silly you've taken away you know some of your say mo Jo some of the thing that made you Elizabeth Warren and that's hard to hard to recover from\nYou know I'll I got a rap during the second but I had one other thought you know who I feel sorry for them this\nIs Democrats who are also Native Americans real Native Americans because it puts them in an incredibly awkward spot do I stay loyal to Mike my a party and because I Believe in the Democratic party I Know there are people who do\nAnd do I didn't support Elizabeth Warren or do I turn around and say I don't care she's not a real Native American she's not one of us as the Cherokee Nation said\nThe the writer continues to call her Pocahontas that continues to\nMake a very big deal about this I just I in my mind keeps going that birth or um [noise] uh\nThe birther thing well you know we still haven't set a precedent\nThat really the poor get that for years and never apologized ADS Obama looked for us but that was an awful\nJoint and in order to do you know that some of us still have serious questions about President Obama's um background we still don't know much about what he took her how he got into his underground\nHis graduate school or into Harvard there are many people who went to Harvard the same time he did including friends of mine when Elon routes one of them\nWho says I was there on campus I never saw the guy so and we don't know anything about and we knew when Gore ran against Bush\nOr for the presidency we knew would Gore's grades where we knew what he took we knew what Bush's grades where we knew Bush got a better grade in science and Al Gore did we didn't we don't know anything about him he was the editor of the Harvard law review but he never wrote in the articles\nFor the Harvard law review so there are lots of questions about President Obama's background but you're right does pass you know who brought this ... this week Elizabeth Warren did she decided\nThat the second second point I had her up during the day go ahead I also listen to the dentist hiker show and this is great do you get a like well it was dinner and Sebastian Gorka and ... and they were made up well they were talking about the compassionate\nThat Donald Trump which I don't see it all but and then they were talking also about his um what they say is taking the fact that I get very much a mop the doctor for that\nI'm at on his feet and they were saying that um that Donald\nTrump himself credit clarified that with the energy on sixty minutes that he um did it\nUm that she that Kevin I wouldn't have made it to if it had not been for you know what he was sane at the rally about publicity if our president actually two middle aged woman who said that the one of the main thing she re limburg was laughing at\nHer and if she didn't is Prager and Sebastian\nGlass it could've been laugh after caused the rally at learn to laugh and millions of people who might be one rally to laugh at Dr Ford\nSo that he could get ... through ... and I say I don't see that that will listen to me as best\nYou can join me like ... or take a break and just let me ask you a couple of questions do you agree that the accusation that Dr Ford made was very thinly evidence she couldn't remember most of the details that would be\nThe details necessary to prove something happened and when she named witnesses none of the witnesses including her best friend could remember that in every been happening for best friends so she never even met bread costs\nIf something happened and when she named witnesses none of the witnesses including her best friend could remember that it ever even happened in ... for best friends so she never even met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet yet Dr Ford a professor Ford said that her best friend was there when this awful thing was supposed to happen the reason there is so much anger at a Christine Blasey Ford ... Ford\nIs that she made a career and frankly person destroying accusation\nAnd did it with nothing that she did it with nothing to back it up\nBut I\nDon't hold hold on joy joy I've got to push back at that her life is destroyed can I tell you what's already happened and what is likely to happen Dr ... a professor Ford has received over a million dollars from or go fund me account\nShe will get a book offering if she wants to take it she'll make more money for having somebody goes write a book for her she will be invited to speak before groups and be paid large sums of money five figures sums of money to speak justice Anita Hill has for the last twenty five years\nAnita Hill but she didn't know if that's what she wants but all I'm saying is all of that is available would you say her life is destroyed she got to tell her story she very nearly took down the Supreme Court justice she now has over a million bucks book offers and speaking offers if she wants them down to life destroyed\nI Know people who work with her I work at Stanford for years um in fact one of my friends than it was added a candlelight it\nOr I'm going up on a ... to get to your point\nAnd and the Republican women was leaning by saying at my but what I'm saying that\nHe and I I remember so boy laughing at signed up you know I remember\nThat you know and I can walk by a teenage boy then maybe at that point you don't come out with a bad accusation with\nNo evidence to try to destroy some I appreciate the call joy you're listening Lars Larson show\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWe're heading into the final chapter of the great American read on PBS PBS asked you to pick your number one book from a list of America hundreds lobby novel on Tuesday I cover twenty thirty eight seven the central hosts merit is the era and some very\nSpecial Gasper count down the top novel based on your vote and then if the big reveal America's favorite don't meet the grand finale of the great American read his abdomen twenty thirty eight seven Santo only on your PBS station\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying\nFrom coffee tea or smoking power swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shades even better there is no messy strips are trace that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and power swabs call one eight hundred six seven eight\nNine ... nine six night your bright white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look\nTry at risk free one eight hundred six seven\nNine o nine six night that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you read the book and want to get it published he's publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nPrinting governor art publicity copyright an editing ... eight hundred fines or one thirty six eighty nine now where you're free author submission get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free\nRight and editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now where you're free author ... should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred by zero one thirty six eighty nine\nWhen the need for senior characterizes there's no place like home\nYour loved one should never had to give up living at home visiting angel as will provide home care for your mom or dad at home I'm twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and light housework you'll selective professional caregiver with visiting angel look up at ... dot com or called eight seven seven three seven for less\nThan eight seven seven three seven four men franchises are available visiting and Jill America's Choice and senior home\nCare\nAt the top and bottom of the hour they connected uninformed anytime at one of four one K. cutie H. dot com listen\nTo the Dave Ramsey show Lebanon one for your chance to win a pair of tickets to the money in marriage advantage Phoenix November age has a bone to see a win one hundred dollars to more information of where one kick Eugene ...\nYou can help one oh four one K. cue G H in the fight against breast cancer be a real man by wearing tank during the making strides against\nBreast cancer walk this Sunday at armory part registration starts seven AM the walk starts at eight if he can't walk donate details of one oh four one K. cutie H. dot com this month's to give the local Tucson partner is handy dogs dedicated\nTo helping older adults that people with disabilities and improve the quality of life through the specialized training dogs they're lucky for volunteer foster homes breeders and donations for details at one of four one K.

news and cock your mid term elections ... coverage online anytime at one of four one K. cutie H. dot com [noise]\nAnd you know alert honestly for evocative talk on the floors wash them shows that's right it is you want to join the conversation at talk journalism\nAnd ... that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com you know I remember it wasn't that many years ago\nThat a president named Obama was telling Americans word peak oil we're going to be running out of oil so we have to get away from oil just as fast as we possibly can\nAnd then of course we've seen the energy revolution over about the last decade or so in which America is gone from a big importer and heavily dependent on foreign sources of oil to not only self sufficient but literally enough energy in oil and natural gas that we can literally export a lot of it and we have abundance supply\nAnd we don't have to be beholden to foreign shakes or Venezuela or nasty people like that so what we still have politicians who are trying to push us out from away away from oil um bill de Blasio mayor of New York is calling on cities to you\nHanding off enormous law says that they would otherwise not have a in those pension funds and a ... to the tune for example in New York state of a one point two to one point five trillion dollars over fifty years that has to be made up by somebody\nAh in order to pay people's pensions and you know that's going to be ultimately the taxpayers\nWell and and so if I understand correctly he would like all the big cities who have massive pension funds that have to earn money until the people who are going to get the pensions get paid\nAnd that when if they were to back out of oil stocks I assume they'd put the money into some other kind of dogs and the oil stocks it'd be sold to willing buyers would happily buy them so it won't make any difference to the oil companies\nWill still have plenty of people who combined them but New York will have given a given up on the returns they would have had from the ... you know ... the business of fossil fuels which is still a business that a very much supplies the energy for America so what's what's his thinking I mean do you have any idea what why he wants to do this\nWell it's all part of trying to show that you're virtuous and care about climate change Lars this is all about climate change a as all energy issues tend to be now um and what they're what they're trying to say is that by taking the money out of\nA those returns are those bills they'll simply be taking money away from these companies and they won't have the money and therefore they won't drill wells or something um you know that to me nonsense because the fact of the matter is\nWhen you compare portfolios with energy stocks of all kinds in them versus ones without a the energy\nOr funds perform better and have perform better uh over fifty years so [noise] ... basically what you're [laughter] you're cutting off your nose to spite your face ill in some respects\nI mean aren't because the only way for a city to pull money out we talk about it like it's pulling out a drawer but the only way to pull out of a stock is to sell it to somebody else so you'll have willing buyers who will buy those stocks\nWill win the willing buyers bind them the oil company is an out anything they still have investors who own their stocks in fact I guess they could if the city of New York one step a fire sale and sell their their all their socks and if they announced they're going to do this I assume some of the buyers you're going to say great they're going to give us as we deal\nThey'll end up they may have the I guess they could even take stock they bought for a given an amount of money and ended up selling it to people for less money than they paid for it that's potentially possible\nBut the ... the stock will still be owned by somebody but as you say their stock portfolio they can't replace that stock with the stock that performs as well as the oil stock does so they'll have to take a loss or their pension fund recipients the police officers and the other civil service workers in New York are they aware of what the city is about to do to them\nWell luckily they have someone in in New York state uh the controller who who is in charge of the sudden he has something called a fiduciary responsibility which uh anyone who manages money\nTends to have and you're supposed to watch out for those interests to make sure that you don't make bad investments that take away from the value of those people who own shares in it and those would be the firemen and policemen and civil servants of all kind\nAnd um and he's objecting strenuously to this for the very reasons you and I are discussing because\nServants of all kind and um and he's objecting strenuously to this for the very reasons you and I are discussing because he knows the\nThe record and can show that and can show an enormous loss to the city and the state because it's just a mayor de Blasio it's also Governor Cuomo well\nCan they even legally divest themselves of the stocks of the controller says no this would cause a loss can he prevent them from doing\nIt varies from state to state and it gets a little dicey because you're dealing with these public funds which don't have the same some of the same requirements are obviously because so many of them are under funded\nLars I mean we hear all the time about the states that have massive pension obligations that can afford them Illinois and New York California um and\nAnd so there's a little more leeway in that situation but the for the person in charge are they still attempt to live up to the fiduciary responsibility so uh it's not as iron clad is if you were dealing with a a U.S chartered bank or something like that\n... well it would be interesting to see what they do because I I I just I I think it's highly irresponsible for them to do this and the other thing is New York city itself can't run without fossil fuels candidate they can't run on diesel gasoline and natural gas\nUh no it would have a very very hard time and the northeast is getting increasingly\nIn bad shape as a consequence of bad decisions that won't allow pipelines rebuilt and that sort of thing so uh we'll see what the winner holds but ah last winter they barely escaped death and uh it's it's probably gotten worse\nAh and if we get a cold winter will will be able to see ... laboratories of democracy Lars\nYou know it'd be interesting uh I I Know it's it's just fantasy but can you imagine if the big oil companies are said to New York city you want to do that fine you want to get out of fossil fuels fine we will stop delivery of fossil fuels to all your filling stations you know we won't cut off the\nYou know the oil heat that some people still depend on but we are going to stop supplying gasoline\nAnd will do it for a week to see how you like being without gasoline and be entirely out of oil can you imagine I mean as much as Manhattan runs on mass transit they also run on ... and cabs and diesel powered buses and the like\nCan you imagine this and Jazz Can you imagine where they'd be fossil fuel a liquid fuel deliveries stopped to say filling stations and the and the local airport\n[noise] ah that would be one of those what did President Obama used to always tell us that it's a a ...\nMoment or [laughter] something like that teachable moment teachable moment\nAnd just say you want to try it well I'll tell you what will just slow it down we'll cut our deliveries to half\nAnd and the New Yorkers who who ... who didn't get a chance to see the gasoline station lines of the early Nineteen seventies could sit in line for an hour or two waiting for gasoline I Know they blame the oil companies\nLike that they'd be working while they're in school\nAgain why you're Twenty one twenty two year work when I was kind of natural April\nWe wouldn't have a well you know that that student debt crisis if these kids work while they were in school to pay for their education now is that so unreasonable\nNo and and specially Steve I remembered not only I worked all the way through the beer an average in school but I did and then I took part time class after that\nBut I knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rack up three or four thousand dollars in the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank\nAnd they'd have half their half their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nAnd by the way it allows those kinda people 'cause I remember when I was in college my junior year I live with four guys in the house to model and\nFinancial aid and the other two were working which to do you think got a better you know get more out of their education you know ... and Steve I had to find your work and actually had to work to earn it so they actually knew the value of the education if you give something away to people for free they're not going to value it right I mean so I think\nWould be an area we could get a lot more workers we need to get the skills for the workers but you know what the the employers will give these workers the skills they will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or\nWe'll give these workers the skills they will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or you know be a welder or you know all these set by the way it ... you know what how drivers earning not and twenty thousand dollars oh\nLet me tell you I ran into a couple of guys who would come to a station event a listener event\nAnd I was younger guy and they just were friends\nAnd I said what do you do to the older guy and he said I run an electrical contracting business I said you know I tried to talk my step son into that I said I I Know there were both union and non union training programs where they would hire you and the rate two years ago was fourteen fifty an hour so it's like twenty nine thousand a year\nAnd every six months if you stayed in a program where you went to a class four hours a night for one night a week so it wasn't you know it was an asking\nYou to go sixteen hours a day all week long that at the end the tuition for was eighty bucks a month and it was unofficially state approved process where you at the end of four years you had eight thousand on the job training hours working at us and then and then you had six or seven hundred hours\nIn a classroom and every if you stayed in the program you started and fourteen fifty every six months your paycheck went up by a buck fifty an hour\nThree thousand bucks a year out\nAnd by the time you've finished you were thirty five dollars an hour Seventy grand a year that you could salary while I said to those guys said so that's where you're hiring your journey man he says large we can't get journeyman for thirty five bucks an hour he said we're paying forty\nTwo dollars an hour that's Steve that's Ninety thousand dollars a year to start as a journeyman electrician\nAnd you know what this is the same of that story is\nMeanwhile we spent two hundred thousand dollars and you know at cost the taxpayer to put these kids through college\nAnd a half of them are walking out with a sociology degree or ethnic studies degree or political science degree and guess what they're not jobs for a political science degree or a sociology degree you got to be able to do something you know and this was a failure or education system liars we're not preparing\nYou know these kids the twenty first century for the twenty first century house when I was in high school I don't know if you add this we had shop class\nSo we do know that we did not have any market\nYou know what they have their touchy feely classes now [laughter] it's just it's the education system is not a parent we spent\nTwo trillion dollars a year our education system hours but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians and Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we got to ... you know we've got to turn that around because there are there probably ten\nMillion Americans of working age that could be working and should be working but I don't even people with disabilities and it just because your dad back or something like that doesn't mean you can't work on the assembly line but you could be it over a driver or could you know work as a clerk I mean we need we need all hands on death by how how everybody working\nI've got I've got a suggestion Steven that is that in all these communities have got rid of the shop class and maybe even got rid of all the physical facilities what would happen if they went to some of the industries in their area and said hey we want to teach kids how to do shop but we need we need to\n... we'll give you the space in one of our buildings but what we need is we need some ... some ... and all this stuff for my shot glasses and and we're going to teach these kids how to do it and then you can do the final you know O. J. T. when they actually get on the job I have a feeling there industries out there would say we're not be happy to do that's\nHappening now that is happening the problem is they can't get enough kids to sign up for the classes well we moved to an ethic or somehow it's terrible to act to work with your hands in this country\nThat is sad Steve Moore is the author of\nWell we moved to an ethics or

from crack out all and why I was speaking yesterday to huge crowd and that went from Krakow to Amsterdam and have New York but you know what I'm feeling good and large it's good to hear your voice I'd rather it\nWas nice to talk to you as well so he is I mean we've seen the horror shows that are some of these science fiction movies about robot wars but would it be the worst thing in the world if\nSome of the battles that I guess have to be fought we don't have a worldwide conflict going on right now we're kind of in a in one of the most peaceful period in human history uh so yeah what would it be a bad thing if the combatants were machines rather than human beings\nYou know I I I think the short answer is no as long as they're all robots um you know there's the concern right now the largest is um there there is some\nOh we lost in ...\nNo I dare I say you were gone for a second and I was worried about you heading for a tunnel is if people want to get new there are ... you were saying no\nI I uh yeah hopefully it at some point I don't know I was saying that I Know I don't think that it's a bad thing that robots takeover combat you know said human lives and that's a good thing that concerned though is that\nWe're in countries are not up front about this uh so there's some question about it but a country like Russia for example\nHave been pretty a pretty clear that they want to create robots that will battles human\nAnd and that will have and this is and this is the kicker liars will have the ability to decide that that to to kill or not they'll be completely a ton of us mhm do you can imagine what kind of a or a scenario that can create\nUm if you have robots that have been given permission to go kill people\nI'm so that that's the concern but if it's all robot warfare and they become our surrogates in effect that you know it was less of a last robot stand is the winner um I don't think that's a bad thing you know I recently in Japan for example when they had that nuclear power\nA disaster they sent robots and to check check out the the melted core\nSo in cases like that we have very dangerous situations or ... outright combat I think that's um that's not a bad thing for robots take over from us\nLet me ask you this though doctor because we've had\nThe smart ends and smarter devices I mean the the the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were dumb bombs I mean they were ... yeah we were electronic to some degree but they were dumb and then we have smart bomb you're going to actually steered themselves\nSo when we talk about whether or not we would use a machine to fight against human beings human warriors are rather than putting our own people's lives up ...\n... where are we talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin and philosophical questions about if you can employers smart weapon to steers itself to the target and now you have a smarter weapon that not only steers itself to the target and decides which\nThe point of smart weapon to steers itself to the target and now you have a smarter weapon that not only steers itself to the target and decides which target to take out is there much of a topic will difference at the end of the day\nOr a good question Lars and probably not at the concern that is so all you need is one country to decide that they are going to create a toddler most combat ride robotic combat\nAnd that's going to force the hand of every other country to do the same thing so suddenly we're going to find ourselves\nIn a kind of a ... situation of the oval arms race during the Cold War when you know a Russia said well I have you know X number of evolves and us that well we have ... plus one number of Avon and you know ah that that can just escalates a situation where it's very very critical um\nI you know we're entering into some very unknown territory bottom line I think for for me looking at the immediate future and even right now\nUm the the thing that gives me the greatest concern our robots that are going to take people's jobs it's already happening and or in my new book uh uh the end of life as we know and I cite some studies recently that said you know up to fifty percent or more jobs right now\nCan be automated an hour and not just blue collar jobs large white collar pink collar\nOn a jobs and and that can sense because if you put people out of work what are they going to do\nWell my doctor I I Love this conversation we needed a schedule more time but we'll do that in another time because let me ask you didn't every forklift on a dock that unload just shift ship take away jobs of\nOf ten or twenty guys who would have used their backs\nOr a or a hand truck to manually you know so you got a whole bunch of strong guys and I think it was probably almost exclusively guys picking up sacks of grain or Saxon something or boxes or something and hauling it off and all of a sudden we have a a crane in a forklift\nAnd we didn't need to know those guys but we found jobs them doing other things were society did hasn't always been were progress has gone ...\nYeah and that's kind of the argument that ... make a movie we saw that even as recently as computers you know when computers took over you know we lost a lot of secretaries a lotta secretarial positions and others but then we created Silicon Valley\nWhich you see no point in huge numbers of people so in the best case scenario Lars that will happen that the for every say job takes over it'll create another jobs\nFor people who are who need to maintain those robots but there is a critical critical difference between a forklift or you know other kinds of mechanical aids we invented in the past and that is the robot is not\nDesigned nearly to do a single task it's actually designed to replace us period right and so we have computers now that are actually being developed to maintain the computers we have computers now that are even replacing a or threatening to replace computer ... a software developers\nWhich is the ultimate irony right that these computer developer is creating the robots that are going to put them out of a job so it's not\nI I'm waiting to see what will happen but that is the most optimistic that the most pessimistic though and and this is the pessimism that shared by some very credible people scientists of studies is that there won't be a um jobs created\nTo ... to offset the jobs that are lost\nAnd you know we often talk about robots taking over the world and revolting against humans or so forth but the thing that I discuss in my book that we really need to take\nWe often talk about robots taking over the world and revolt against your lives and so forth but the thing that I discuss in my book that you really need to take seriously is that people were if they find themselves\nYou know out of a job in their livelihood are stolen something and then I give examples of ... that was the opposite is still not once twice three times you know then what if people are going to do and that and that is a very real a danger and people in Silicon valley have what are all stuck out houses\nA witch and they'll be very upfront about about it that that's where they're going to treat it you know the ... ... if you know what hit the fan so um we don't know yet and that'll be great we still have control over it and that's why I've written this book so that people will be well armed can help make why\nWell I Want you to do that and maybe you and I could get together will make a business creating wouldn't shoes that can be thrown into the gears of the robots what what\nThere are fifty million and that one on on these specific programs would make them justify other than that take the whole deal we not department of Energy Department of education and simply do away with it there's a trillion dollars right there isn't it\nYeah well ... ... you and I were the same room right now I'd give you a big hug language\nBut specific I was like let's go back to the penny plan for a second yeah that's the one percent spending reduction act\nThat was introduced in this Congress by congressman Mark Sanford who unfortunately lost his primary been won't be returning to Congress but he has pushed that you cut one percent across the board of one percent of non interest spending so it doesn't apply to interest on the national debt but it applies to everything else you do that for five years you balance\nThe budget and then that bill would cap\nSpending at Eighteen percent of gross domestic\nProduct basically Eighteen percent of all economic output in the United states uh for for the foreseeable future that's what that bill would do\nThat would solve a lot of our problems in terms of the the looming entitlement and not sovereign debt crisis that we face here in the United states is the the problem here is we're looking at European welfare style or a rates of federal spending within a short time we are talking the next Twenty years that's what we're going to be spending and we cannot produce you cannot have\nStrong economic growth\nYou cannot create incentives to work in safe\nWith that level of spending it's going to crowd out private investment as people will be investing into government T bonds rather than investing in their business or the economy right those are the problems were ... those are problems we face and you're not going to be able to produce the amount of revenue unique because people are simply are going to be ... to work with the with the level of taxation well going to be needed\nTo to lower death\nOkay Jason another idea just wild I Do right now we have seven point one million unfilled jobs in America and I would if I were king but we're not a kingdom but if I were King I would say All right we're going to immediately say to every single state we're no longer paying for any social welfare benefits for this class of people\nEverybody who is above the age of Nineteen let's say and below the age of fifty five so working age able bodied son to mind\nA and we'll start with the kids who have no kids who the people who have no kids at home but we're soon going to get to the people who do have kids at home and say\nYou have to go get a job there seven million jobs go get one of them but we are like Paul ... page did a main saying we're not paying ... we're not paying food\nStamps for example he cut the food stamp rules by Seventy five percent in that group of people immediately when he said you have to work or you don't get food stamps and a lot of people just simply quit\nNow that would have to say but at least tens of billions wouldn't it if we did that to you know Medicaid food stamps tennis and all the rest of that razzmatazz oh abs\nAbsolutely yeah I Know and look the house to to their credit I mean I'm not the biggest fan of House Republican leadership but occasionally they do something right and they tried to do that in the farm bill this year was to add worker ... to uh to food stamps I'm ... and the granted the savings were reinvest it into work training programs which kind of a\nIt didn't defeat the purpose of just defeated the it just took the savings out of the bill but it would have saved billions of dollars\nA unfortunately the Senate decided not to pursue that in fact the Senate voted down I'm In an amendment offered by senators to think of Mike Lee and Ted Cruz that would have put welfare or work apartments on a snap benefits or food stamp benefits or the Senate's been has been and\nWill continue to be the source of most of our problems are and moving a more fiscally conservative agenda because there are too few fiscal conservatives and the Senate\nEven if we get a few more senators in November\nWell let me look that certainly numbers will improve their there are some ... there's some interesting prospects this year in terms of Senate races and I hope to see ah some of those come to fruition but [noise]\nYou certainly numbers will improve their there are some ... there's some interesting prospects this year in terms of Senate races and I hope to see uh some of those come to fruition but\nI'm the plot we have a problem you\nWe may be able to do things that we weren't able to do with more senators a Republican senators in the Senate but um you still have to ... it's all a numbers game at the end of the day and like one of the reasons we got a spending deal in February that blew up spending caps by three hundred billion dollars every two years is because we do not have enough fiscal conservatives not just for the Senate but the entirety of Congress\nYeah I wouldn't even mind seeing some reform over the Pentagon I still remember ... you know you and I've talked about this there was a guy named ... very smart guy and he was kind of he effectively was the CFO at the Pentagon you know he was the chief financial guy\nAnd I said why don't you know get the savings especially when you're having things bought for you that you say the Pentagon does anyone want this but Congress forced us to buy it\nAnd and he said we can move about three quarters of one percent of the Pentagon budget to Congress locks the rest of it down and we don't have any control over budget well you couldn't run Nike or Boeing or any of those companies if you said\nYou can change the budget but only this three quarters of a run for the rest of it yeah he's locked Jason I'm up against a break but ... during the great work to do it freedomworks and thank you so much with the time denied\nDiaper Jay large thank you very much of a good night\nAnd you as well Jason pies the VP of legislative affairs freedomworks now coming up at the moment most Americans say they don't\nWant to
