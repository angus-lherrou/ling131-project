curfews and in fact\nOf roads impassable and literally there are some beach front communities that\nAre simply knocked flat by the storm that hit and so you want to you want to think about those people and the ways that this country can help them out or many of them said they didn't leave because they said well this is all I've got I have to stay in protected\nBut when it gets to the end of the day I Would much prefer to see people evacuate save those lives\nAnd yet for such a devastating storm and the amount of damage if you've seen the over flight by drones of these areas\nCommunities just wiped out\nAnd I say that every single human life so it was lost his significant all six of them but that is a tremendously better results than this might have been if the same kind of storm it hit some other part of the world because you know do you routinely hear about storms like this take many many lives\nStill and all it would be nice to see more people evacuated leaves the things behind we can replace things we can't replace you\nThe Washington state Supreme Court has decided the capital punishment is racist an arbitrary and therefore today it issued a a decision\nThat you least in Washington state under the state constitution which means you can appeal this one to the U.S Supreme Court the capital punishment is unconstitutional\nThat means that the eight people on

fight because\nI occasionally by things on Amazon and I find that kind of convenient\nBut his Amazon getting so big that it could literally threaten our economy will Michael Doherty joins me now CEO of the cyber education foundation and founder of the justice society he's also the author of the devil inside the beltway which we've talked about before Michael welcome back to the program\nOh I don't get it back with you sir\nI'm doing very well so [noise] I like Amazon I Do business with them but I still do business with bricks and mortar stores a lot of other companies why do we now see Amazon is something so big it literally threatens our economy\nBecause a little baby tigers are cute and when they get around that kill ya okay [laughter] I don't know for ... and ... and conspiracy theory Thursday step either I'm really by ... and so I you know look\nIsn't it interesting how he started calling at Amazon from the beginning\nIt he pulls you and he does what we call loss leaders okay so we get so much money he loses money to undercut everybody else gains market control then you know\nPull in close enough to slap in the face and now he owns the Washington Post so he can control the message ... media there's ... ...\nAm not that bad I mean obviously they have done positive destruction they have challenging but this market dominance and this monopolistic behavior and and how brutal they are are too small business it is it's tough it's you know uh\nSo it's it comes to an antitrust level I mean by a large I Love the efficiency that he's built in and I I have time also and I like to challenge it to you know ... ... businesses will ... up as it was off the monopoly that'd be great\nYou know yeah well actually I wouldn't because you know Michael I've told I told my audience mild metaphor is not as good as your baby tiger metaphor but I've told them you know if you said what I like to be the only talk show host in America no because having competition sharpens my game and I'm afraid I'd get lazy if I was the only game in town\n[noise] right and and your your exactly right so why is the founding fathers decentralized power to unify towers\nBad with human beings that just governments so we have Amazon who now has the much you know these machines that listen to what they can understand what's going on as data\nFrom ... and and and you know the newspaper and the media it's you know it it's not about them it's turning into a true anti trust to play and that's where it's going to go\nWhat has the FCC had the securities and Exchange Commission had anything to say about this because they certainly regulate my industry heavily they tell radio companies you can only own somebody radio stations and every mark and we're not going to allow you to become dominant or is it not big enough yet to to trigger that\nI ... well of course you know when all anyone cares about the media today as Russia Russia Russia and they can't leave out from President they set the price we pay because you know ... ...\n... listen to these big tech companies you know how fast these guys got huge it's like that movie alien where it's almost a cute in the beginning and then like ten minutes in the movie is eight feet tall so you know and even like wait a minute what happened here or can it caught off guard\nBut he take companies also learned from Microsoft and the government jumped on micro\nMicrosoft stuff that they were in Seattle is having a nice life and hear Tom's Europe and the U.S now everyone learned from that and all\nYou know Amazon ... lobbying and they've got these beautiful beautiful offices in DC and sodas soda school Gulen soda stay stuck in there all break and bread and getting a number by I mean they're not down there protecting their turf and their shareholders so\nYou know it's um it's a tough situation we have our problems and our addictions with our Facebook and our Amazon Prime\nI guess what I worry about it but it is and this is the other worry I have Michael that even if we say well they're too big\nI got two responses one is you mentioned Sears and Roebuck well not no longer and they're about to go out of business would seemed\nBut back when Sears first came on the scene they had to be one of the first uh entities that enter the market place and said you don't have to buy your dung agrees with the local general store\nYou can just drop you know dropping out in the mail and they'll show up you know back to you and I imagine at the time it was probably viewed as pretty darned amazing to say\nUh you know I can you me I can order pots and pans and sheets and blankets and pillows and all that stuff and it'll just magically appear and I've got a lot more choice and you know and maybe a better price and everything else so Sears was kind of revolutionary back in the day I understand that Amazon is on that on steroids\nBut we were you know we're we're concerned at the time I'm sure there were probably concerns of the time that we're gonna wipe out the local general store will they didn't you know we have lots of these big retailers in America now and they didn't wipe out the local general store but I'm I guarantee you they had an effect\nThe second concern I have is this um that\nAs we're in a world market place now if we say Amazon we've got a break you up into pieces to make sure you don't get too big wheeled China and other countries have the same constraints because remember when it's a worldwide service I mean a worldwide Internet\nIf you say Amazon can't get big but China can have a you know uh you know can have companies that are that big\nAre we going to see the day where we've knocked down our own Goliath our own Amazon and we've allowed all the other countries that don't have the same kind of restraint to do it and now Americans will be buying from them instead\nI can I can buy a small business part because although I saw what they did to publishing the government part I I'm a little bit less less empathetic on because you know apple apple\nAmazon and the the rights and the constitution of belief and the human rights things that they just look the other way when they do business as ... Tories a lead me to believe that if we put our foot down they're not going to go out running we're not going to give our power away\nWant to practice and do business there they don't necessarily want to be there so\nUm it it just and this is the topic for discussion and there is no right or wrong answer up because they have done a lot of really good innovation\nAnd that's good but there's also a lot of crushing going on and when it depends on the swings to find the other direction which I don't think we're totally there yet in most areas uh then we've got a problem at but\nYou know these people get so much money they do more profit margin is more than the economy's most country yep\nSo which is very careful about this and\nTheir interaction with our regulatory cars that regulatory and the ... in the country is it's pretty lousy ah we all all care about them for some of the United states not education and\nThat these regulations his lawyers with a you know law suits and they're they're they're a joke and they want jobs that those companies later so it's it's tough to hold them accountable that's why I think the anti trust ways the only place to go and I'm Wondering what the the judicial system or not it'll handle it off\nI just worry that some day we'll have the Chinese equivalent of Amazon selling to us and it'll all come in big shipping containers will say remember when we used to be able to buy from an American company called Amazon and now we're going from you know a big company in China unless we could figure out a way to say you can't sell into our marketplace which\nSo far we have not done Michael Doherty is the author of the devil inside the beltway the shocking expose a of the U.S government surveillance an overreach into cyber security medicine in small business Michael it's a pleasure to have you on the program\nYou sir good talking again glad to have you on\nBy the way the liberals are taken off the gloves and they're fighting dirty encounter says the conservative should do the very same thing and we'll get to your phone calls and your emails and eight six six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk\nIt off he took no for an answer who cares if he whipped it out to an underlying as governor of the state so maybe we can at least get Gloria Steinem under oath to explain why um it is just qualifying for a drunken college freshman to do that something I don't think anyone believes Brett Kavanaugh ever did\nAnd there are certainly no corroboration evidence witnesses or contemporaneous statements to back it up I'm ... but in theory what the accusation was something that it's just qualifying for drunk college freshman to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and\nI'm the first accuser the one who's um testimony was what was supposed to be believable because people watched her and while she sure looks credible to me um but hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years\nAnd what do you do when no one backed it up at me and what about that front door she she had a front door because the two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house\nThis is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in um she said that she rent they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or interns as she called them oh I think those interns are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that is a door to a rental apartment\nThat's a lie under oath or fear of flying um that certainly seems to me to be false and as much as ... jets all over the globe to go surfing\nUm who paid for the for the polygraph will I guess she corrected that one about whether she'd ever coached anyone on a polygraph or live in six your ex boyfriend\nSays that he was present when she was coaching one of her friends on how to take a polygraph something she was asked about under oath and denied um you know the next the next hearing\nOn the next Supreme Court justice to go and and\nBe replaced and I have a few guesses about who that might be um it's it's going to be it's going to be an absolute disable make having all look like a day at the beach\nAnd what's the thinking I mean I'm just to some extent do you think prosecutors and destroying the more local cases are afraid to do this for fear of being accused by the meat to crowd of you're attacking\nWomen know you're attacking a liar you're attacking a writer so so what will it take to get those people to get a backbone\nAnd say we will go after every truly guilty sex offender in America but if you lie and try to falsely accused somebody you too will face consequences\nNo in fact I think they should face the consequences of what they were accusing the other person of um false accusations of rape have sense have sent innocent men to prison um while I'm there's gotta be some some repercussions for that\nWell and and but where do you see the venue for being able to do I mean I'd like to do it but how do we do it I mean do you put pressure on the local prosecutor who's got the call it's not often as often going to be a federal cases local case so how do we get this to change to where we we said this is part of taking you serious way\nThat we take your ... your true accusation so seriously that when we find a ... one where I drew equally hard how do we get that dynamic shift because right now I think most prosecutors would rather do anything in the war in and go after a fall ...\nIt it's older men ideal oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward no actually we do want to discourage that\nWe don't want people's lives being ruined um but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims um if you go after false accusers of rate\nUm there's a there's a movie out now about Brian Banks at an age a I'm really bright had a bright future when he was falsely accused of rape in high school served five years in prison\nUm God out his accuser called I Apologize to them and said she made it up I guess he got it on tape\nHe got the conviction or race they made a movie about it but unfortunately it came out in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings\nSo what's gotten zero perhaps that's this guy Brian Banks I tweeted a review of the movie um yesterday I'm but I'm dying to see it I've just I've just read the review and think of it this guy's life was completely I mean it's a horrible horrible thing that's being done and there has to be consequences for it\nWell I'm going to do this in the next time I talked to any politician on their side they're all I'm going to say to them would you like to see us go after the fall to ... justice as to as tough as we go after those who are making a legitimate one her latest book\nIs called resistance is futile how the Trump aiding loved lawsuits collective mind and thank you so much with the John good luck to you largest but I talk to you as well\nHe's the death penalty races to an arbitrary Washington for the Washington Supreme Court decided that issue today we'll talk about what a top prosecutor

seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com one of those\nThe falling to pieces they've lost over and over again they I Know they keep talking a good game about how the midterms are going to be there whether they're going to win in the midterms\nAnd then they pull off a stunt like the false accusations against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and that is starting to work against them so now they've decided to go rogue embracing violence of law ... behavior saying when they go high or when ... when they go low will kick 'em\nA road runner McDaniel joins us now is chair of the Republican National committee it's good to have you back on the program\nIt's great to be here thanks for having me\nI Am thrilled to have you on the program I just want to know what is the best way for Republicans to respond to this when some of the top figures in the Democratic party\nAre actually out openly inciting violence there doing it on camera there doing it quoted in major media\nAnd so apparently they're not afraid to say when we don't get the result we want we're we're going to go out and engage in violence and we're going to incite other people's to commit violence\nAnd all of this not too terribly long after Congressman Steve ... very nearly lost his life because the left he decided to try and slaughter a group of Republicans on a baseball field do they know what they're doing and and do they understand how the American people are probably going to respond to this\nIt's a very dangerous path that the Democrat leadership uh\nIs putting their party on and it's a dangerous for our country when you hear Eric Holder said when they go low kick 'em Cory Booker saying get in their face Maxine Waters saying get crowds around people\nSomething's gonna happen we already had it Scully sketch shot we've already seen crowds over around Ted Cruz and chairs and there's an other cabinet members but this is not what we want for our country and I think Americans are looking at the essence saying it's not Democrats not just regular average\nPeople this is the leaders of their party advocating for this and I think Hillary Clinton what she said it's so remarkable it's a seismic shift in our democracy for her to say we will not be civil\nUnless we're power what a threatening thing to say\nIt is not at all unless wind power\nRun it you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of standing in the grocery store watching some poor mom deal the four year old and the serial Iowa who's decided usually it's a little boy who started stamping his feet and screaming at the top of his lungs and he's not going to be civil till the captain crunch goes into the grocery bag is good and and it's the behavior you\nKind of expect from some kids who are poorly raise is not the kind of behavior do you expect from top members of the Democratic party saying we're gonna continue to be ... in civil I'm not sure which one is probably an civil or until you give us power back and we're going to scream and yell and and probably\nHurt some people do they understand that the next time God Forbid but we did it almost seems inevitable that someone does get hurt or somebody does carry on a real active of violence\nThat they're going to catch the blame on this\nI think so and I I think they're they're playing their cars in a way that they're hoping will engage their faith and turn them out and do angry division I mean with the Democrats have run\nOut division for a long time but this is a new low for their party and it's frightening for our country we've already seen some instances that are frightening with these college we've seen our senator having had security detail this is not something we want long term for our country and the Democrats need to be called out and\nI'm saying is the chairman of the Republican Party I don't want you to go get Democrats basis I don't like it they'll interrupt their family dinners or ... miles around them what you should do is go though\nFriends volunteer stand up for the people you know but we can do it in a civil way and that is the greatness of our country and Democrat leaders need to be called out and I hope\nThat the voters are looking at this because the only way we show the Democrats that they lose that this message is by them living in these terms the only way we bring back stability to Washington is it reached jak\nThe playbook that they've been riding on his temper tantrum that day that drive for two years now\nRon can I I Want to suggest something do I do this every time you're on I put a bug in Europe and I I don't know if it's you know if you if it's worth what it costs you let's put it that way\nBut I Would love to see since I Know the mainstream media will not do the thing they should do which is go to a Democrat leaders leaders in say will you condemn these calls for violence now\nI compared the other night I was in Seattle for a a form of a panel with a bunch of other tacos from one of my affiliations KB I\nAnd somebody said you know should we go out and let's go out and have some big protests I said it's never been the style of Republicans or conservatives especially to do that you have nice family friendly gatherings like the Tea Party that leaves the landscape cleaner than when they arrived\nWe just don't do things that way they do and that's not just one of these where I'm trying to say on our side doesn't we don't\nYou know I as you can name any number of instances of left wing violence you don't see it from the right\nBut because the media won't call them out and I'm Talking about individual reporters can we get Republican officeholders and Republican office seekers to start demanding I mean the president is is you know understands that when you push the buttons of media\nIf we saw some Republican stand up in front of a crowd of reporters whenever they were holding a an event of some kind words covered and say why aren't you folks\nAsking for condemnation of this because I Will condemn it tonight and if if the Republican men and women are in office and seeking office would start demanding that I think the media can only ... ignore it so long and then they'll have to acknowledge well maybe we do need to go to Hillary Clinton and say\nYou just you just try to incentivize violence why are you not condemning violence because ordinarily that's sort of the you know the go to for the Democrats in this case they should be uh I I think we should all their feet to the fire\nI agree and and we just put together a video that was released today showing some of these ... that have been created a along with the words of the Democrat leader as we are definitely trying to hold Democrats accountable and you're right immediate need to do it and we need to help\nPush the media to act in a way that they don't always do because we know if it were a Republican who is that these things they'd be all over us so\nWe're going to continue to set an example of civility we're going to continue to run on the issue is the results that have happened to that said meditation that has made life better for millions of Americans straight quite set up ... percent unemployment\nFor a million jobs wait is that so many great things are happening across this country and legal contrast that with the resistance and the division and the destructive nature of the Democrat Party and hopefully on November sex that voters will reject\nThis terrible terrible a message that Democrats continue to\nBecause you remember back to the beginning of the campaign when President Trump then candidate Trump would go to various venues and he was in generating gigantic crowds\nAnd I can't remember who was Cleveland or another city where they literally had to shut the event down because of the folks who came in as interlopers intending only to cause trouble and and when the president responded I think there were a couple of times when as a candidate he said\nAnd they were at the media was all over oh my God are you in are you inciting violence or you endorsing violence big you know they will do that as you say if it's a Republican who does at a conservative who says something if I took to the air and said let's go out the streets in burns and things like antifa does which I Would never do\nA you know that that that would be condemned quickly so if the media won't if individual reporters won't do it on their own I think we should get our candidates to search shaming them into it why aren't you asking\nThe other side as good folks who are seeking reelection governor Kate Brown and the state where I broadcast ask her are you willing to condemn these kinds of tactics and the statements of Eric Holder when they go low let's kick up will you condemn that and if you want why not I think it might be effective run\nWho's written a book about gods now to two specific things and I think to conservatives these issues are familiar that kept the media way one it involved abortion although not abortion the way it is done legally and rights but done murder of slaughterhouse and I don't think I'm over it\nNow he was black yeah it's funny actually it's funny somebody just real to me and said to me are you worried about being called racist\nI was working on this story for nearly two years before I realized with black you just knew the name I just didn't know I met him I mean I I met him I Know I never noticed he was black and I know that might sound weird to people but it's like the least interesting thing about him like I literally didn't taking notes of his ... of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's the Seventy two year old doctor who delivered baby alive and then cut the next with scissors and it's like somebody said to me you know he's black and I went oh God yes he is actually but I ... we had never thought of I mean and I'm telling you the God's honest truth my husband and I neither of\nNoticed that he was black now tell me about this\nThe most interesting thing I think about your ... shoes you got a chance to sit for three hours and talk to this man in person yes where are you in the same room or your through\nGlass no I was in the same room and I I was wondering why yeah well not good because I expected to have the glass I thought we were going to have the ... the protection of the Plexiglas and in fact\nActually we're in this kind of coffee lounge where he had you know very free reign he was allowed to even move his chair and what he did was he came in I was backed up against the door about against ah against the wall and he pushed his share opened his legs and kind of trapped me between his legs if you know what I mean I my legs cross\nAnd then to continuously touched my my my knee as he would make points and it's on sorry once I'm terribly sorry\nAnd he was like you know kind of electric kind of character he has his men less Lewis voice the soft voice\nHe smiles all the time kind of laugh you know and here he is serving three life sentences and talks about you know it was an awful shame you didn't get into the poetry class and and that he's reading the Koran in two different versions two different translations because he's just ... like this\nAnd you know he's getting to play a lot of music which is great you know when he listens to a lot of music and you know he really liked reading and hasn't been able to read because he's been so busy all these years\nBut again to read true crime which he really enjoys I mean you're sitting there and he by the way he sang to me twice in the middle of this yeah because he was talking about music and then he said you know all you know when I started listening to ... you know ... and every now and again during the three hours he would do this brand free thing where he'd say what's the name what's the name\nAnd I love ... by the way the Belgian crude or who died I bet a lot of your listeners would know him he had a big smoker and I think he just basically smoked himself to death\nBut he had this incredible voice and goggles looking at me saying what's the name what's the song what's the name of that song on the same as well and I'm sitting there thinking do I tell them do I tell them at the ... and then of course I say you know kind of through clenched teeth Nicki the ... and then he leans right in Maine goes I mean the key to a\nAnd start singing the song basically don't ever leave me you know it's like are you serious as this what's happening right now yeah so that was a guy has\nNo sense of what he's done or or the reaction that most people would have if you just generically told the story I mean the left out the door but just said he murdered a couple of ... and does anyone know for certain how many babies were put to death by by having their spines Nicolas pursue one according\nTo the grand jury you know which I think you know if you think of how long they stopped with this and heard evidence they said ...\nIt was not and that is why exactly as you said in your introduction it is very safe to say he's America's biggest serial killer and you know John Wayne gave the Ted Bundy the Soviet killer all of them combined\nCome nowhere near that so this guy and you know the only reason he's not on the list of the most prolific serial killers in America is the only reason is because you'd have to acknowledge the humanity of those children\nAnd that is something that we want to do we want to make sure he gets the title because these were human beings I've seen the photographs of them I can tell you these are these are children who may world will never no no and we need to acknowledge them and be a you know be a witness to the fact that they lived and and it's not an overreach\nTo call his clinic an average for ... that it was\nAnd all the aspects of the slaughterhouse yes would you mind describing you know it's interesting I think one of the words don't do this in the movie on a wire and we don't do that for the movie but we do do it in the book and I would warn you brought that Steve ... is one of the ... and we don't feature see myself in the in the movie at all but see myself with one of the people who helped gospel\nAnd he was one of the people who get was a witness and described conditions in the clinic\nAnd he said that the the blood ran down the walls he said they were just so many of them Iran which sisters\nI was a fireman in hell\nThese are the guy on the road to this is what he said under oath he's serving Fifteen Years himself

shy away we have we don't really ill\nZone or seen any Oval Office President Trump sitting at the resolution that seat\nAcross from him rap artist Kanye West wearing a red make America great again hat it was something about when I\nOff and make you feel like Superman made of Superman that was about ... favorite superhero stop and frisk does not help the relationship\nWe can do it a different way Kanye totally off we have to release the love of liberal would try to control a black person to the concept of race and I love this guy right here is you know let's\nWe don't look good so he might not have expected to have a crazy mother like Kanye West\nWas that was pretty impressive I Love this guy right [laughter] that's really that's where the heart I didn't want to put you in that position [laughter]\nThat's from the heart special guy\nYeah wow it was it was crazy it was chaotic Jim round was there to buy them so they interviewed Jim Brown afterwards and he said and here's a guy who was you know this guy who face\nRacism in a way that a younger generation\nHas not face no matter how much they want to scream and yell about all the micro aggressions that stuff if we're honest with ourselves a grandpa great grandfather great great grandpa face raises and the kind of\nRacism which is thank goodness\nSlowly but surely it's never going to be gone but it sure the hell water isn't what it once was and they asked him and this is the guy who was an outspoken civil rights leader of the time and yet is issues as well uh Jim Brown the great football player but first of all I kept calling ... ... a ... a a ... but he uh\nHe said like I don't think anybody should Neal we're a family and we need to figure things out because they talked about yes a\nPolicing all kinds of things it was all over the place and at times it was surreal Kanye was holding court and it was interesting but he said and and people always say why is the right obsessed with the ...\nIt was holding court and it was interesting but he said and and people always say why is the right obsessed with Kanye and there are so happy for him and I said it's not the fact that he likes the president doesn't like the president because I don't think he agrees everything with the president I really don't but the fact is is he's got a platform\nHe like some of the stuff their egos match each other\nRight they're both married to a powerful women and in and they may they get each other right like they get each other but\nIt's the fact that he doesn't go in step into with the left\nThat he's willing to go I really don't care I'm doing my own thing\nRight I'm doing my own thing but something ... and and and I said this to do a couple of ... to me it's like why are you guys are obsessed and I said it's because you cheered him when he said George Bush hates black people write you cheered him but now when he's not on that same kind of path you're pissed off and angry\nRight he then he was a genius now he's insane so that's what you're going to do but he said something day and I said even if he's in St guys just want to understand this\nJust because he may have some screws loose and he was kind of all over the place that doesn't mean that some of the stuff he's not saying doesn't have valid points\nWhere I have Saturday Night live to approve auto the liberals are improve on it if he don't\nWe don't look good\nTrump told the truth is these rights and online and that is true some I've been saying something I've been saying over and over and over and over and over again but we want to see the other side's fail\nIs ridiculous\nIt is absolutely ridiculous to want to see the other side fall apart\n\nBecause that's the way you feel you can get power is ridiculous to hope that the president fails to Bill Maher saying I Hope we have a recession the people cheering fourteen hundred points coming off the Dow in two days because they're hoping this happens is insane that's that is for that is not patriotic is at all\nThe roads ... not it's it's it's a sad\nSad thing but he was all over the place he was a the ... thing was just just crazy they talked about all kinds of stuff uh you know and and to me it was it it was again it was surreal moment in the White House\nWhen we make everything that China and not in America that were cheating on our country and we're putting people in for that happens to a legal they ended up she factory on the president's\nYeah but I mean it's different I mean he\nHe said a lot of stuff that I think it was a bit out there like that's one of one of the reasons that people make stuff cheap everywhere and Trump have been fact checked them on Foxconn and a few other things but some of the reasons that people do the things that they do like go elsewhere is because we hear demand cheap goods\nBut I understand what he was trying to do and I think he said some stuff today that was real and and just because you don't like him because he's not on your team anymore as far as what goes because he's wearing a make America great again hat just because of that doesn't mean that all the things that he thinks should be discounted because a lotta times\nIt's true right\nHe had to go off on some wacky tangents he did he did he absolutely did he went off some crazy stuff and you're just like he said he's bipolar but not by polar is a genius to test the Ninety eight percent dial it was all over the place to be showing Trump stuff on phones because apparently wants to design cars I don't know it is what it is but it was a surreal\nYou have said dial he was all over the place to be shown Trump stuff on phones because apparently wants to design cars I don't know it is what it is but it was this surreal moment in the White House today three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us\nBut you're black and you're a baby sitter what do you hear this story is Amazon to big we're going to touch on that as well\nIt is the message you\nWon't deeds theloop won't Dee Dee school poop\n\n\n[noise]\nSuch shed bench and show [noise]\n\nIndeed knows it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring like finding a unicorn when you post your job on indeed it's easy to find people with skills\nFor a lot of people whose lives depend on this kind of stuff but\nSaudi Arabia let's be real we like them because they have the Iranians that's it they ... they had the Iranians that's why we like them\nThat's it\nHow many of the appeal of Nineteen remember that remember remember nine eleven remember that remember all of them how many of them were from Saudi Arabia there are some issues here absolutely but\nTrump's looking at it in a different way of saying well you know what it sounds horrible we need to figure this entire thing out we've got to start figuring this thing out and saying that a hundred and ten million dollars that's that's a lot of money can be coming to the United states and they're going to spend it and there may spend it with somebody else to know those those people\nAre going to get the money China or Russia and what are they going to do it\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three out you had been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you so a\nVery interesting the the whole question of the day is one of third parties you know when I saw what did I you know you've got Tonya in there and he's doing his Kanye stuff 'cause that's what ... does and it was interesting it was holding court\nUh but my question is you know why can't we talk to one of the civility is gone and we're going to dig deeper into a little bit later but we need a solid\n\nThird party and here's the thing the stuff that I talked about before when it comes to authorities we don't need a third party that's equal you can make a lot of noise\nBeing strong and small meaning if you took twenty seats thirty seats in the house maybe five or six seats in the Senate right you'd take anywhere between you know you've got intended Fifteen Percent\nYou can do a lot of things you can\nCan do a lot of things and I think we need a real party and I'm Talking about the Green Party right with Jill Stein I'm not talking about Gary Johnson because a guy\nThat he just it was awful can we just admitted right like can we right I'm not talking about ... insane although everyday film last and he's like he's not just wants to talk about bitcoin as he's running for president block jade and said I'm not talking about talking about somebody in a party that is real\nBut I think could ... it you know can see all sides and is there more for the most of the times I think the referee and the random in the mature party will call [laughter]\n[noise] what do you think though would you be open and could you be open to a third party that is not insane that's not crazy but a real party fifty percent used before so yes I can four percent say no forty six percent says depend on the politics and I think the politics would be very much an independent minded\nLook at things and so let's just say let's let's break this down how this would work\nSo you've got a party that is somewhat in power right the has the most you can get a plurality just your\nRight but you've got a party that's got then you've got another party here so the Republicans Democrats one of those who's going to have the most seats the second seats is gonna be the other one the third is the one that's going to be swayed because you know those who can't stand each other and right now it's worse than ever before so what ends up happening is they're going to have to come to you to get stuff done\nAnd if you're able to say look I understand what you're doing there and I agree with this this and this but you know what if you want our vote you got to get rid of this you gotta get rid of this you got to get rid of this because I see it from their side too so it is a way to move things\nBut this this and this but you know what if you want to vote you got to get rid of this you gotta get rid of this you got to get rid of this because I see it from their side too so it is a way to move things through and that might be the best way to break the gridlock\n\nIn many ways just like being an independent who do both sides cater to come election time who was the vote they need the independence because they're the ones that are going to sway 'cause we're so driven\nAnd separated right now they got to come and they gotta go okay okay okay ... we need your vote what do we have to do I think in a bigger way if we can do something like this I think I Would change the law three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned show is your Twitter babysitting while black\nI'm babysitting right ... I got I got two kids in American women are made with a lady across the street with the parents are somewhere warmer this lady over here she's following me because I got two kids and a vaccine that does not look like me\nSo that guy right there cordless his name and he is babysitting and it doesn't mentoring program and and you know he looks to be in his mid twenties early thirties kind of thing and he's got like a eight and ten year old boy and girl in the back and they happened to be white and he happens to be black and there's a woman who was worried that these two kids have been taken\nAway\nSnatched from their parents because stranger danger is everywhere this lady for the fire itself to say that she's going to say my place now I call the police presence [noise]\nThis is twenty eight seeing this what I got to do it I Can't go out with two kids that do not look why me in without something weird feet of a sudden I'm moving she's harassing me because I have two kids that do not look like ...
