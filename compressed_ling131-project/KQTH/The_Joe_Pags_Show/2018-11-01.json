phone calls and emails shortly at eight six six eight large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails to talk at Lars Larson dot com Dr Victor Davis Hanson joins me senior fellow at the Hoover Institution historian the author of twenty three books\nThe upcoming book called the case for Trump but I also want to mention Dr Hansen's mix of foreign ya a state of becoming a that's from a few years ago but he knew what was coming out as Dr Hanson thank you for the time tonight welcome to the\nProgram oh sorry about that or we go sorry about that Dr welcome to the program but about thank you for having me didn't push the right button that ... that happens from time to time that you wrote\nOut what I thought was an absolutely brilliant piece that I Want people to read it American greatness about what you see is some of the internal contradictions of the caravan of whatever has now fourteen thousand or ... thousand or seven thousand people that are aiming to march all the way to the American border where do you see those contradictions\n[noise] well I mean don't you think that the entire open borders movement is sort of predicated on a grievance against the United states is in a phobic or\nRacist or national outstrip catch notes and yet people want to come in here so the obvious conclusion is so bad why wouldn't you just stop when you get across the border of Mexico and enjoy a similar cultures similar language or\nEnvironment and you wouldn't have to go on to this area that people and they open borders little and has a shortage says so hospitable immigrants and ... that's one of them\nAnd Mexico as offered said you can stay here if you want to have an ... doesn't that actually change their refugees that if he's if you say I'm fleeing persecution you get to a friendly country in Mexico says day if you want to will will help you you know get set up here and you say I'm no I'm not interested you're no longer a refugee\nOr you\nWon but thanks so but also one of the the checks of white people are living in ... and loose with the media has recorded a lawlessness\nOf Central America where the country's excluding Costa Rica has\nCreated such a form of violence they have to leave but then the answer to that lawlessness is too low asleep cross the Mexican border and then ... enter the United states and then laws they continue to resolve again\nAnd that almost begs the question I mean or east Central American countries lawless because of the collective values of the population some some cases\nAnd that is if people don't see the contradiction that they're breaking the law because they're angry about others breaking the law then why would they come to the United states and not assume they can continue\nTo break the law which causes reasons for them to leave in the first place\nYou know Dr I literally play the sound by last night that griffey Jenkins of Fox News God he was interviewing just some random caravan go or through a translator and he asked the man why he was coming to America and he said well I'm coming to America to ask for a pardon for the class three felony that\nHe had been found guilty of in America attempted murder and uh I think Jenkins is a little taken aback this guy was just talking about yeah I've got an attempted murder and I think I'll go to America and see if they'll cleared up for me uh the\n... not ... not an accusation but a conviction and and these are some other people that are coming north and the care of it\nYeah I I think is also a contradiction here in the United states that allow the advocates\nAll that are coming north and the caravan\nYeah I I think there's also a contradiction here in the United states that a lot of the advocates\nOf open borders are welcoming the caravan do so in the abstract but the concrete or manifestations of their advocacy will fall on Hispanic communities where their schools will be impacted\nOr climate will increase for African Americans will have to compete with entry level jobs are just rural people where I live where we've had a lot of gang incidents by people improperly admitted on Central America into California and that and I can attest first and that it's sometimes\nQuite dangerous and the ... rural neighborhood that used to be quite safe but the people that you'd get want this to happen the polo Caesar the Dianne Feinstein which struck Schumer's\nI'm On the shore of Mark Zuckerberg's they don't they seem to have a capital either to select neighborhoods are walls around they're all ... states or private schools for their children that they're always immune\nFrom the ramifications of or ideology I think that's what gets people angry because they feel that it's an elite enterprise at sort of a pure metal alliance between the very poor abroad and the very wealthy at home without consideration of how that affects the middle class is growing the United states\nI'm Talking to Dr Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the author most recently of the brand new book coming out to in March of next year the case for Trump\nAnd of course the there is one of his parents' books max of ... state of becoming so among the other contradictions of the caravan is it now I mentioned this moment to go there they're not truly refugees\nToo in that case why why are reporters and wire American citizens seeming will seemingly willing to buy the story that they're refugees when most of them are in the interviews I've seen them say I want to come to America because the jobs pay better there\nYeah I think part partly people are naive and they always want to be under privileged on that may lead to some of that and the the more likely I mean this was more or less time on to 'em criteria one was that when that happened in July\nWas the media spectacle of children separated from their parents and it resulted in immediate drop and Trump's approval ratings for about four or five points in a surge in fundraising the Democratic party's you don't mean primaries in ... and so I think people thought people being\nSympathetic people bought it and make perhaps here as well but if we time another caravan and lives in or near midterms then we'll have the same crisis effect Trump will probably react in a way that does not\nAppear therapeutic are sympathetic and made me right before the midterm Lincoln across that approval rating is six or seven points five points and down ballot battle held back because I think it's kind of our long including children on it with the caravan come and it's on our mind and then that knows right on the eve of the metro\nAre these people coming north and are those people who've entered recently are they likely to assimilate into America the way other generations have seen people from Europe and and uh from even Eastern Europe as well as Western Europe assimilate into our culture and become part of what is\nThe American culture all Americans but but with characteristics that we bring from all kinds of different background\nYes and no I mean I live in an area that second third generation Mexican Americans who came legally and measured numbers are and the ... and they came with people as you mentioned of all these other countries are complete assimilated\nLegally and measured numbers are and the ... and they came with people as you mentioned all these other countries are completely assimilated and married to emigrate\nImpediment so that you know caught bought those who are usually when people come from this area and mouth\nWithout ... without English without skills rotate in and they outreach education from people come in young males Latin America it's not high school diploma without a high school on average so that means people are going to comment on play\nSpeak Spanish not have the skills immediately to compete be dependent on\nA public entitlements will give them just enough to get by but create sort of a resentment when they see the vast wealth around them and they're forced to work and then the level of job without access because they don't lose their not educate them not legal to upward mobility so we know\nWhat works and what ... ... unfortunately we noticed it on the left\nField that when people come illegally and mouse and without easily assemble assimilation skill they tend to vote and block equal ... that's been true since the nineteenth century and I think that's\nPart of what's driving and you look at California it's split from a purple go blue state largely because of Latino immigration so has a lot about us so it was Colorado\nThe government says you're not an American citizen so he used to saying well yes I Am I was born in the United states is subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and the court in that case says\nNo you you're not a citizen when you were born at the time you were born you were born subject\nIn large part to the jurisdiction\nAn own sovereignty to your tribe so you were not in that in the moment you were born you are not subject completely to the jurisdiction of the United states and you are not a citizen and so that was something that as you noted as it wasn't under the fourteenth amendment Congress ... years later passed\nA law granting citizenship to Native Americans or should they accepted that she should they should their tribes be okay with that and so that was not something another fourteenth amendment and in fact something that the courts and and everybody involved the greed\nOr even though they were born in the United states the geographic United States they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states under the fourteenth amendment\nNow Amy I'm Talking to Amy swear who've legal policy analyst in heritage\nHere's the phone or your issue except I think this one's got a simple answer too but I'm a non ... so you know I don't worry about billable hours I don't have to make things complicated ah the president says I can fix those were the executive order and I of all these losers who's very large you didn't like what Obama did and I said no I didn't like it when Obama\nSaid I Want to train federal immigration law says you have to trick the DACA kids out because that's what the law said and he tries to fix the law by signing a piece of paper as though that is ... you can change the law by Sonny ... paper you can't\nPresident Trump does not proposed to change the constitution or amended he does not proposed between federal law he merely says\nAll the way along the federal bureaucracy has recognized or has said in effect the the the fourteenth amendment says if you're born here no matter what your circumstances you're an American citizen we're now going to change that interpretation can he do that with an executive order\n[noise] well so what let me start off by saying that it's incredibly hard to speculate because we don't have\nAn executive order in front of us don't have the language of what he purports to deal with it but that being said this is very very different from a for instance what you saw under DACA where\nThe Congress passed a law there are laws regarding the deportation of people who are in the United states illegally and the Obama administration essentially said we don't like that we're going to prioritize so that certain individuals are not deported and also on top of that even though Congress gave us no authority to do this we're going to uh make it so that\nCertain individuals have legal status or outside of what Congress has stated that that's a lot different from a president saying look\nThere is no clear authority especially not from the Supreme Court not from Congress as to what the fourteenth amendment means with regard to the children of illegal aliens and so it would be well within his his\nConstitutional authority to say a instruct\nExecutive agencies who issued passports and Social Security numbers that they're going to to execute the laws in a manner that is\nConsistent with this very limited view of of who isn't\nThere's a that they're going to to execute the laws in a manner that is\nConsistent with this very limited view of of fluids and who is not a citizen that given that Congress hasn't really said one way or the other and at the Supreme Court certainly has not\nRuled on that but especially not in the last hundred and Twenty years and so it's two very different situations there um but again hard to speculate we don't actually know what this executive order might say\nBut at least we finally get tested that she will I mean I'm sure it'll be fairly quickly challenged by someone although do they have to wait until somebody is through harmed in the eyes of the law by the implementation of this before they're going to actually ...\nAh yeah it might make guesses you would see just like what the travel ban almost immediately dozens if not hundreds of lawsuits being filed asking\nFor an injunction a almost certainly one would be granted by some judge somewhere with a nationwide injunction uh and and it would ultimately given the gravity of of the question at the serious nature of it it hits at the core of of the constitution\n... there's no way that would avoid the Supreme Court other than\nThey dismiss it on some sort of jurisdiction all thing um but but ultimately it it's a question of Supreme Court hasn't touched for about a hundred and Twenty years uh and showed an executive order the issues they there is a good chance at that at the executive order does anything meaningful it's going to make its way to the Supreme\nCourt and is there any doubt in your mind that the fiber originalist will vote to say we're going to go with the original meaning of the fourteenth amendment or do you think there's a question there about how the ... vote\nI think there's there's always a question when you're dealing with medical especially when you don't have the order in front of you um you know and it it's always hard to speculate what I can say is that it it is heritage is position and that is the position of of many\nOriginalist scholars that it is very clear based on the jurisdiction all history or sorry on on the um\nThe legislative history that the original intention what Congress intended to do with it what you give citizenship only two children who were born in the United states were subject to a complete jurisdiction\n[noise]\n\n\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you're a fifty year old male

classics\nSo they'd been proved to all the products but nothing really that jumped right out they said there's the new retina display sure seen the retina display on some of their products and it's a very pretty screen I mean if you're looking at photos and things like that it's it's great if you're watching a movie it's great but but nothing really dramatically new right\nNo this was not a major product announcement a lotta times apple like to use these sort of off cycle announcements right before the holidays to announce new things we didn't see anything that we hadn't seen before a lot of updates on existing products you mentioned the high rise retina display and that's been out for six years and the ... pro so it's about\nIt's new things we didn't see anything that we hadn't seen before a lot of updates on existing products you mentioned the high rise renting a display and that's been out for six years and the nakba pro so it's about time that the air Sadat display\nAll right let's talk about Congress I mean Congress we talked about almost every day but\nAre they going to do something about Google and Facebook when it comes to data privacy and uses their job to safeguard the data or to force a private company to safeguard the data of its customers or is that the job of the company and the job of the consumer to be a you know consumers aware that there is a threat out\nThere yeah in certainly large I think it has to start with the consumer the consumer how to me ultimately responsible for knowing where their data is going and if you promise the Internet at all in the last couple of months you notice the results of the genie PR the general data protection regulation that's from the new\nBut it affects websites everywhere you've seen that do you accept these cookies notices\nThat isn't direct response to the European Union union laws and the question is will our Congress enact similar laws ensuring that companies often end users to collect information about them and their data privacy now I I Would argue that most listeners and really even probably you and I\nDon't fully understand what that warning message means we click it to get to the content we're looking at we assume that every website is going to be tracking our behavior and tracking some information about us the question is how much\nHow honest and open and transparent are they about that and do they give the give us as the new regulations require\nThe ability to take our information out of there and say I no longer trust you I no longer wanting attracting my data cleans delete it and\nDo the company's then follow suit it's a bit of a complicated issue and its convention and seeing what if anything Congress can agree on to propose to the American people that say hey this is how we're going to protect your data but I think even before any of that happens bars it's important that we take an active role in protecting our own private\nDo you suppose that any of these ... companies like Google and Facebook\nMight say to you we understand that some of you have particular data concerns I worry about that a bit Brian because of the nature of what I Do for a living and some of the crazy people that have occasionally come after me or my family um but frankly that's been the ebb tide for a while so I'm I'm Glad for that but there were times where it was truly frightening so\nWould they ever offer somebody like me well you're going to have access to all those but you may pay a little bit more but will agree not to grab your date at all because you think that is that a you know\nA private company would say let's do things that meet the needs of our consumers some of them don't care if you're gather data other people care intensely why not why not have the private company meet that need by saying yeah you can have access but if we're not getting your data we need to pay for some other way\nAnd getting our data I mean it's important to point out that the reason these companies want your data is because that's where the money is Facebook can target more effective ads to you if they know a little bit of pouch or in some cases a lot about you and so you're saying large you know hey I Want to pay ten bucks a month for Facebook\nTo have a privacy or a free version of attracting free version if you will so that you can get all the content of Facebook but to contribute to pitch in to the kitty for example you're willing to pay a monthly subscription and I think as these rules and regulations get rolled out and people have a more in depth conversation about privacy some business are gonna have\nTo take a look at that now the Facebook so the Google's of the world could probably afford to have a few million users to opt out of tracking with no big deal but if you're a small start up and that's how you're making your money based on the data and targeting advertisement\nYou may be looking for another option and frankly I Would welcome that it puts a service like Facebook that I use and and they can provide a level of service maybe a phone number I can call when there's a problem\nOption and frankly I Would welcome that if it's a service like Facebook that I use and and they can provide a level of service maybe a phone number I can call when there's a problem I I'd probably be happy to pay nine ten bucks a month for something like that if the value proposition was there and I knew my data was here\nBy the way we had a tremendous little success peace with phase I mean we've had our troubles batteries for over the years but but when we hear this plan to do a broadcast from a University of publicly supported the college Republicans said\nCome down Lars and you'll speak to our group and you do your broadcast from here and we will uh we were celebrating the second amendment week\nI said I'd be happy to do it well the last minute the college shut it down because as you know I carry a gun everyday although for me to do that is completely legal it's within the law and the university has no power to stop me will the universities and threatened the students the ... they said we'll take away your funding for your college Republican club\nOr will will a sanction you use students maybe drawing you know pulled up in front of a disciplinary committee hearing all these things\nAnd in the past I never would have been able to do much to respond because like it or not when you do a broadcast you have to have permission to be on somebody's you know to use a room or whatever\nAnd and I plan to have you know as many kids wanted to stop buying and talk during breaks and that sort of thing\nWell that didn't happen because the university could denied the space could denied access to the Internet connections so I said to my producer let's go up and we'll do Facebook Live stream from the campus and we did exactly that and do you know that thing has had so many hits it's somewhere in the I think it's four hundred thousand plus on that piece of video where I just\nStood there in the ... on the on the campus in the student union and explain what had been done how the students were threatened how they were told you cannot invite this person to campus\nAnd how they were literally threatened with disciplined as ... as individual students and you can't do that to a young man or woman who's Nineteen or twenty say you may end your college career right here now because you invited somebody we don't like\nTo come to the campus and it got a tremendous response from around the whole country\nWell and and let's talk about Facebook Live and some of these other tools and you know we're talking about privacy and how we can pay for the how these companies can pay for these products everyone from you know think about Google mail and all of the products that they released largely for free well they're not for him because they're using your data to be able to sell advertising and that Facebook Live broadcast\nWas only possible because you opted into allowing some of your data demean shared advertisements to be targeting you\nAnd the four hundred thousand people that have needed that that video so you have on our on our instantly Facebook is where the audiences and for broadcasters like yourself and myself\nAre that's where we need to me and it's great that they find a way to pay for those even if that is with our privacy but he comes back to that we have to be concerned about our own privacy and there's no sense and waiting for Congress to decide what if anything they're going to do take an active role take it to that\nYep absolutely Brian thank you so much for the time\nAbout ... Brian ... you know happy Halloween to you as well that is Brian Westbrook you find what he writes had Brian Westbrook Dodd come on and tell you about zipper good of you know it's not smart job sites that overwhelm me with lots of resumes you know what is smart zip recruiter dot com slash large unlike the other job sites\nHas gone down like a percentage points in that same Pew study over the past ten years that's a lot\nNow there's a lot of people who are Christians but there are that's gone down quite a bit\nOkay so the the number leaving has we we now have eight percent who dropped out of Christianity\nThere was something like on the order of Seventy eight percent proclaiming themselves to be Christians and now as down around Seventy what is ... ... we\nHave now you know the nuns that the so called nuns which have atheists agnostic is which is are probably in their mostly a son that's like twenty seven percent\nYou're a philosopher what what causes people to turn from conventional route religion to religions are really have to be described as on the fringe\n[noise] well [noise] if if a a religion is not going to say it is true\nAnd their religion is only going to say it as one of many\nAnd that you have options people are going to say you know what maybe this religion isn't true maybe this religion is just one of many options and they're going to naturally go to some place that does say hey this is true these weapons are saying this is true and that Christianity is false and people are hungry\nFor this kind of certitude that ah that we're not provide\nAnd that Christianity is false and people are hungry for this kind of certitude that ah that we're not providing them frankly\nWell maybe they're right in in saying that has become perhaps in some ways more uncertain world or just from the standpoint and you tell me what you think of this doctor Briggs it used to be that we got the truth from three evening newscasts\nAnd radio and your local newspaper there's usually one or most big cities had gone from many down to one\nAnd so you you know if you saw a story and it was the same story in the evening news on the radio and in the newspaper you thought well I Know what's going on these days with the Internet\nAnd with all the multiplicity of sources which I enjoy uh because I like being able to track well you know this is one version of the story let me read for more and see if they all match up and see where the differences are\nBut that can also lead somebody and say well I don't even know what's true I sat down and write on the Internet research to particular news story or topic\nAnd and I got six different versions and they all seemed to be valid that could lead you to believe that nothing out there is certain\nI think that's true for a you know matters of news in day to day events and politics and the like but uh as far as religion goes here after a sort of metaphysical\nStarted to your after answering these big questions and you can go and read that there's you know differences of opinion and that's always been available for religion I think most people always understood that there were\nYou know the Hindus and ah and Mormons and Buddhists and all this kind of things so that was always there for people to explore if they wanted to\nAnd I think that this is probably at least in America or another reason people are fleeing Christianity is that it [noise]\nIt seemed it seemed to them to be more conservative you know we're sort of breaking a part of the country right now at least as far as the pain is goer bifurcated\nAnd a good reason that people are leaving is that the Christianity seems to say hey look we have these universal ancient\nTruth and if you want to be a Christian you need to hold of some of these is becoming distasteful to a lot of people who don't want to acknowledge those truth\nWell gosh you know I'll admit I have a dog um if I 'cause I'm a Christian but Dr Briggs I almost get more worried that the religions that go along and get along and say\nOh you can be a Catholic and still believe in abortion you can be a Christian and still you know in other words it's it's it's like ordering at a Chinese restaurant one from column a one from column B and if you don't want anything from column C you don't have to I mean if you're looking for ... to the church says well\nYou don't have to leave and everything we believe in to be able to be you know a Christian or a ... or you know or or a Muslim or whatever the Muslims are pretty strong or this is the way it you're going I understand they buy for occasions to\nUh primarily between uh you know Shia and Sunni but but do you think it's the lack of of religions taking a stance and saying this is what we actually stand for and if\nI think that's absolutely absolutely positively the largest contributing force Muslims are not a are increasing because of this reason I Know that there are some differences as you say\nBut even though sex or increasing and not just because of a you know increased birth rate there's lots of conversions being made because uh Muslims are willing to say this is right and there it is right this is wrong this is true this is\nMade because uh Muslims are willing to say this is right and there it is right this is wrong this is true this is false and they're in there and they're determined
