I don't view it'd be a monumental task I Would imagine but at what point do we need to start screening male or at least packages the same way that people get screened before they go on an airplane where where's that are ridiculous suggestion or physically impossible\nWell I don't know about the physical impossibility of doing it I think it's something that's come out of this case and I'm surprised that they don't do it more often I Know FedEx and UPS\nDe do some kind of screening and to try and determine what they're shipping but the U.S postal service handling billions of pieces of mail a year\nIt may be much more of a difficult task but you would think that if you're going to implement that type of procedure you would start so with packages and work your way back to potentially envelopes and or anthrax\nDetectors ... and that's exactly what I'm thinking of and I know that I fly I don't know a dozen times a year most of it for work but I Know that when I'm walking through the line and my my years being scanned that they're looking at a screen and the just\nI fly I don't know a dozen times a year most of it for work but I Know that when I'm walking through the line and my my years being scanned that they're looking at a screen and the to some extent that thing is color coded it makes me think that\nMay be an automated system could at least spot some of the more obvious ones because\nI you know I Know that some of this is a closely held piece of information but I Know just by looking at the system\nThat things show up differently on that screen depending on what kind of material they're looking at are they looking at ... or they're looking at mental are they looking at the inside of a laptop and what does a legitimate laptop battery looked like and what his laptop battery looked like and what does a piece of plastic pipe look like if it's filled with some kind of powder\nI mean it could be ... or it could be full of explosives and I would imagine in this day and age uh we've got such good technological tools\nThat you'd think you might be able to scan many thousands of packages and just have the computer said to say when you see one that ... that fits a certain set of criteria\nKicked that one side and then we'll take a closer look at it and then you might be able to do these packages\nIt's an excellent point and I'm surprised we don't do it already what came out of this case is that we don't do it to that proportion look at an airport when you when I go through the screener and no matter what line Iran it goes there something suspicious shows up in that package which calls for secondary screening it kicks it\nOut of the machine kicks it out of the conveyor belt to a second conveyor belt I don't know why we couldn't look to do that in the U.S postal service\nAnd you wouldn't necessarily have to do with the human beings sitting there slowly examining each one if you know that a computer never gets tired you know if his scanning looking for particular characteristics it never gets tired and never has an off dead him never had the day when you didn't get your second cup of coffee and the computers should and now I'm not saying that machines are everything\nBut if you need to scan hundreds of thousands of baggage is I don't know how you could do it unless you had an army of people saying they're looking at screens all day\nOr you wouldn't do it we don't do it at the airport we do is we have a screener\nWho is alerted by at a computer screen that there's something that calls for secondary screening at with this package\nAnd that's what kicks it out so if you're a package was delayed by my package was delayed by a day or so I wouldn't mind if it needed a secondary screening and therefore was put into separate line\nAnd had to then be done by a human or even the second machine to us to a third\nPoint where a human then looks at it because I think that the safety of our postal employees and the people who are delivering the mail and people where it's going into a male role in certain buildings around this country you know the safety of our people\nIn our citizens are paramount to law enforcement as well as everyone else in this country\nNicely said now tell me this what else have we missed and what else have we learned about this one that we ought to be doing differently if anything\nWell I I think what we learned is how well law enforcement can come upon someone who is looking to do us harm and\nHow quickly law enforcement agencies around this country this happen to be kudos to him why pay day the FBI and the joy terrorists task force and the postal inspectors but you know it it shows what law enforcement around this country\nAnd what cops do every single day and every single jurisdiction to keep our people safe and how quickly they'll find you if you plan to do an act\nOf terrorism in this country and threatened the people of any city or any jurisdiction the police will get you they will rest you a will spend the rest of your life in jail say Iraq is now looking at fifty eight years with just the ...\nDo they will rest you will spend the rest of your life in jail say is now looking at fifty eight years with just the five charges they've charged with today I think they'll add additional charges other things are failed\nIt will be a life sentence in a way even fifty eight years it's fifty six years is a life sentence for him and he deserves every single day of it if not the death penalty\nI absolutely agree one last thing in about forty seconds and that is do you believe based on what we know and I know you're not you know in the position that crime lab is do you think he intended for any of these to go up or merely to have devices that we're real old enough to really terrorize people\nMost of the Tea Party a protest ones that I went to and ones that I saw in other cities and in D.C on television they were incredibly civilized event whereas you you look at the average left wing event a good example of January of twenty Seventy\nThey were incredibly civilized event whereas you you look at the average left wing event a good example in January of twenty Seventeen after Donald Trump's inauguration the crazy women's march ... you know the fact is\nThere's nothing wrong with women saying we want to be treated equally and equitably okay it's already in the law ... would you like and we'd like to burn some limousines we'd like to stage a protest in which people have their safety threatened and that causes a lot of trouble and gets us on TV I think that's what's crazy\n[noise] although I mentioned the Madonna telling telling us fill us support Trump and that's not black oh\nIs often fantasize dreamed of blowing up the White House that's when Madonna said and that is wacko as well and yet you know\nThat if a Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's adult there is a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in it a long time and I love the craft I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI Am proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become because we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off\nAnd the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories\nIs that when I went from being a reporter on both television or radio to being a talk show host there were folks I'd run into both strangers in people I knew who say\nYou're a conservative and I said yeah I'm a conservative ... well I never knew that and I said what did you think I was a wife you worked on television I thought you were a liberal I said well clearly I kept my opinion out of my reporting which is what reporters are supposed to do the other thing that's dangerous to the entire profession\nIs if you tell people when we cover stories were going to cover them in a double standard\nAt ... in other words if one group of people says something or does something we're going to tell this kind of story but if somebody else from the other side does precisely the same thing or something so similar there is nearly identical we're going to treat the story entirely differently\nI mean constantly I look up at these two screens in my studio one on Fox on it one was CNN on a big big screen TVs\nAnd I and I look at them and I see them saying with no proof Donald Trump says X or y or Z\nAnd I thought during the entire eight years of Obama I never once saw them say with no proof whatsoever Brock Obama today claimed to blah blah blah and I thought the but there ... there were plenty of times I mean when when when one bronco Obama was asked Juno that the IRS\nHas been going out and denying a conservative groups free speech rights by denying their application for tax free status all he had no clue and he said oh the first I knew about it was when I saw it on the news and I thought\nThat at a bold faced lie you can't make us you can't tell us on one hand you're a Harvard educated lawyer and your ... according to your fans one of the smartest guys on the planet and then turn around and say no I was completely clueless\nAs ... and I made the point of the time the president of the United states should be arguably one of the best in foreign people on the planet he has platoon of people around him from all these different agencies whose entire job is to gather every important piece of data in the world even stuff that that secret\nAnd then to boil it down to just what\nIs together every important piece of data in the world even stuff that the secret\nAnd then to boil it down to just what the president needs to know and say Mr President we are going to tell you what's going on in Turkey or what's going on in Iran we're going to tell you what's going on in Iowa and they boil it all down and they feed it to him and say this is what you need to know how\nCould a guy who's so well informed claim to be so ignorant of what was going on and the only answer is\nHe was lying and yet I never saw CNN or MSNBC or any of the rest of those ... or the New York times say\nThe president claimed without any sense of credibility\nThat he had no idea what was going on in the ... J during fast and furious or the IRS during a the the cheating on conservative groups he had no idea that the EPA without taking actions that would lead to the release of toxic contaminants into the Animas River he had an in other words\nAccording to Morocco Obama bronco bomber was arguably the single most clueless president in American history if you believed his denial of that\nThat's what's going on in any case at least the man is in custody he has been charged with crimes\nThat give convicted will put him away Caesar's say they'll put them away for the rest of his natural life\nAnd

about Donald Trump\nIs it while you didn't hear Brock Obama criticized people from his own party very much at all in fact I Can't think of a very good example where Morocco bomber or Bill Clinton\nOr or Jimmy Carter or any of the other Democrats who have served as president of the United states chose to criticize their own party\nBut I Do see them you know criticized the opposition party Donald Trump criticizes anyone that he disagrees with and as far as I'm concerned that's a good feature in a president\nOur Twitter poll should President Trump held partially responsible for the bombs you

... dot com\nAnd\nWelcome back Mars why shouldn't show it's a pleasure to be with\nYou and I'm Glad to take your phone calls and emails on this First Amendment friday night\nBut I also want to talk to my friend Dr Henry Miller and you know him as a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute published in a lot of places both scholarly journals that are way beyond my ability to read and the popular press as well Dr Miller welcome back good to be with your laws\nSo we've got a lot of other threats in this world obviously today we've been spending a lot of time talking about the bomber and that sort of thing and I wanted to grab you on a couple of those things at the end of this interview but\nWould you mind talking about the fact that we see continued average to try to ban plastic here and banned plastic there\nAnd the fact is I thought plastics has actually been one of the things we had done that actually made our lives we take it for granted but it's made our lives a whole lot safer from a lot of the threats that human beings have faced literally for thousands of years and plastic as the way we've escape from some of those threats\nOh absolutely and in fact uh as I wrote this article about it go fundamentalists attacks on plastics or I thought back to the Nineteen sixty seven film the graduate\nUh and you may remember that uh Dustin Hoffman plays the title role and she said his graduation party and I'm a guy comes up to him and says uh then I have one works for you\n... as a and a half century since then plastics have really revolutionized are so many industries uh and\nUh you know when I was training and and medicine we had just converted from glass bottles for intervening solutions and blood to plastic bottles and it was such a remarkable improvement they store better if they keep better they're safer because inevitably glass bottles which\nWould be dropped a and the ... glass on the floor and you would you would never get\nPollution quote unquote and um we continue to have a a tax on various plastic ... things that make plastics pliable and and more convenient like this ... BPA\nUm and the attacks just go on and on and on a a base with without much basis um and without thinking about it carefully and considering the science\nWell and I thought about that too because I Know a lot of people say well you know there's food safety but I buy my food in tin cans what a lot of people may not appreciate is those so called tin cans with ... which have very little pin in them are actually lined with as you said BPA and other kinds of things that make\nA tin can a whole lot more save for containing any kind of food you buy the grocery store and and and I and the plastics\nYou know doc I think about the plastics where products you know including a lot of food products are package sometimes dramatically sealed and you know the air taken out or some other kind of gas put in so that so that everything last\nLonger and or is or is better better protected against the kind of common contamination they could literally take your live a few decades ago\nYou're you're absolutely right and you you bring up\nA broader point which is that you have to you have to do with their risk analysis folks called comparative risk assessment you have to ask if you if you eliminate a product day what are you a substitute for what are you left with\nA and so we're seeing that in California because there's a a a state senator who keeps introducing bills to ban Styrofoam containers from restaurants for takeout and for a for hot beverages or cold averages and uh\nIt seems popular because we see a Styrofoam trash around but the alternative of course is paper a which is more a consumptive of oil and electricity interestingly um\nBy the way I Want people to take note of that and the fact that they say well there's a ... I remember the McDonald's Styrofoam clam shells they'd put hamburgers and because it both insulated and kept the juice worried belong and they said well you have to get rid of these because they don't degrading the landfill and when I went on research in a long time ago\nI had people say well we're going to replace them with plastic coded paper oh how does that'd be great and they said well it doesn't quite last as long in the landfill it it may be the Styrofoam would degrade over a you know hundreds of years and the paper will degrade over fewer hundreds of years am I right about those numbers are you are my aunt or\nDo you are absolutely right that the the other thing is that a police Styron\nA generates less waste water and also occupies less space in the landfill and the other thing is that we have we now have\nBacteria that will degrade\nA Styrofoam and and other plastics in the landfill so you know that this that these objections these attempts to ban things or just not well founded and well thought out so which is typical of what we see about the anti corporate anti technology but equal fundamentalist\nHey I Want to ask you about something else because about about an hour ago I was talking to a guest a who's a former police detective we're talking about the bomber you know the bombs that went through the males and he said well what he ... he thought it was interesting that we found out he's a he was a ... a retired top investigator for New York city's police department\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about\nAnd he said we found out the postal service has things like this going through it and we don't even know it and I thought and we're always hearing about other kinds of contraband whether it's illegal drugs from Asia or we're seeing a stuff come through that it's\nIt's a marijuana gets shipped that way and if states haven't decided to legalize it it shouldn't be ship and I asked him\nWe had this technology we see at the airport and I you know while I don't know all the particulars of it I Know that when they watch your bag with computers and cell phones and this and batteries and all that go through\nThey know what color the screen is supposed to be and they know what colors indicate it may be some kind of contraband whether it's a fluid liquid or possibly explosive\nYou know I don't know what color explosive comes up as because I Would imagine I haven't been through the TSA line when somebody whose putting explosives through but my understanding is the color coding helps them spot those things pull him aside and do some more examination and I said\nIf you wanted to scan hundreds of thousands of uh packages the postal service carries\nCould we do that and could we say to a computer\nWhen a certain kind of material or what appears to be that kind of material comes through you know as we X ray could we X ray\nYou know say hundreds or thousands of packages by running them through a computer controlled line and then when it sees a box that they may not be sure it's contraband or explosive or whatever it kicks set aside and and let somebody else take a closer look at it\nThat's all the technology that did within our grasp isn't it\nIt it it is and with artificial intelligence or the system can actually learn what it needs to reject and ... in red flag and pass all uh in fact it's my understanding that checked\nBaggage is a analyze that way as well as the the the baggage that you put put on a conveyor belt yourself\nSo we could we could literally said of the postal service I Know they they feel like they're strangers doing the job they do now but they're losing first class mail but why don't we make sure that this stuff that's going through the post office gets scanned by that same kind of thing I think the public would be all for it\nYeah I think we could certainly do that for packages a you know flat flat letters a could probably sail through and then maybe do it just for packages that's a very good idea laws\nWell I just it just struck me that if that's within our grasp but I'm the same guy who wants to see a chicken irradiated before I did get sent to the supermarket suing kill all the salmonella or the other bacteria\nOr the ... that's on the exterior of it is it isn't a cure all but it was ... a lot of the contamination and probably for lettuce and salads because it seems like every other week I'm hearing about some other kinds of solid product that's making people sick and I keep thinking it radiation good solve that but\nHere Joe I thought you were keeping most of the nuts in Virginia and the purple part of the state around Richmond is don't you try and keep them confined up there\nAnd try to at least get them elected to office and then they can do crazy things like you know go ...\nOn a board member from a jails to try to get you know our catch and release program to complete it at our local jail but you know aside from those nuts um yeah we we are short a few nuts in this town\nAnd I and cross for ... Virginia and the mid Atlantic is is seeing this for quite a bit of what they are in the are coming to the side of the road\nSo maybe more hunting ... yeah I mean you get ... I went archery hunting for the first time this year I've been ... modern rifle before that\nAnd I wouldn't want to shoot a rifle in places is crowded with humanity is the commonwealth is but I wouldn't mind going back and trying to put an arrow in a beer or two but it is you say that's been restricted as well\nYeah and and with the national park a running along skyline drive a there's so much protected area\nWhere it's very restricted um the ... you know be survival is they know where it's safe they know where the family is you know this family grows larger and larger and larger uh it uh\nIt's just going to keep you know re multiplying itself uh so I think you know good management of her you're a hunter you understand that probably the best you know natural is our hunters because they don't want to over ... because then they have no\nReal meat for next year if they hunt the herd down to nothing and uh and and that's where it is is of course it feeds\nThe or the left wing green ease the this idea that we're over growing despite the fact that we have in eighty five percent of our arable land is in protection in one way shape or form and our property the costs are going through the roof so we can't even afford to live around here so I don't know how the\nIs in protection in one way shape or form in our property costs are going through the roof so we can't even afford to live around here so I don't know how they can say we're over developed but\nI mean I I just wonder uh gosh how do you solve this have you again on a more a governor Northam that's your your democratic\nAh he ... he probably believes a welfare programs all the ... seemed to do that as he thought about bringing in large trucks full of nuts I mean not for a antifa rally but a large truck full of nuts to maybe feed the bears so so they're not wandering around on the highways\nTrue story he just delivered six million taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood and\nSeveral hospitals for\nBirth control amongst poor women a Sunday remarkable you liked the case that broad Kerry bus before the Supreme Court ah for you know a albeit now technologically possible to have temporary sterilization\nOr that might be something that could do I don't know what the clinics are for the bears but I'm sure that would probably be the humanitarian way is to\nProvide you know perhaps abortions too the bears if they're overpopulating\nI gotta tell using is crazy in the commonwealth come out west out here you've got environmental groups who want to do to to bowl like Asian on here\nBecause they can't get that does to reliably take their pill every morning on the ... so I'm not kidding they wanted they they want to ... the ... the does the females and and then ... on them\nSo they get like gosh yeah so they can go and get busy and and the problem is is I understand is that they do they actually have a bad effect on this because there is a natural process investors that if you let it happen if you don't\nThen I guess it can actually make the does appear to be available all and I'm not kidding about this I don't know they actually make the does appear available all year round instead of just during ones one specific season of let's get busy and and then that\nBrings in all the all the males and they've they've had that problem and I think in New York state in a couple of places that\nYou know I'm Sorry to hear that you have more of a nut problem because I I thought all that in flux from Richmond was causing enough I've been a problem to lose too\nAnd it's only a week and a half toll action day so\nHow's it going to come out I mean what what's the big one going on in the commonwealth right now\nOn the outs Dave Dave brat versus out at the Yale spanberger well he ...

I you know and I get to service the American dream Lars I mean I came from food stamps and I get to run for Congress I mean he gets to do this right what other country you know gives you an opportunity like that and then you know it's funny I'm Talking sort of normal\nYou know English ease right for Ginia southern boy let's have a good old time you know and let's go kick some butt and for her it's all about resist Trump G H Trump\nAnd anything he does she hates and she's very very clear about it and she might she might have Trump more than any other candidate in the country\nBoy that is that that's interesting it's interesting that you're up against somebody like that and that Virginia voters my embrace her\nWell I mean we just we had to pull this morning and and we knew that there was one of the ninth hole say we're tied and the other ones we've done pretty well\nBut it's been interesting that um there's certain sectors in my district you know Charlottesville and end up closer to northern Virginia I don't know if you know this large my district is bigger than New Jersey and parts of Delaware it's Twenty one counties I'm there seven hundred and thirty thousand people spread on this massive\nDistrict it looks like a dragon riding a scooter I'm that way that it's sort of gerrymandered into you know right now though we're probably about ten points ahead so we're feeling pretty comfortable but it's been a real slog\nNeeds a new candidate NO NAME id but I've had to learn my learning curve has been straight up but I got to tell you what right now we're feeling pretty good\nWell I Would imagine you would be you know I Would imagine that the folks and look the commonwealth has become more blue it's not quite blue eyed but it might be ... especially the northern end\nBut it but it's always struck me as a place that was really a freedom loving plays uh where where the people there for the most part I Want to you know a different kind of government than most of the the left coast or the right cause I'm stuck you're on the left goes surrounded by liberals\nBut I find that when you ask people about specific issues there are often more conservative than you might guess based on who gets elected to Congress\nI think it's who's coming into into the commonwealth you know we are genuine was the first comment but I'll tell you a large I'm Virginia born and raised right I I mean I was born in the bustling metropolis\nVirginia was the first comment but I'll tell you a large I'm Virginia born and raised right I I mean I was born in the bustling metropolis Damascus right and my dad lived down near Charlottesville and then put it in a county\nUm I've seen a huge change since in Virginia since you know I was a kid and yeah I was in the military went around the world but what I'm saying is that it seems that and I know this\nIt sounds like almost there is no common sense coalition left it's almost like there's this progressive and I made up this word ... where people saying that the ... I Can't I have always feared government\nOr even being in it and and supporting the constitution limited government has always been sort of where I'm always err on the side of liberty and when I see now is is that people seem to just want somebody to take care of them in a sort of scary\nThat that American Dream or that that individual is that we all\nThink is part of the fabric of our country the DNA of our constitution it seems that some people now saying that the government is there to help them or protect them and I think the government is usually there just to sort of um enforce equal misery amongst the populace and so I I'm just trying to get this liberty name back of this liberty same\nBack into this campaign but also back into the ... because it's it's where I was born and raised I Love this I Love this place Lars meadows I'm an optimist I Can't help it\nAnd I want to see you do well see I'm One of those ... I find there's it occurred to me the other day I was thinking most of those on the left or more about well let's do things naturally and let's say you know and all that I said look to me natural\nIs not a group of people who were directed by government they're individuals I mean for most of the history of human beings on this planet we've been self directed people and occasionally we organize into towns and villages or or larger communities like states and counties but but we do that\nTo you know to to say well we need some things done that can really be best done by a government agency and it's tough for individuals run a jail or a police force or or a military and thanks for your service but for those very same people who want things to be natural but the natural order of things I think is not to have\nHuman beings being told this is how you're going to live your life so I'm all about you pushing for liberty in Virginia as well uh what's your website so people can help you out with the campaign\nSearch Denver for Congress dot com and uh my Twitter is Denver the number of for a VA yeah if you go to my Twitter Denver for Congress or just to let you know Lars somebody stole

me grab this call from William down in Texas they William welcome to the Lars Larson Joe we're a little short for time let's get right to it what's on your mind denied\nThanks for I appreciate your time my question is the\nBiggest question that a lot of people ask is where does this evidence live from two thousand two for this gentleman\nA vet not even a gentleman but a person that created bombs and all of a sudden we have evidence from two thousand two why was this guy not on a watch list and then from that watch lists why it was not created\nHere that have a good long ...\nWay to why was this guy not on a watch list and then from that watch lists why wasn't not created he had a good\nLong ... ... a criminal record over all those years and ah and if you take a look and you're going to hear more but I think overnight\nBut he has a long list of things where he has either been arrested\nOr or convicted of various crimes and and that's where all that evidence comes from so that's the simple in short answer thank you for your pick for the call and\nThanks for listening in Texas you know I got to tell you your data is out there everywhere there are data breaches Facebook breaches big companies that are mining and sharing your info these are legitimate companies uh butchered risk and then you add in all the crux and scammers\nThe risk of ID theft is insane the best thing you can do is protect yourself in your family the way I did I switch to my id care for identity protection they are the best in the business\nAre lower taxes love the European countries and that made us incredibly well\nAt that time [noise] Swedish quality\nA lower tax is now the European countries and that made us incredibly well\nAt that time a Swedish politicians thought that we can do anything\nWell let's just sort of do things that feel nice and distribute money\nOr to our favorite coal suits and I'm just create a generous welfare state and that's what they did in the night and send them to the night and maybe the size\nOf the government double a tax increase the government is government regulate the economy and the labor markets\nAre but the result wasn't this sort of half the night these in society and that they that they intended it was more like in an\nEye on rent novel because our big companies are great entrepreneurs us I'm even are sort of direct dislike\nHim a bird and sports stars like the one board\nThey left sweet they stopped being productive in Sweden because the economy was suffocated was drowning in taxes and regulation or for that he is the seat of the economy they didn't create a single next job in the private sector\nA whole new jobs were created in the public sector and\nIn the end that made it impossible to fund the government of that size so it was a a long period of just generally are\nLagging behind other countries having lower growth rates than the others are but it also and in a terrible financial crisis in the early Nineteen nineties when\nOther ... countries didn't want to lend us money because it didn't seem like we were gonna survive for for a long time so for for a brief period of time the central bank country implement a\nAn interest rate at five hundred percent to defend the Swedish currency and the time even the social as soon as we said no it's not we can't do this we have to dismantle this experiment before his kill us\nI'm speaking with Johan Norbert who is a global economist she's with the kid to Institute is a senior fellow whose homes were free to choose media which has created Sweden lessons for America\nAnd you demonstrate how Sweden managed to pull itself back from the brink from five hundred percent interest rates and become the fourth most prosperous nation in the world was it easy to persuade people to leave behind those previous policies and go for something that was more free markets and lower taxes\nWell it wasn't and um\nYou know people don't want to give up things are but they get for free or so that took many years of 'em on discussion but what really changed the whole thing was\nWas this crisis that the physical moment and uh you know it's like that old saying that the prospect of being hang in the morning\nFocuses alliance you have to focus and concentrate on what's really important and for example our Social Security system and people wanted very generous pensions they had been prominence very generous pensions by our politicians but at this time when\nThe economy tanked\nAnd it seems like everything was going to collapse people realize that the alternative to reform wants the generous pensions the alternative to reform was a collapse of the whole social\nThe old telling it to to retool lawsuit generous pension built into it truthful will collapse of the whole Social Security system\nAnd in that case a ... it's a more secure\nAnd shows or better so the Social Democrats out of the central like I read that you're going to ... system and hatred use individual else as well um and they did and and it would create it\nNot because they wanted it because he'll turn it off and that was the case and in many areas as well eat realizing the economy opening up the regular Laiki\nAlso which I'm thinking that the businesses like because the ... they were also protected from you in\nThe cold it is because of this but he realized that it will be possible to fund or a public or a benefits unless we create the new businesses and many new jobs\nI'm speaking with Johan Norbert who has created Sweden lessons for America\nHe's a global economist
