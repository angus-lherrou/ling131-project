is doing a fantastic job at the United nations but you can imagine the personal strain that that takes on somebody who has teenage kids\nShe's now resigning but it's a happy departure I mean I'm sure that President Trump would have been glad to have her on the job a lot longer he\nActually called or to the White House because he said he had a big announcement about his friend or the United nations ambassador Nikki Haley\nAnd I sat there at the White House and the president said many great things about her and I think she deserves that\nBut what does that mean for the United states and what does

I I think that's\nAlmost certainly a big factor whether that's the entirety of it I don't know but the truth of the matter is\nThere is something else that we're aware of and that is that I Believe she was governor of the state of South Carolina for six years before that and that has you know at a at a time of being away and the stresses and so on so I I think that these are factors for\nAnybody um and whether that's the entirety of it\nI just don't know but uh we don't have any other public explanation at least at this point\nI Know that there were people who are raising questions about the way the president did it because he said I'm I'm holding an event it'll be at the White House I have some big news to announce about my great friend Nikki Haley\nI thought it was a classy way to give us send off to a really valuable former employee which may be every boss in America should take a lesson from that uh and and I would imagine that I Hope the president can get somebody almost as good as her to replace her\nBut that may be tough these days with the uh the the left and the never Trump or is making it making a job in the Trump Administration look as an unattractive as they possibly can make it look\n[noise] well that's for sure of one of the names that is being rooted about I have to say I'm I'm very apprehensive about and that is a a woman who formally was a H R McMaster's deputy at the national Security Council a moment by the name of dino Habib Powell\nAnd um she may or may not\nHave an easy time in the Senate I don't know but um you know one of the things that many of us are the buyer she usually about a decade Haley of course has been um the\nAbsolutely\nForthright and tenacious and well even courageous\nOf American interests in the United nations specifically in the middle east and most especially with respect to Israel and\nUnfortunately in my experience Dina it'd be Powell is not the Nikki Haley on any of those things and those are of course the president's policies so you'd expect her to chat with them but um she has been in\nAgain my experience I'm very much susceptible to the uh\nThe blender Schmitz shall we say of the Muslim Brotherhood and the United states she hails from Egypt originally um and I think this will be a terrible mistake so I Hope that's not the president's gonna wind up but uh you're right or is that anybody is going to face of the gods let\nA unless this is going to come up presumably after a ... on the election\nUh is going to face of the gods let a unless this is this going to come up presumably after a ... on the election and I'm perhaps the Democrats will be chastened a let's hope so\nWell tell me this one of the things I fail to understand Frank is when someone takes a job\nWorking for someone or some thing either an end to be a business and to to Europe or political entity\nA and says I really don't subscribe to the beliefs of this entity the policies are the charter of this group\nOr I don't know I'm going to work for a person and I don't agree with him but I'll take the job and then I'll deliberately and we've seen this happen in the Trump Administration a bunch of times the last two years just say I'm going to take the job and then I'm going to do whatever the heck I Want to do with the job no matter what the boss things\nWhy do people do that and why do they get away with it\n[noise]\nI think they do it because um they often have the hubris a to think that they know better than the president said appointed to that position they often or or even contemptuous\nOf the person who gave them a job and the question is as you say how do they get away with it um and unfortunately in the first year of the Trump Administration there was altogether too much at that\nUh I think probably at least in part because of the president was you know spending most of his\nOf waking hours trying to contend with the various investigations allegations and uh and other personnel challenges occasional crisis or two and a as a result you know folks who should have been called\nTo account words and it only incentivize them to do more and frankly a it serves as an example for others to do the same so that's a problem and I think it's gotten considerably better my sense of it at least as a with my palm bay state and John Bolton that the national Security Council or\nAt least in those parts of the of the national security arena\nThe that's the thing I've wondered about because frankly honestly there are some groups in the ACLU called me up and said will pay a pile of money to come down and be our press spokesman for the ACLU I'd say thank you very much know\nImmediately know I I don't fit I I Believe in civil liberties I don't believe in the way that they're doing it on the other hand there might be individuals that I Would say yes to quickly or no to quickly\nBut I Can't imagine going to work and promising to take a paycheck\nTo do a job intending to not do the job because I think and and intending if anything to undercut\nThe you know the the beliefs in the philosophy of the person I'm going to work for unless I sat down with him and said yeah I'll go to work for you but I Believe the way you been doing things is wrong\nAnd you can do much better if you do it my way and if your employer your prospective employers is why you're probably right we'll let you change the way we're doing things then you might take the job but deciding to deliberately torpedo your employers\nTo satisfy some other goal I I just do not under the I Can't wrap my head around it Frank\n... well ... and that this is why you know unfortunately we have a lot of swap creatures and very few Lars Larson [laughter] so we could we could use a lot more of you here I could tell you that and again it it I called it the phenomenon of the in subordinate subordinates um during president\nOr have you here I can tell you that and again it it I called it the phenomenon of the in subordinate subordinates um during President Trump's first year in office\nOr H R McMaster as I mentioned Dina pals old boss of was a prime example of this and you know I think we've talked about this before but just right off the ... the day he joined the national Security Council\nHe announced his staff that he did not approve of the use of the term radical Islamic terrorists\nWhich you may remember was something the president actually said repeatedly and come pain for office\nOn as a platform of what was going to be different about his administration from Obama's ... it was just one early indication that he was a bad choice and a mistake and I'm so grateful that he's gone and so pretty should have the John ... was selected as his replacement\n... I think Ambassador Bolton is the best and frankly [laughter]\nFrank I'm Talking to Frank Gabby from the center for security policy\nI think it'd be the height of dishonesty to walk in and tell an employer I'm going to go to work for you and not say by the way ms ... you're entirely wrong about radical Islamic terrorism and I plan to say so\nWill not accept the rights of the people who live right next to them to exist and continue to exist\nIt would be like having a neighbor who says on a regular basis Lars I'm planning that you're going to die soon uh it'd be tough to negotiate with somebody like that\nShouldn't we push back against that kind of thing and even be a little bit belligerent since all the you know warm fuzzy talk of the last Thirty years hasn't really brought the Palestinians anywhere even when Arafat was offered a uh a Ninety eight percent of what he wanted he said no\nHe wants the Jews are dead and how we ...\nI think that's a little bit more like a if your neighbor if you were living in your neighbor's backyard if that are going to give it back and then she do despite of being U.S foreign policy that you ought to uh so uh the Palestinians are far from perfect uh and I agree with you it Arafat that made a mistake in those negotiations but uh\nI think it's the Netanyahu government that is refusing to shape now are not Palestinians\nOr is that the is a real obstacle to peace there but I mean that that issue or is it is a hardly the most important one were value waiting Haley I think a or her policies are state makes on North Korea Syria which really seems to want us to try to overthrow aside\nOr which I think would bring a a messy chaos tried it and Iran are or where the biggest problems where\nYou know it's funny that you mentioned getting us into another war\nAs I recall bronco bomber ran as the anti war president and he ended up putting troops into Syria or without telling the public for a long long time he ended up putting troops a number of places he didn't get that well he got them all the way out of Iraq and then ended up putting about six or eight thousand back into Iraq\nBecause pulling out a while you know it it wasn't advised by a lot of the generals was what he did and then we ended up having to put troops ride back in there and and yet the constant drumbeat I heard before Trump was elected and after he was like does this guy is going to get us into a war\nIt seems to me that the previous president Barack Obama got us into more conflicts or put people in harm's way and more conflicts than this president has an this president\nHas actually figured out to get North Korea at least to come to the table and he's and he's taking a hard line with the Iranians which one is the more pro war President Trump or Obama\nWell I I'm not sure I I certainly growth or almost all of this is this notion that Obama date I Wish\nUh Obama hadn't a continued a lot of the war the inherited her to the war in Afghanistan are\nGone that's more deeply involved in Syria or helped overthrow the government of Libya I opposed all those things that thought they were mistakes are I think uh the Trump Administration has continued almost every or will they actually if you could every war they inherited\nA and I think they deserve some credit for for pursuing diplomacy with North Korea or by uh they've been a across the board I think a fairly electric but at the main thing is that you know we we have a bipartisan\nConsensus in this country or left and right as much as they are throw rocks at each other and decker tend to agree and all these things but I just said demonstrates that so I disagree with both sides and both parties presidents when they are advocate wars that I think are needless\nYou think that sometimes talking in a bed bitten a belligerent tone to people who've decided to be problematic in one way or another\nHer needless do you think that sometimes talking in a bit no belligerent tone to people who've decided to be problematic in one way or another is sometimes the best way to keep them from going too far rather than try to you know the nice warm fuzzy approach to them 'cause that never seems to work\nWe we do try the nice warm fuzzy approach a at times certainly uh the Trump Administration does certain countries a Saudi Arabia for example\nUh that are problematic uh I think a dirt of course there are times ... threatening a but at the the example that I mentioned doesn't bass or Haley doing it I thought were mistaken\nA week she threatened for example uh she said it was U.S policy that we would bombed the north Koreans if they had an ICBM then he cuts in ICBM that we can bomb them so I think you know if you're going to make threats they should be ones that you're prepared to act on it and that case it was freelancing and not a\nFollow any sort of broader policy that had been articulated\nAnd I think that that sort of empty plaster is is bad for us credibility and a reputation\nActually agree with you there as for the Israelis living in the backyard of the Palestinians professor one last thing in the last forty seconds when countries go to war on this planet isn't it generally the case that when the the boundaries are said when the hostility sees that they stay where they are until the two sides strike a peace correct\nFor\nOkay I'll like North Korea and South Korea we don't do officially haven't into that war so we have this DMZ down the middle and and that's where it stays until you strike a peace the Israelis that people have made war on the Israelis and they took property or in those conflicts and they hang on to wait until somebody's willing to strike a peace which they can do anytime they want\nAnd which they have vastly resisted being willing to do that kind of thing and professor Friedman I've always appreciate your insight even when we don't agree on saying thank you very much you're listening to Lars Larson

busy up by the way during the U.S Senate debate in Indiana yesterday\nOr the folks at Reuters which is not a bad news organization they're not as far to the left as the Associated Press they say it was difficult at times to tell which candidate was the Democrat and which one was the Republican as they both routinely cited their support of president Donald Trump's agenda\nIf you live in a liberal state like high do I live in the state of Washington\nThat must be wonderful to be in a state where Democrats and Republicans want to say how much they support President Trump\nImagine being in a state that conservative\nOr Joe Donnelly a first term senator is trying to stave off a challenge from a Republican businessman Mike Braun and in doing so\nKeeping alive democratic hopes of taking

you know that's an end but it's peer pat and now when you have a passion for your country you love your country and when you say left leaning liberals try to destroy the country\nTrying to push the resistance movement so that America could no longer exist the way we know we have to stop this foolishness we're not gonna know we're not going to have a country and so that's why we just talk about what we talk about\nI'm Talking to a dime and she'll be Internet giants Asians and I was just sharing with my audience this outrageous statement by Hillary Clinton who I guess things she's still a

and what did they do for this country\nHide deficit unemployment rate it it was out of the the window they send jobs overseas and look at what they actually did for this country when they did have power do we want that again\nAnd Obama when he had to wait and\nFats and all that you ought to have a cold but it's about a nice day he had to work for the latest Hollywood he looked up top and how

Hollywood good way I Love the fact that you've done it and participate in this documentary 'cause I think I've loved documentaries forever I used to make them for TV stations and you know none of mine have been as successful as I Know dummy crowds is going to be\nBut I thought it was a great way of getting a point across if you get people with a ten second attention span to sit down and watch it\nI Believe that people laugh is saying they were telling people to pay attention to us right now we've been we've been bamboozled but alas\nThey claim that they want this is that the Americans even if you're truly want this assessed America's why did you come to the table for tax cuts America would have been successfully\nGuinea more money in their pockets you cut to the table and things we want to

pro athletes improve their daily performance through the proven quality sleep it delivers my sleeve number setting sixty five\nA big corporations I mean I I can talk to our career fairs and say that we ... we co host of roughly a hundred and fifty of those a year all over the country we do some online these are big corporations are that are looking to recruit the highest level of talent you know from the veteran pool so they do recognize it\nThey also recognize the value\nOf disabled veterans and what they also bring to the workforce so I think it's out there\nUh but we do struggle with the fact that the unemployed as unemployment goes down and and everybody's thrilled about where the rate is right now and that's great were behind that one hundred percent but the overwhelming majority of those that we deal with on a direct bases are are not\nUnemployed underemployed and in some cases over employed\nJeff here's the thing we hear about discrimination in the workplace all the time\nAnd yet this is one of the few places were an employer could correct me if I'm wrong literally discriminate in favor an employer well I think Wal Mart did this not long ago said we're going to hire ten thousand votes and if they were effectively saying to everyone else yeah we're going to hire them first that the law allows them to do that\nTo say we're going to hire vets were going to give preference to vets I Know there are a lot of government jobs that give preference to vets and then you take into account the fact that a veteran of the who's done service is likely in some cases more finished the job kind of person to begin with whether it's a man or woman\nAnd then if you factor in the Americans with disabilities\nSome cases more finish the job kind of person to begin with whether it's a man or woman\nAnd then if you factor in the Americans with Disabilities Act that says you legally have to accommodate people's disabilities you think that the veteran would be in the cat bird seed for getting jobs that are available that they want to pursue the careers they want to do am I missing something or because you said that the surveys show that\nNot quite two thirds more certainly more than half of all veterans are worried that when they go out in the workplace if they're disabled they're going to face discrimination\nI Would hope they'd see not only employer saying we will follow the ADA and accommodate your disability but oh by the way you're a veteran we want to hire you even more than we want to hire the average applicant is that not happening\nUh I I think what you know with a statistic that that comes from a survey that we had you know that we had done and yeah we we were a little bit taken back by the fact that fifty seven percent of those surveyed younger veterans\nYou know fear discrimination in other words um they understand the position that they're in a boat when they come back and they want to maybe they want to join a police force so they don't want to disclose a particular disability uh because I think a lot of it really comes from the stigma that\nYou know you don't do that over the years that was taboo to do that you kind of keep that thing to yourself um where in fact I Believe where we are today in society is exactly as you put it companies are seeking those individuals again because of the fact that they have\nNo disability um you know one of the things that that we particularly uh when we started interacting with companies on a regular daily basis [noise]\nEspecially the multitude of them at career fairs is the fact that there was so much\nAnd and still so much work to do on the education front of educating employers on what a disability is\nHowever to the point the the companies are doing everything they can and creating a really really great opportunities for veterans now we got to get the veterans to understand that hey\nYou need to disclose that when it's proper to disclose it uh companies want to hire you because of it because their tax incentives for them financial incentives for them to hire you\nAnd it just trying to get both of them and bridge that gap that's where that you know our our ... guide to hiring and retaining veterans with a disability is is really that we've released this month as hopefully going to help on both sides at the table with that\nJob working folks find these resources on line and and I would encourage people if you got a veteran your family or your circle of friends go out and say hey you looked at this thing you especially if you know somebody who is an already in his dream her ... his dream job or her dream job say have you looked at this this can help you get where you want to go\nSure ah so I'll I'll divide that into a boat or the same resource and that's on

cakes UGA\n[noise] honestly provocative largely says welcome back\nTo Lars Larson show it's a pleasure to be with you invited to take your phone calls and\nEmails you know we talk a lot about civil rights on this program but you know that I Love the naysayers and there is no naysayers that I Love more than my buddy ... Juan Williams we'd like to call and Conrad but you see 'em on Fox News you read his columns\nAnd now he's got a brand new book out that I just I looked at the title of this and I thought one I got to talk to you\nThe title is get this what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on so\nAnd all this and I bought one I got to talk to you the title is get this what the hell do you have to lose Trump's more on civil rights one welcome to the program\nAlways a pleasure large thanks for having me on to talk about the book\nIt is a pleasure to have you on to talk about this book so I Want you to start with what is the biggest thing that Donald Trump is done to try to adversely affect the civil rights of Americans\nOh I Would guess number one would be that voters depression a effort you know they said oh it was about voter fraud we're going to start a convention I think his his feelings were hurt the Hillary Clinton beat him in the popular vote by three million so he said that that didn't happen fake nose\nOr actually it was voter fraud and so he got Chris cold back from Kansas to come and they're going to start a commission\nWell guess what they couldn't find anything but they allow state legislatures to go on in terms of closing polling places then minority areas uh increase requirements for voter id changing the time for voting I think I think he doesn't think that a minority is going to vote Republican I think that's the issue\nBook one I don't see that as voter suppression I Want him to check and make sure that every ... every one of the cast a ballot\nIs an American citizen entitled to cast a ballot and in fact in the two years since the sixteen election you and I disagreed on\nA in those two years we've seen people actually prosecuted for voting in ... from voting without having any right to do it we've seen it in Pennsylvania we've seen it in Texas and other places and I honestly don't think that election authorities many of whom are Democrats and liberal stage really care whether people vote illegally are not\nHere's the reality there is no one there is no major I mean you might find one instance here one instance there\nAt one point they thought they had something up in New England in some states if they do college kids were voting here and they actually are from other areas\nEven though they're going to college with and they ... oh no the state law allows college students to vote so this is what happened and this is why they had this ban that commission 'cause it was based on a big fat nothing but you know I think your initial question large is very intriguing what actually\nHas Trump done that were damaged civil rights in this country yeah I don't think we should ban this conversation much farther without saying his rhetoric is the way he talks\nHas been absolutely divisive including the title of this book because it comes from his language what the hell do you have to look at him and he's talking to an all white audience at by a them and they all Michigan and he's as many people reported as if he was saying\nOh to the black community your neighborhoods are so poor you don't have jobs\nLook at the poor quality of your schools why do you vote for Democrats why not vote for me that all Trump great question well and I think the first of all this he's not talking to the black community he was talking to the white community about the black community and I think he was saying those people over there\nAre so broken so dysfunctional fill with cats and violence and I Donald Trump will stand in the breach like a hero and I won't be a snowflake I Want to call 'em out and I'm going to keep them away they all muggy they won't take your dad's I thought my gosh he is absolutely demonizing the black\nAnd how did you I I'm just confused as to\nHow you read black community into that I think what he was saying was you voted for conventional Republicans before and you didn't get what you wanted you voted for conventional Democrats before and Brock Obama I think most of the black community has conceded that he didn't really deliver much for them what do you have to lose votes for me\nAnd they did it and by the way one I'll just point this out\nDonald Trump has brought black unemployment to its lowest level in ...\nSee and they did it and by the way one I'll just point this out\nDonald Trump is brought black unemployment to its lowest level in recorded history and ... and the number of new black businesses in the last two years almost two years of the Trump Administration because of the changes regulation because of the boosted economy\nThe percentage of new black businesses up by four hundred percent nationwide now those two things have a dramatic effect on the positive nature of black employment and black entrepreneurship that's a good thing right\nWell if the numbers are right that's a very good thing because I think the primary accomplishment of the U.S civil rights movement you know going back to the Nineteen fifties I'd say if you start with fifty four and ground going forward to\nThe passage of a civil rights back and fix the foreign by the way the book is structured on the basis of the provisions of the civil rights act looking at\nVoting rights housing education and the like employment law um but here's the reality Everytime President Trump calls a black woman a dog or says a black people have extraordinarily low intelligence I think that's what he said about Maxine Waters the Democratic\nCritical or ... I Would agree Maxine Waters does have extraordinarily low intelligence but if you think that's very literally is mainly ... Juan let me just finish our point here is\nGoing on about you know a LeBron James is so down me makes Don Lemon look smart and Don Lemon is done and of course you know his divisive rhetoric was the start of his political profile because he was in about a thing for our Obama's not an American totally fraudulently and he continued even after he'd been proven wrong\nAnd then he comes and says well anytime anybody says that you have a problem with race Mr ... he says look at the low unemployment rate and without saying oh that low unemployment rate Ninety percent of it is attributable to thank you Obama\nIt's only one percent since he's been in office and the black unemployment rate remains twice the white unemployment rate with him doing nothing to try to correct\nWell you want you want to correct result in this case I think that rising tide of the entire economy is going to lift all boats but does that\nMean one that you're telling me that if I go on the air and criticized Chuck Schumer I'm not being a racist ... truck is about as wide as you can get but he's also a Democrat but if I criticize Maxine Waters or Sheila Jackson Lee who just had a staff member arrested for you know some crimes that they committed involving the public's information\nThat if I criticize Sheila Jackson Lee I'm a racist because Sheila Jackson Lee is black\nAnd might not allowed to print is the president not allowed to criticize black people for fear of being labeled a racist or should all Americans be subject to criticism especially when they serve in high office\nYou know you're talking to somebody who's at heart Lars and you know me well you're my friend but you know that I came up as a journalist reporter like a ... a ... a street the ink stained reporter\nSo they're not my whole spirit is about holding powerful people accountable and telling people what a powerful what\nThe establishment is doing in this country and trying to get them to act right so that's me so you can criticize anybody of any color any gender any ethnicity nationality that you want\nBut to me when you do things like say\nGood people find people are marching when they are Nazis white supremacists and one of them kills people and they're standing outside a synagogue with tiki torches an automatic weapon than ours I think you don't understand the history of humanity much less the history of the un I Wanna\nOr just an automatic weapon than ours I think you don't understand the history of humanity much less the history of the un I\nWanna I criticize those people I don't hesitate to criticize them but I also criticized\nThe black Panthers who stood out in front of the uh ... Pennsylvania polling ... and ... when you're being\nNow you're being racist because you're criticizing the black Panthers no I'll criticize anyone who tries to keep Americans from voting but I don't think Donald\nIs trying to keep people from voting I think he's saying there are reasons to suspect that our voting system is flawed a theory that Democrats are agree with if you bring Russians into the picture and then as soon as you take Russians out of the picture and that seems to have fallen apart they say well now you can't criticize ... whether or not our voting system\nIs subject to possible fraud\nBut I'm saying on the ground the bigger issue right now is making sure that Americans can exercise their constitutional rights of all we want more people participating in our election system we want more confidence at a time when the institutions in this country especially the institutions of government are such\nYou're talking about voter id yeah well I'm Talking about four or are people who are\nYou're talking about voter id yeah well I'm Talking about for a for people who are getting a car like a license to dry\nOut and and I'm a million a million people in California who are illegal aliens have driver's licenses and their automatic voter registration well they're not ... and I\nBoth legally large legal you guys are making stuff up on the ... thing\nYou can't shoot at heroin legally either but it gets done a lot in the United states of America\nAnyway look I think the reason I met I brought up guns was that I Am someone who lives in big cities I'm not a hunter I Am threatened by people with\nGuns didn't have one yeah see that's your response but I look at all the murders look at all the mass murders look at what goes on in schools when people get these guns that so willy nilly is amassing on we are not protecting ourselves or our children\nI Want to ask you a theoretical question this goes to a civil right in his book is called what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights if you were to arm\nAny of the people in the great city of Chicago who are law abiding citizens if you arm them with guns legally lawfully the ones who want to be armed what do you suppose that happened to crime in the famous murder capital of America Chicago Illinois\nIf there were more guys they'd be more death\nNo more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens\nYou want and you would think arm everybody get the candidate Gardner is done\nIs they've never had that won all ... although if they can shoot well I plan to have my ... I plan to have my granddaughter shooting under adults or even by kindergarten do you think that's a good goal you should do it for your ...\nYeah I don't want her killing her friends hurt and I don't\nWant to say like large under adult supervision now yeah other than voting where do you think that Donald Trump is gone to war on civil rights let's talk about immigration to well we have time\nBut you want to talk about immigration ask me a question but I was going to cause the earth or going ahead and we're doing we're else have you\nGone to war on civil rights we talked about that divisive rhetoric we talked about distorting the reality of the black community focuses on the twenty percent that live in poverty disproportionately young people it's a very difficult situation link I think a lot of the history of this country beginning slavery but coming over to\nLegal segregation and continuing bias and bad schools that are so that is a problem but he ignores the forty percent of black America that earns between thirty five and a hundred thousand you ignore the additional twelve percent earns between a hundred two hundred\nThese are people who are get up everyday Lars and in the Lars Larson conservative traditions go to work work hard drive to get ahead in the face of continue racial bias in this country\nThis has to be celebrated I Would think conservatives would say wow look at people who had some difficulties faced discrimination and yet still believe in the ninth grade American Dream and believe in capitalism still a huge gap in terms of wealth between black and white America\nBut if that Donald Trump he doesn't eat it happened to the idea of what amazing accomplishment you can't send it to all those people are scary and I\nDid he ever saved them out do not hold on hold on wait we listen when I'm gonna tell you something I have to I don't think he's ignoring them at all in fact\nIf anything he celebrates the success of black Americans and and what is emblematic of that is the most recent public opinion polls you know these national polls that are done say that black voters support for Donald Trump has gone up it's actually higher now than what Mitt Romney had\nAnd Mitt Romney did not have a great number of black Americans supporting him\nDonald Trump has gone up it's actually higher now than what Mitt Romney had and Mitt Romney did not have a great number of black Americans supporting him neither did John McCain delayed John McCain but Donald Trump has higher black voters support than either one of those two guys\nYou know if we want to look at poll\nI mean let's look at the reality of the vote twenty sixteen I think he got eight percent of the boat\nYou're talking about a poll that did not have a significant number of black people being pope participating the reality is right now two thirds of all American people of all colors think race relations in the country or worse\nIt's about the same number who say they don't approve of the way Donald Trump handles race and here's the most probably one because this is something I'm very I'm very well what does he even uses kind of language racist forty nine percent of Americans in a foxhole said Donald trumps of race so to me Lars it's like ignoring\nThe elephant in the room and saying you know what we don't want to talk about race we don't want to talk about the fact that this guy is so offensive on this issue so critical to our history into who we are because of becoming a more diverse country well racially diverse but they're a battle for and I don't know how we get around this as I said the polls are pretty clear\nIt's you know that poll about racism eleven percent of Republicans said he's a racist and that's what maybe the biggest puzzle to me maybe I should ask you\nHow can good people decide that you know it's just the court he does have a little problem with race and so you know what\nLet's just pay attention to how I don't want a land so that when we
