Obama wouldn't do it that way or the other thing though and let me ask you about this and then we'll get to the book\nAnd that is in the nineties when ... when Clinton saw that his agenda was not going uh well he he did some course correction and said this isn't working for us we need to do a few things differently that will the left to be smart enough to do that as they see that these tactics are not working to their to their advantage\nYou see your [noise] it's a it's an excellent question you're asking but I see it a little bit differently I don't think there is a left in America anymore either I think there is a progressive far left you know that has allied with\nTheir um enablers in the media and who has crushed liberal people crush them so you're not seeing moderate Democrats\nSay a word there was a recent study done it says eight percent of Americans large are far less people\nBut that's what you hear\nYou hear Bernie Sanders you hear canal heresy here Cory Booker you hear Elizabeth Warren\nYep you don't want to hear\nThe moderates are the Democratic side and they are afraid of the far left the moderate Democrats are afraid\nBecause they know the far left as the media megaphone and so there really isn't a well we'll all laugh learned its lesson because the far left will never stop\nThey want a fundamentally different America\nAnd the moderate labs afraid of them so they're just gonna keep not saying anything how many Democrats large did you hear\nStick up for the presumption of innocence and due process and the Kavanaugh situation\nI Am really can't think of a single one that did and I think I Will either not\nAnd I researched it I researched it\nI I had my staff\nFind me a Democrat and elected Democrat that sticking up for the presumption of innocence in America\nNow you know there are plenty of them but they wouldn't say it because they're afraid of meat too they're afraid of a Soros they're afraid of Schumer\nAnd so they say nothing\nMost talking about killing you have and I think independent Americans are getting that maybe they're not getting it the way I laid out for you but they're saying you know there's something wrong you know and I think that'll show up in three weeks and I ... I I Do believe in ... I Hope\nYou're right let's talk about killing the U.S as the hunt for the worst war criminal history\nOkay um the book is about evil and I wrote the book off\nKilling Patton which is a fantastic success and thank you for pointing out that the killing series though this is the eighth one the first seven\nHave Seventeen million copies in print the most successful non fiction book series of all time in the first six days out killing the ss sold a hundred and forty thousand copies\nSo there's something going on here and wanting to garden I write history in a way that is\nDown and we've always done that\nBut ... says about evil and my contention is that Americans many of us don't understand truly evil we don't we look away from it so a guy walks into a high school he shoots down a dozen kids kills 'em thousands of people are shot\nIn the city of Chicago by drug gangs clerics molest children those are all evil acts you know but many of us are kind of look away well just on the news they don't understand it there's evil all around them and perhaps the most able people ever walked the earth\nWere Hitler's henchmen the ss who were in the concentration camps\nAnd we tell their story out many of them got away because people like the red cross the American CIA elements of the Catholic Church help them help them get away can you believe it you know and then they had to be tracked down by very brave people because Odessa\nAnd notice it contains a two letters ss they murder you if you were looking for these people these ss or on the run Odessa would kill you\nEmployment law and EEOC you know equal Employment Opportunity commission that none of this stuff even matters because it wouldn't hold up for those standards which are the standards of government a government that you may want to you know someday be president of that government\nThat's right the Boston Globe dating back to two thousand and twelve has essentially served as Elizabeth Warren's press office they did this back into two thousand and twelve what she does she gives them exclusive access to family members exclusive access to documents\nAnd they run with her story line and they did it back in two thousand and twelve and they've done it multiple times in the last three to four months as she's getting ready to run so what the Boston Globe didn't do here is what a responsible news organization would do they would have first of all\nReviewed her actual DNA data not just their record someone she hired concluded\nThey would have taken that data to another genealogist to another scientists who familiar with DNA and whatever verified this person's funding there is no indication they did that they simply took off the shelf\nOr a report she commissioned and she obtained which even on its face is almost laughable that she might be one one thousand\nNative American based on a DNA database which doesn't even include Native Americans and it uh this is is really preposterous and the and the issue becomes why did she do this\nAnd we know the reason she did it she didn't claim to be Native American when she was a child she didn't claim to be Native American when she applied to college or law school it was only\nIn her mid to late thirties when she was climbing into law professor ladder from University of Texas all the way up to Harvard law school that she\nLifted herself as being Native American it was known she lifted herself for each Yossi filing purposes that way and lo and behold when she finally get tenure at Harvard law school essentially the top rung on the ladder\nYou can't go any higher than that uh she stopped reporting herself as Native Americans\nAnd you're good high right there at that point well now\nDo you see this creating a real problem for her because as much as I think she's been a punchline nachos for conservatives but even for the president of the United states I'm In now having dumped this additional piece of data is no well I can show there's one one thousand but now you have to believe me\nIt almost seems to me that there's going to make her more of a punch line they're ... from tourists are just so humid Donald Trump would promised a million dollars if you could prove to his Native American ought to send one one thousand and twenty fourth of a million dollars to Elizabeth Warren and say OK bet settled\nAnd the Cherokee Nation issued a statement late today\nComplaining and lambaste in car and saying quote Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage close quote and they then go on to say that you cannot use DNA as a test\nIt's demeaning to Native Americans there's a lot more to tribal membership in tribal inclusion than DNA and the DNA is totally inappropriate to use\nFor their purposes and they don't use it and so what she has done is she has created\nTo think she thought she was going to settle this problem instead she's make made herself laughing stock\nAnd two she is actually forced\nNative American and this is this an official tribal statement from the Cherokee Nation saying that she is undermining their interest by or continue\nContinued claims of tribal heritage so I think she's made her situation a lot worse than it was the question I've always had for her which is we know what happened here she tried to cheat sheet try to rig the system\nWhat is the personality problem that she has that she will not simply apologize and I get a lot of her supporters like a policies\nOkay it's kind of left wing politics and they're willing to excuse it but very few people I Believe actually believe her when she says these things that may be willing to use it but they like a pilot\nBut I don't think anybody believes and I think what she doesn't realize if people are laughing at her with her and what she has done here which is ludicrous DNA that she should have come out and said I had my DNA tested\nIt's such a ... minutes you'll\nFraction at at you know one one thousand you know I really never should have claimed it I didn't do this before but now I Do apologize to the Cherokee people and to other Native American it would have created a little bluster for the week or two but you know what it would have served as much better you know people have to ask why won't she just apologize\nAnd it's got to be an ego problem because professor Jacobson from a legal interaction\nAmericans win amazingly forgiving country one I've seen politicians have the guts to actually apologize she won't do it and sadly I think she's going to pay for it thank you

president of Americans for tax reform and I don't think anybody likes paying taxes but I pay when I'm legally required to pay\nGrover it won't surprise you that some of my listeners had been paying way too much attention to the New York times story about Donald Trump and his taxes and how much the state of his father pay in taxes because apparently uh\nHurricanes for decades have supported the idea of polishing the death tax that it's an unfair attack so you pay taxes several times you pay taxes when you are you saying that\nYou're stupid enough to die they want to take half so this is a tax most Americans have wanted to get rid of that for a long time the Republicans came close to getting out of it under Trump is still there are a little bit\nUh but what outrages me is that somebody in the IRS leak\nThis you know uh yeah somebody's tax structure uh I'm I'm kinda concerned that if we trust the IRS without personal data that air attacks as that for political reasons it might get shared a not quite sure what\nThe ... when that happens politically remember a Nixon after he lost a Kennedy was audited for the next eight years and both Obama and Clinton politicized the IRS I served on the conditions are to look at the IRS during the Clinton years I was a Republican appointee and\nUh I heard many conservative groups Heritage Foundation citizen against government waste other groups\nWere harassed by the IRS and I talked to my left of center friends to see if you know maybe they're going after all the the larger groups ... none of the left groups were a hit by that and I asked the head of the IRS who testified before our commission or as congressional presidential commission and I said look ah\nMy conservative friends are being harassed and gone after for no reason to come out on the left this is not happening\nWhat's going on they said no it's got to a very even handed a way we look at this I said well explain it to us and they said no it's a secret\nYou're not really that that was yeah that really you'll have to trust\nA and then a carry the uh then senator from Nebraska said okay we've really exhausted the subject of what this is talk about something else gives the Democrats other\nYou know I Know ... we've exhausted at all I in fact Grover I've told people on the air listeners they'll say well why didn't ... release his tax returns I said you know\nThere are people who would sooner share their home address with you or their cell phone number ... ... email address then they would tell you how much they make what their paycheck is and to know somebody is taxes you'd have to end up knowing not only how much they make but how much they take home and what they did duck\nLike Hillary Clinton famously deducting charitable donations of her husband bills underwear and things like that\nUm but let's talk about something a little more serious there is an analysis that you've done is president of Americans for tax reform about who actually pays the taxes and I think this may surprise a few people um who does pay the bulk of America's taxes right now\nWell on income tax is about three percent pay the top fifty percent um it's the top fifty percent pay almost a hundred percent of the income tax or it's extremely progressive\nUh and uh the number of people who are paying the taxes are shrinking a number now all Americans pay some taxes that's why\nA lower income people they they're particularly\nBadly hit by cigarette taxes their taxes property taxes sales taxes so nobody\nNobody goes to your life on skate the Democrats think they can tell people I'm going to make other people pay for it lower income people are smarter than that they know they have the taxes they pay and if they think about it they know that when the grocery store pay property taxes\nAt the grocery store or the grocery store doesn't have any money it doesn't get from customers and every tax dollar that a grocery store pays and property taxes\nAre in sales taxes in a income taxes to their workers that all come straight out of the customers a pocket so everybody gets hit but the idea that the rich are paying anything and they could pay more we actually I was just looking at church today United States has the most progressive of\nOverall tax structure of all the major uh companies countries more than Europe\nYou know all the countries should think of is very socialist and so on ours is very scared and we ought to be reducing taxes on every one set of playing this game about you know that person seems to have all ten fingers let's\nTake one that's how about you know not worrying about how everybody's doing just let's get taxes lower on everyone\nWell and rover ... you know nobody would run their own life this way when I see the numbers you have the the top fifty percent of taxpayers a top income earners Ninety seven percent of the bill and the other half pay three percent I I tell people imagined you go to dinner with ten family members\nAnd one night you decide to do something different you say let's have all the people at this table all your cousins or nephews or uncles or whatever will seat the five highest paycheck folks at one end of of a long table and we'll put the other five people at the other end of the table and then when the bill comes\nIf the bill I don't think you could feed you know ten people for a hundred dollars but let's say you could just make the map easy\nWhen bill comes for a hundred dollars the people at the rich under the table ping Ninety seven dollars and the other five people at the other end to pay three bucks can you imagine doing that to your family one night\nHow long would it take for probably ... at least one end the ... the wealthier end to object to that kind of arrangement\nHere since ... one of the things that's very important to the left is to constantly say\nThat a higher income people middle income people aren't paying their fair share this because you can say that somebody is the government can get more money for free out of nowhere a instead of understanding that that a higher income people pay a great deal of taxes as it is\nUm because the tax code is complicated and because they're trying to squeeze more and more money out there like to hide how much it's hitting you and where are\nThere are problems and that it's too complicated we should go to a lower and simpler\nTax structure uh I grew up in Massachusetts we had a flat rate 'em as it's five and a quarter a flat rate income tax in very liberal blue Democrat Massachusetts the idea that we should have graduated a progressive income tax which\nCarl Marx lights at night yeah I'm not sure I get a in Massachusetts five times the left has put on the ballot let's go to a progressive her graduate income tax like the federal one and five times Massachusetts says voted it down because they realize that if you divide\nThe taxpayers into different groups and they each pay different rates they'll get bogged wanted at times seven\nOne year they'll get a lower income people raise it then the middle of the upper and the back and forth at all constantly changing but always up for it you know but if it's a flat tax\nThan the Kennedy kids and your neighbors can although don't raise anybody's taxes\nI think that's a great way to go Grover Norquist is president of Americans are transferred from reform Grover things all the time by the way you know what's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes you know what he was smart zip recruiter dot coms\nIt's separate cutter doesn't wait for the candidates to find you zip recruiter finds them for you it's powerful matching technology scans thousands of resumes identifies the folks with the right skills education and experience for your job and then actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast\nNo more sorting through the wrong resumes no more waiting for the right candidates to apply it's no wonder zipper critter is rated number one by employers in the United states that rating\nTour western advanced economy\nAnd then along comes Trump and it ... it was amazing to me it is it wasn't even just the new policies the deregulation of cutting the red tape and eventually the tax cut it was the expectation that no longer would you have the federal government\nPiling regulation upon regulation on American business things like the clean Power Plan and so you see this manufacturing boom\nStart this very moment that Trump won election in November of two thousand sixteen because the economy the business people knew\nThat it was going to be a different day ah and I believe that to your point at these policies but in pursuit earlier we would have a much larger and more vibrant economy today\nKnow it's funny I'm Talking attractive or who's vice president of the national of national initiative for the Texas Public policy foundation all of that Keynesian economics gee if we just pile a bunch of money\nAnd the pomp and get the engine of the economy going again\nDoes the folks who push those kinds of policies now see that they didn't work\nThat having all that cheap money out there didn't mean anything if somebody wasn't taking advantage of it and the reason they weren't taking advantage of it is that they had the expectation that they're going to have more regulations and limitations piled on top of them and the minute Trump came into office as you say\nBusiness began to react so there were folks out there in the economy who knew\nThe moment he was elected that this was going to be the result and yet all the reporters who covered the race did not seem to know it which kind of suggests to a disconnect on on factual information\nThat apparently the reporters you know we're so focused on the election they didn't go out and said a business it's this guy actually gets in what's gonna happen instead they heard the scare headlines that you know Wall Street was gonna go upside down that the economy was going to go into a giant depression that all these bad things were I Would have happened and they were all\nParenthood in these stories while apparently all the business owners knew he gets in a we're going to be off to the races\nI think you're correct it isn't just the reporters I mean there's people like Paul Krugman those the New York times who is supposedly an economist he\nWas filled with a forecast of doom and gloom because of a President Trump's election and we see the opposite you know I don't think a lot of people are going to come out with a vehicle and admit that they all along they have too much invested this is about a world view you think that the federal government is equipped\nTo tell us how to live our lives to tell business how to operate a layer regulation up on regulation written by an elected bureaucrats\nOr do we think that liberty that freedom that that I ... the dynamism that is the American economy and ingenuity do we think that the better way to go and if you think the latter if you think that freedom is really the the answer a then your fight it come up with a completely different\nA solution than someone who thinks that centralized control and more regulations telling business what to do and what to do is the answer\nI guess ... the thing that frustrates me as a couple of things number one is not that I Want to go back and re debate the Obama administration but it's it's like one of those situations where somebody comes students as I can help you out which I thought you said well where were you two years ago or ten minutes ago or whatever was why didn't you come to me sooner well we could have had the solution sooner\nAnd I think in particular about those people who are perhaps in their late fifties\nAs we had over seven to no wait where the time when most workers make the greatest paychecks they've ever made their lives from their late fifties out to retirement most people are peeking out their careers and they're making very healthy incomes those people lost a decade\nAnd by the time we came out of it that particular group had no way to recover there was no way to say well now it's almost Seventy I'll go out and get that job back like the one I had a decade ago when the economy went to ... seven and overweight\nAnd I'll I'll make up all the ground I missed out on because there isn't the time left in their lives to do it and and they're not going to find anybody interested so those people got cheated and if\nObama with a recovered economy by June of ... said okay we're going to make sure we come out of this thing fast\nAnd and do that but but he wasn't willing to do that or and neither one of the people around him\nNo not at all but let's look on the positive side of the thinking the young people right that have never experienced a sort of economic boom that we saw under President Reagan and frankly even under President Clinton when you add the the dot com boom and of course the ...\nIt really kind of held back the expansion of the federal government\nI just hope they don't take it for granted truck divorce is with the Texas Public policy foundation Chuck\nThank you very much for that in a moment [noise] one of the richest men in the world is just passed away I interviewed Paul allowing a while back we talked\nAbout some of his passions including music you'll hear that interview coming up next Paul Allen died today at the age of sixty five ... cofounder of

McNally the executive director of free our Internet ... good to have you back on the program Oh thank you for having me so what does Google think about the possibility of legislation being written that might affect the way they operate\nKind of a to face thing with them um I think they say one thing when they're up at uh the hill and they kind of and fight to a legislation and then we have this new leaked document called that the good censor um and it talks about how they want to basically turn\nThe Internet and American into a European a utopia so [laughter] um I I think they are talking out of both sides their mouth and um I think people like you and I and the other\nPeople who are what free speech needs to keep their own feet to the fire\nYou know it's interesting that a as a search engine\nUh I I Wonder if people understand the thing you're groups have been trying to bring to people's attention and that is that by slightly changing the search results you can create an entirely different reaction by people to all kinds of things news developments and that sort of thing\nUm there was an example of it over this past weekend I was looking for some stories that I knew existed from a short while ago a couple of years ago where a man had been confronted by a group of antifa need pulled a gun to protect himself and then he was prosecuted for doing that\nAnd I know the guy's name or I Know bill from covering the story and I know how ... and I I put it in and nothing popped up about those stories and I thought I Know there there\nSo I put the name unquote marks and again it didn't pop up because it was an example where a man it actually been prosecuted for engaging in self defense and I thought I'm Wondering if this is part of their new algorithm where\nI put in you know Mike Strickland which is the guy's name and then I put in gun and then I put in charge or convicted I Know he was convicted and he was sentenced to some time in jail\nAnd the stories weren't popping up at all and I thought I wondered how I mean I was using Google is a search engine\nBut if you if you change things just to ... you can make it appear to somebody that certain stories just don't even exist even though these are in mainstream big newspapers and it was covered pretty extensively at the time do you think I'm running into some of Google's new censorship where they're trying to uh to make\nYou know make this European uh paradise you talked about\nWell and and that's not actually it's not a new thing that they're doing I'm back right after the Parkland incident\nUh for at least twenty four hours if you put in a word that had the sequence G. U. N. so like right near where I live there's been stopped you know New Hampshire and a gun and roses\nOr dozen roses and didn't exist\nWhen you put them into a wow\nYeah so they like with that sequence gee you and\nIf the word had that sequence in it it could not be found so it is not something that is new I think they um are ... people like you and I have been talking about it for such a long time now people are starting to notice it and with this document you know that was\nA lease last week people are starting to become aware I'm you know we've been\nBeing told that past two years it's a conspiracy theory there's nothing to this the algorithm as a computer you know we're not doing this on purpose well clearly\nThis document shows that they want to be a quote unquote the good censor for you know ... we're going to ban them free speech for safety and civility\nAnd how do you increase civility if you're the immediate aftermath of something terrible happening you know a plane crashes and so you say I Wonder\nAnd how do you increase civility give you the immediate aftermath of something terrible happening you know a plane crashes and so you say I Wonder what the history of plane crashes is associated with that airline you might go in and put in you know plane crash and and the name of an airline\nIf they say well we don't want to bother people you know so we're going we're just going to censor those results you don't really need to know about plane crashes or somebody has poisoned with\nYou know strychnine or poison with arsenic and so you bought in arsenic poisonings and nothing pops up how does that make them more civil what is even their argument for how that makes them more civil society when you say whatever it is people are asking about right now\nDon't tell them they can ask about it in a week\nWell my the bigger question is who are they to decide to sell for point\nAnd I guess they're straight ahead answer which is a tough one for me to answer is there a private company ... they're not a government so they can engage in any censorship they want to technically legally\nJust like I couldn't decide to take a phone call from a listener or I can decide I don't want to take the phone call from a listener nobody can force me to do that or forced me to talk about something or not talk about something they can say we're no different than you are large and so it's a tough one for me to beat\nExcept by maybe shaming them by saying why are you denying people access to the information if you want to be the index to the Internet of all things\nWell I think I think here's where where we might have them because in this document that they actually talk about being a publisher\nUm and um how they get you know right now they they get around you know the whole censorship thing because of um you know some certain legislation that you know they allows them to um ... if they can act without a you know that they\nWill go go why building right sometimes you know\nYou know the the ... communications Dietz decency act um but if they want to start considering themselves that publisher\nUm and they can start doing that kind of thing um then we can definitely um start kind of more than put putting their feet to fire the other argument that I have an even I have gone over to a couple of times um where they control\nNinety six percent of you know the search engine um\nKmart or do you know I I I mean I I Love you ours and I know a lot of people listen to you you don't have Ninety six percent market share and I wish you don't control\nI mean they're literally controlling what people see and I mean and it but let me let's let's talk about China I mean they are willing to completely put an alternate Internet in China that

in there they're going to put in the Internet and they're going to let the government tell them what those people can see and what they can spend\nIf they're willing to do it in that context why wouldn't they do it with us and they're\nAnd they're willing to do it with us because they they have a view of how it should be anyway you know and and and the crux of my argument is\nThey talk about how bad the United states you know they get up there on their little ... boxes and they say you know the United states is you know massage mistaken were horrible to minorities and all of this stuff and the reason why we have to you know do this\nIs because people are being fold and they're being bullied and and um you know\nHe's in light we have to you know it it it is because people are being

was the name of that Ford lady what was your full name wherever she a college professor because maybe I've blissfully forgotten about\nAnd Americans don't know who this is they don't know why what rules they wrote for the most part because even when we see a cabinet secretary who heads a BPA are heads up ... heads up some other agency\nThe person who actually write to the rule maybe six or eight levels\nThe BPA are heads up ... heads up some other agency\nThe person who actually write to the rule maybe six or eight levels below that person and when that person makes a changing the rules on\nI don't know how section eight housing is regulated you know in theory this the cabinet secretary above and the president above the cabinet secretary responsible for it but it was actually written by a civil service lifer who can't be fired am I wrong\nYeah no you are not wrong at all um the amazing fact is that\nIn the last twenty five years in\nEvery year the federal government's administrative agencies and regulatory agencies have put out three thousand rules wild and that's over a hundred thousand rules over the last twenty five years now they have and it hasn't been\nThat much legislation that would require all these rules so what we have is these agencies using legislation\nThat was made years ago\nTo write new rules now and the question is how would they really empowered by Congress many years ago to be writing the rules if they're writing today\nAnd that's one of the things that I think the the court system the judiciary has to look into and stop\nWell let me let me try one example on you there was a law or there was a an a a rule called title nine and as I remember the the essential purpose of it was we got all these schools public schools and colleges that have sports programs that are mostly aimed at benefiting young men\nFootball basketball baseball Gulf whatever\nAnd that you know young ladies were not getting the opportunities you write a rule and in general people said that it's probably fair if you're going to have a football team you should probably have the equivalent so that a young ladies can get some opportunities as well not a bad thought but ... and not bad in practice until you find out a couple of decades later\nBy the way it's going to regulate which bathrooms are used by transgender individuals in communities and you don't

boy who's using the lady the girls restroom now at school well how'd that happen well it has something to do with title nine\nWhile I thought that was about sports no it's been used to rewrite the bathroom is that a good example where\nWhere they've taken a threat of union is used it\nThat is an excellent example and it's something even more pervasive in the bathroom rule that is part of that and although you're entirely correct that what what Congress authorized was for any school that accept\nFederal money it has to make have a educational resources available\nOr without a correction or without any connection to sex that is women should have the same educational resources is Mitt yup what has happened to that now is that that legislation has been turned into\nA question of sexual harassment at ... although it was it was directed at schools schools were the ones that were supposed to comply all of a sudden as a result of that language\nThe education department has created a whole system for sexual harassment of student to student\nUm and so not only what sexual harassment is but then what the punishment should be and how the person who was accused\nNot only what sexual harassment is but then what the punishment should be and how the person who was accused of sexual harassment should be tried none of that would ever had been considered by Congress back windows that statute was passed in Nineteen Seventy two\nWell how do the kind of problem we're facing\nOkay we've got about a minute but Peter let me throw an idea that you\nSaw all these I don't expect that when

or sex or title nine is coming back up for a vote and if they don't vote to approve of the rules simply goes away\nDo you think that kind of thing in ten seconds would actually make a train
