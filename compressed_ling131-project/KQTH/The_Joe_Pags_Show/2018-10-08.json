R. P. S. and teachers that\nInternational course bore and they are Patricia welcome to real estate today thank you David nice to be back\nWe're glad to have you back no Patricia first of all what exactly are foreign buyers ... looking for\nWell I think just like a marketing by what they're buying when you look on their objectives and also the nature of rocket that buying and so here in Florida for instance we pay a lot of people who want to be in a result community\nAnd the value that idea of working late properties so a condo or something in a maintenance free community where they can come and go and enjoy that leisure time here and not have to worry about ... you might\nThink that that though a lot of European especially from big cities where I learned that the premium and then maybe for political column does in the home country actually like the idea of owning a single family home be a little bit of ... and the extra a privacy that that is for them\nSo it really does depend but one trend we're seeing more and more off now especially with European by as\nIf they wanna walk ability that don't want to drive they want to be able to come out of their home go shopping restaurant go and grab a cup of coffee and want to be in the outdoors so they won't walking trail that one or the cycle\nBut just on a more walkable community and a lot of times that drives them more towards downtown like areas and again that's part of the kids for buying a condo rather than a single family home\nIf you have a property listed for sale and five offers come in and one of them is from an international by or are they more competitive because often they use all cash or they just one among many\nWell it's true so low that Ninety percent of all international by it take cash\nThey tend to stay however very educated by it so they're going to the age you know how does this properties backup against competition what is it really we're in some cultures cultural I'm In\nIs to automatically make a low offer and negotiate up from that so\nQuite often at that stage do they lose if there's five other offers on the table\nYeah and so we have to educate them I say I\nFrom that so quite often at that stage do they lose if there's five other offers on the table\nYeah and so we have to educate them about you know I understand this is how you do business in your country\nBut we're in the style of market right now this is what's happening in our market and so the real story is really educate those customers about how to win and how to put folders strong offer in that particular market that fine\nHow do you actually find foreign buyers to show my house to what your process\nWhat we do is we pick that particular thing and we owe it to a broader audience through our international network but only flown up radio that you know because you're just another thing of the many problems with less things people can find on line\nSo one of the things that we do is we actually go to other countries and we do properties shows that from a part of that private shows where we work with a partner and we get that clients to comment on less than about investing in Florida we lost it\nAll the time that public shows while they're run by the policy and we'll rent space that unleashed showcase Florida all us properties to potential buyers\nActually going overseas to market your listening that is amazing Patricia there's so much more to talk about can you come back and our next hour in this time talk about how in American can buy a property in a foreign country\nI'd love to

potentially the biggest group of homeowners ever\nSo let's talk real estate now with the January member of the millennial generation drained all under Hi Jane\nHi Steven thanks for having\nMe we're so glad you're here so Jane what's on your menu today\nWell even when I started doing the segment the number one question I always got was why aren't millennials buying houses and now about three years into it and hours of material recorded later the number one question I get is millennials buying houses [laughter]\nAnd what to expect certain extend millennials like myself have started buying homes we still aren't doing so at the rate that jet actors in baby boomers did when they were our age so I spoke to a few of my renting friends about the top reasons why they haven't joined these deemed rank of homeownership pose it sounds awesome\nFirst money they don't have enough of it the teams like the obvious one and you know at the seller's market and homes are getting more expensive and that means down payments are getting healthier and half the year\nMost of these people could easily paying mortgage but sky high rent and the majority of my friends in D.C are paying between sixteen hundred and twenty four hundred dollars a month it making\nHigh rent and the majority of my friends in D.C are paying between sixteen hundred and twenty four hundred dollars a month it making it nearly impossible to save that initial big down payment ...\nNext a lot of people I spoke to aren't sure where they're going to be in the next couple of years as millennials get older and we're in our thirties now well hopefully start settling down more but for now many of us need to go where the jobs are\nThe recession meant that most of us started our careers a little later in life than most generation so that means we're still stuck in an entry level jobs chasing those stable mid level jobs\nAnd most are willing to move that that's what it takes and that means buying a home may not make the most financial land interesting\nFinally one of my friends said that there's no way he can afford to buy a house that this night is the apartment he currently living in luxury apartments with granite counters and spy bathrooms and said to the gym than someone with dog buys the other day [noise]\nOkay this is the smartest move anybody could ever make it was to find an in country\nReal four

that process like Patricia what's the first step\nIt really is on the situation generally if I'm wrong I think it's fine you know they\nKnow the area I'm not always but I Would say look people\nKnow get worked in an area that friend that has been on hold on vacation there\nFor ... looking\nAround I I talk to them about what what exactly are you looking for this and then my story is ... how how long we're going to be living that during the year you want to rent it when you're not using it so you know a lot of people by federal vacation homes and want to work for them while they are using them\nAnd that helps me understand what they're trying to change but then technically I get a picture that is a national true life partner in the right location and it's probably turn\nIt could be more than one location I had a British down on recently who wants to buy something in ... what do you really want to look at how long he wanted a little bit Costa Rica but we spend tens to hundreds in both countries and he thought this particular job and I find it on common law but\nWell the Costa Rica but we tend to into partners in both countries and he thought this particular gently decided on common law but he felt confident with the introductions we if it was so apartments in most countries getting don't really have to prove themselves as much as they would have done if he just called up from the Internet I\nDo most Americans who buy in foreign countries do they also go all cash by say either taking equity out of their properties here or cashing out stock or something along those lines\nYes they do because it's very hard for Americans to qualify for a mortgage and other kinds of trade but usually they are cash fire but you're right and that the leveraging home equity line here or selling and we'll sit here all that stuff portfolio to buy it but they would typically be cast by it in the country\nBecause of the exchange rates and how they fluctuate if I put a contract on a house or one million dollars in another country is it possible by the time I get to closing is going to be one million two hundred thousand\nIt ... the one million to two hundred thousand that could be eight hundred dollar [laughter]\nMy my advice oh is\nAny longer involved when you when you buy in a foreign country or in a foreigner by yeah there we just ... as they're trying to actually own now you know the failing thought just sort of property but there's also the currency transaction and not really because it is very carefully\nYou need to understand what's happening in your father's currency and part of their heads and now special companies right now that you can work with\nTo help you with about farming situation ... to ... they lost someone who will educated you are about things that influenced the currency exchange for it or not the key indicators that are going to be published that might have an impact on the exchange and now how your corn\nHow and when to change your money to that currency\nNo I understand there are companies that will lock in your exchange rate some of the changes you won't get stuck at the settlement table is that real\nNo absolutely it's real and they allow you to locate in the ... the ... for a period of time and all I Do is I pay ... has been a big trade in my own and not look thin actually look in the exchange rate for up to yeah\nSo it's something for customers to think about not just one that buying or selling but also when they're looking at cost of ownership you know when that thing that insurance premiums back home though fees that property taxes\nIf they can go into a year or whether they know they're always going to achieve a particular currency right\nBack very reassuring for that\nI see in the last question for Patricia yes one of our listeners wants to buy a house overseas with all your experience what's the number one piece of advice they must know before they go forward with it\nThey most use a local company love love love got the tiny should not be in any way associated with\nAll introduced by the builder the developer but real estate at Jones all the founder of that property that need to find an independent attorney to work with\nGreat advice Patricia and thank you so much\nWell thank you anytime I can help just let me know\nPatricia tan real chore and international sales director would be

economist\nJournalist or industry expert and asked them about things you need to know about and right now we've all heard the economy of the United states is chugging along strongly I mean after all the GDP is up\nEmployment is up and we all know the stock market is way up\nAnd that's apparently causing the Federal Reserve to look closely at whether they should continue to raise interest rates if they do and you're in the market to buy a house how can that affect you look to ask a professional\nJoining us now is Lawrence June the chief economist of the national association of real tours Lawrence welcome to real estate today\nAt all as Steven and as you alluded to a communist went quite terrific uh in terms of GDP Growth uh in terms of job gains wages only rising stock market is still way up there are so they're brought signed up the very positive economic picture a yet home sales\nBecause of a deal limiting inventory is being held back a compared to what it could be\nAnd of course Lawrence for all those positive reasons that the economy is so good the fed is raising interest rates do you think that's going to have any impact on buyers and the market in the months ahead\nWhen the Federal Reserve raises interest rate first we have to understand they are raising short term\nInterest rates and not long term most consumers have thirty year fixed rate mortgage so or the mortgage rate may not move\nDirect relation with what the Federal Reserve maybe doing a less or some of the homeowners have the adjustable rate mortgages Danny could change but fortunately over Ninety percent of recent homebuyers\nAre taking on those long term thirty year fixed rate mortgage so they would not feel the pain of any rising interest rates but the consumers consumers who are looking to buy a maybe the mortgage rate will inch higher and the overall forecast says\nWhich doesn't happen overnight but really focusing on it surely that we had the best quality relationship with the best professionals in place that make sure that those relationships they straw that by Britain will log into the future\nWill comment I've got to tell you I think the international scene is so important

Florida prepaid college\nPlanned and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and defense than our income has gone down and we added another child\nAnd we've gotten into San credit card debt and they have a car loan now and\nWe can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without penalty chilly here that are hitting weekend's half our debt and leave that money and continue contributing to their prepaid plan\nHow much is in there [noise] um about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars on how much do you own your car\nWe ever had that done and what do you own your credit cards all five thousand\nOkay and um are you guys on a budget and reducing debt already\nWe just started at ... and that's and I realized we did that and he's got that an orderly having pizza pan ... played pan and then I don't know what to do at this point gotcha okay I'm In your household income as well\n[noise] um I had the next twenty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget follow through with what you're learning and financial piece university and just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency a no rush but some time\nYup see if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency\nAh no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an e essay and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I\nPrepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price because that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent inflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time minded and so on you make more\nBy putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run\nAnd they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the fun of still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return all my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your eighty six hundred bucks into five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a\nA ... I was going through a few for the last seven years and we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ...\nTo my question because this was a wonderful thing it's fixing to happen or we were in my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a fuel oil wells but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell ... and cash out or hopefully you know are being told don't sell because there's gonna be\nWe should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom [laughter] and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one of the reasons west Texas is struggling right now oh prices are so far down that there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom baby I mean\nBut uh and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in\nA [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell although at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or what you it's it's simply a they're looking at the three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you just add on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah and we are not oil people\nYeah I think one thing I'm asking him as women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\nWere deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business as if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars powdered milk kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die and ...\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market crash yeah well\nIt might but I Am I going to sell you start getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes\nYeah we're hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all persons to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father make a decision\nOh I see so is it just yeah they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they are just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and a ... you know\nSo that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's miles from real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not some advise set of families in tire\nUh some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not [noise] some advise set of families entire portfolio three million dollar networks we caught up in ...

of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nOh we've got a uh like house we don't rent it out and we've got a condo in another city we don't rent it out and um so it has to be a our income and our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy interest a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in them you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over knocks when when the ball game over there and the heat and air was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that
