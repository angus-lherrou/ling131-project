when it comes to know\nNext in all from friends and from listeners to this program is\nIs there anybody out there we couldn't believe when they started making predictions about how the elections are going to go two weeks from now and the answer I usually give them is not well most of the smartest folks out there were terribly wrong two years ago about the sixteen election and I'm not sure there are much better now Peter Rob joins me now who's a Newsweek contributing editor\nAnd a ... do you think that all the protections of the big blue wave are going to come true for the Democrats and two weeks\nA G G took about a no pressure introduction [laughter] I could be really as ours\nUm no I don't I'm On unless\nUnless there is some kind of unforeseen spike in turn out that exist only on the Democratic side or\nThere's some kind of I hate the phrase October surprise but some kind of defining moment it throws the president is a huge district ... like leeks\nPurportedly from inside the Mueller investigation or some kind of armed confrontation that leads to a massacre or with the caravan of folks who are walking towards America from Honduras I think this election largely ends up a push\nTo another was neither side gains a lot or loses a lot even on the house side\nEven on the ... even in the U.S house I I I I think that\nUm there's some very interesting numbers out there if you if you break them down\nAnd that you know the national generic ballot is interesting it shows the Democrats have just on average about an eight and a half point lead right now right important to remember that in Nineteen Ninety four um they had a three point lead on election day\nAnd they lost control the house for the first time in four years in the fifties sweet sing fifty feet\nSwing um there's a little bit more defined polling ABC had a poll out last week that looked at the sixty seats where their ratings um the wedding the top separate leans that they're not\nThat they're not put away and in those in in in that the the the generic ballot was margin of error\nI Am I just wonder why it is led by one point\nWhen you see these other metrics Peter like the president's ah favorability rating is about where Obama's was at this point in Obama's president so you know I Know we had a sadder economy back then\nBut that's part of what plays into whether people have a positive impression on Trump's numbers among black voters are almost unbelievable I mean to go from eight percent and election day in sixteen two twenty three percent almost triple\nAnd then to go to thirty six percent now and that's usually a group of voters that the Democrats practically own lock stock and barrel\nIt that's right and it it's interesting in terms of perspective I think Trump there's a poll out today\nUm I it may be Rasmussen um\nThat shows that Obama that that Trump's popularity is actually a little bit higher than Obama's was at this point going into the midterms but if you if you think back and remember the coverage in that in that in that first two years Obama was regarded as a wildly popular president\nWho had a who had a hard core conservative\nUm dislike\nFor him but that he was popular\nUm the media today looks the same numbers and say well Trump is unpopular and that's because Trump is unpopular\nUm the media today looks the same numbers and say well Trump is unpopular and that's because Trump is unpopular with the people who are looking at the numbers not because it's the way the country feels about him and and and this is part of the part of the problem with with with the election forecasting\nUm is when you um\nYou know what the what the metrics you use help determine their results and if you put garbage and you're going to get garbage out\nWell the other thing and and I keep reminding people are this if you took any single subject\nAnd had the entire national news media spend two years telling you how bad acts was\nAt the end of two years you'd have Americans thinking just about as low in opinion of whatever axe was as possible and they've done that to Trump's rise as you point out they've done they did the polar opposite with with Obama they had ... goes up the leg and they they thought he walked on water and they they they believed all those things about him and they said\nAnd how how dare you other nationally known radio talk show how come out and say you want Obama to fail I wanted a hell of an American that is yeah and and how long that was um and now I'm\nYou people ethically jumping down and cheerleading for Trump to fail and ... that's the sense it's the voice of America it's wonderful it's it's terrific it's phenomenal um so perception has a lot to do with it\nBut I I think right now the balance of power\nUm the the people who are really going to determine which way this election is going to go to\nOur suburban let's call them establishment Republicans are Bush Republicans\nThey're not necessarily driven by issues they're not necessarily driven by one particular thing um but they sort of look at\nLook at look at the whole universe of things and they've always been Republicans and they didn't like the Trump tweets and they didn't like the way he behaved in the campaign and the way that he talked to Jeb Bush the way that he talked to John Case in their ... yeah the Access Hollywood tape make some kind of uncomfortable um\nAnd so they may have been turned off to the Republicans but then they saw what the Democrats did to Brett\nKavanaugh mostly I Wonder if ... is one of them\nWas that plan is the early October surprise that was supposed to dismantle the president and everybody behind him and now the caravan is the second October surprise do they have time in the next to a fourteen Thirteen Days\nOr sorry fourteen days to be able to make a difference with another surprise drop so late in the game that there isn't any practical ability to respond to it\nWell it it ... there's always that possibility it again this is why I feel for example fear for example something like a leak coming from what his purported to be the Mueller investigation\nThat says that after the election and after the deadlines have pet the statutory deadlines to pass the president is going to be indicted\nOr you know a recommendation would be made to indict him for bank fraud or um indicted him for corrupt foreign practices or nothing to do with Russian collusion nothing to do with anything we've already covered that that that the people are tired of hearing about that something new something sexy um\nYou'll you'll recall how everybody was protecting it was the ... it was the end of end of days and and the crack of doom for Trump when they gave immunity to the fellow who's been a long time um CFO the Trump Organization yeah um the\nThe explosion with which the New York times\nUm dissected Fred trumps stolen tax returns which also has apparently turned out to be nothing uh and and I wouldn't be surprised\nStolen tax returns which also has apparently turned out to be nothing uh and and I wouldn't be surprised if there were some kind of last minute\nI'm Sunday afternoon a explosives release on the Internet\nSome scandalous story\nA ditch attempt it it's an attempt to um\nDiscredit the president and drive down Republican turnout is it that's really what a lot of these negative stories are about and what a lot of this continuous negative um poll analysis is about it's about voter suppression it's about telling the Republicans\nYou're going to lose don't feel that the ashamed don't show up jokes up\nI'm Talking to Peter out from Newsweek Peter I got to wrap it up but I got to tell you some of the things though that the left seems to think of as slams on Trump\nI listen to a discussion about a week ago of this giant piece the New York times did on all the efforts by Trump's father to put money into account for his children and I remember thinking well you folks all think this is bad because you hate Trump\nBut I'll bet every mom and dad out there would like to find a way if they had the extra cash to say\nA Rasmussen poll shows the President Trump is more popular at this point in his presidency than President Obama was and at times the difference is almost ten percent\nThe poll released by the wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Trump's approval is the highest it's been since he was elected and I'll remind you\nHe's more popular than Obama was at the time\nObama got nothing but great press the first two two years he was in office frankly he got it most of the eight years that it was an office\nBut the first two years were almost it was this slobbering love affair\nBetween the mainstream fake stream press and Brock Obama meanwhile Trump got exactly the opposite every reporter with a TV camera or a microphone or an Internet Web page was telling you all the reasons you should have Donald Trump\nSo with all that he is now beating Obama by as much as ten points it's extraordinary let's go to Diane Diane you heard is talking about talking about that invasion caravan that's headed north that I Know is going to reach our border before election day what's your take on it\nFor a long time listener first time caller thank you very\nWell thank you very concerned about this is one thing that I've never heard anybody talk about this is a humongous I should say there's gotta be behind it\nYeah who is feeding them clothing and what about sanitation where they said what about what I Know I heard on the TV oh well you know the Mexicans are handled a lot of stuff like that you know it doesn't it can ... I mean\nDiane I earlier this hour you and I are thinking on the same lines 'cause earlier this hour I was asking out loud as I began the hour\nWho is doing all that if you assume let's say it's less expensive because it's Mexico and you're not eating and some tourist place\nLet's suppose you could feed seven thousand adults on five dollars a day a day not a meal so you can feed him on five dollars that's thirty five thousand dollars a day\nSomebody is put that money up somewhere and my guess is the people in the caravan don't have that kind of money they've also said that they are going to be moving them by buses now\nWill seven thousand people at Seventy people per bus is a hundred buses a hundred drivers a hundred diesel supplies to be able to move Seventy buses\nOr or or a hundred buses north was Seventy people each individual ten thousand then it's a hundred buses I mean that's that's a substantial bill no matter where you go\nAny label it's just and I I I Love that sounds a little ticked off at play he's really got to get released all get the carry on\nI think that's what he's going to do and if he does he's sending those financial messages I just talked about a moment ago by the way I Want to tell you about this a federal judge this came from a hearing on friday a federal judge says the U.S State Department was providing cover for the\nI Want to tell you about this a federal judge this came from a hearing on friday\nA federal judge says the U.S State Department was providing cover for the Clintons\nThat the state department and provided folds statements\nThis federal judge unabashedly accused careers State Department officials of lying and signing clearly ... to derail a series of lawsuits seeking information about former secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and her handling of the twenty twelve terrorist attack\nOn the U.S consulate in Benghazi\nDo are you seeing how much time and attention is being spent on Jamal could show ... the man who was apparently murdered in the Saudi consulate in Turkey in his ...\nDo you remember how little attention was paid to the Americans who died in ...

Honduras quite coincidental for the midterm elections is this part of the October surprise a Democrat seem to come up with\nEvery time there was a major election in America and take just a moment to cast a vote my Twitter Paul\nHere's the question and ... and based on the fact that ...\nIt's a major election in America and take just a moment to cast a vote my Twitter poll\nHere's a question and ... and it's based on the fact that the New York times is reporting the Trump Administration is considering defining gender\nNow if you're thinking to yourself well Lars I already know a gender is you're either a boy or you're a girl and if you're born a boy then you stay a boy if you're born a girl you stay a girl you can change your outward appearance you can change your clothing you could even go to a surgeon or if you want to\nAnd make some physical changes in your body\nBut the chromosomes that make up whether you're male or female they stayed the same no matter what your DNA stays the same unless you're Elizabeth Warren in which case you can look as hard as far as you can to see if you can find some Native American blood in your background yeah\nThat's that she created her own problem with that so this is the way the New York times but it's the Trump Administration considering narrowly defining gender as a biological condition determined by ... at the genitalia birth the most drastic\nMove yet wow drastic\nTo go back to saying it's boys and girls and a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protection of transgender people we've talked about this a lot on the program a series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened up the legal concept of gender and federal program so in other words\nMore details on proposition three of six and others got a

seems to change a fairly frequent bases in the news these days and\nOver the last week or so the biggest story has been a massive caravan of people I call it the invasion caravan that is headed toward America's southern border\nThey are still a little under two thousand miles away but they seem to be making pretty good speed at this point\nThey've already busted through the wall of the barricades\nOr to get out of Guatemala to get into Mexico and now I'm actually goes apparently just law allowing this massive caravan heading north toward the United states a lot of talk about that with Maria as ... who's the national director of the remembrance project Maria welcome back to the program\nHello and thanks so much for having me on again\nSo is this the October surprise that the Democrats usually a plan for every every ... every major election America\n[laughter] right they orchestrated and then they try to place the blame on President Trump's shoulders and you're trying to make him look like an evil person in the Republican Party as the evil when I was trying to do is to protect our borders\nAnd in fact the president said if he needs to put the military on the border do you think that's what we're up against because this caravan started at one thousand it's now supposed to be at seven thousand or greater ... they're been numbers that are greater than that not now by the time it hits the border if ...\nTaxes here my talent he mentioned in the last two weeks they were fifty four hundred family units coming through and this is in advance of that care of and you know also you know they captured a gang members cartels and of course there were over\nSeven hundred pounds of marijuana and other drugs I think it's it's overwhelming for the ice for the border patrol agents um there has to be some help there and that's what he's asking for is for reinforcement\nI thought we might actually get some help from Mexico when President Trump last week said he should to Mexico if you don't help us stop this then we may end up with no trade deal whatsoever and I thought a mutually Mexico was trying to help but now I guess not\nRight and just think of it this way um I think that that Mexico of course is helping the Democrat Party and should\nUm [noise] the Democrats win this mid term they would of course move again to impeach President Trump and they would implement their far left agenda so this is a win situation for Mexico and and you know a large that they have no intention in stopping this invasion\nNo and in fact I didn't get Trump out of the way and if they can take away one house of Congress then they stop him from passing anything as a bill which pushes them back to the only other thing you know ... is executive orders and I've been very proud that this president\nHas not used executive orders in place of legislation the way his predecessor did so frequently\nWhat else can we do to get those things don't\nWell I think that the making people need to speak up or they certainly need to be showing their support and making their voices heard calling the White House it to zero to four five six\nEleven eleven and telling President Trump that we support him and we support placing the military on the border in order to stop the invasion and protect America and American lives and also I think that we need to go ahead and I'm obviously go vote and vote for those who will\nStand for securing our border and foreign America First agenda that President Trump is\nPushing forward but he can't do it alone you know we can send the use of military we can uh\nTake that trade deal off the table from you can you know we can also um implement some sort of um I Would say\nAdditional fees or assess fees wherever possible like the remittances fees you know Mexico has assessed fees for the money going into their country from the United states you know let's take it back on that and really\nMake them feel the pain because the men's feeds uh that that gardeners the Mexico and the Mexico just about two billion dollars\nA month on those remittances that is why the from the money wired into Mexico you know they have every intention again to continue that flow of money and to push their citizens um onto the American taxpayer while\nTrying to collect the U.S foreign aid and U.S foreign aid has to be taken off the table as well a\nMemory or would you remind reminding my audience about them remember and project and what that is all about\nWhat led to we started in two thousand nine as a voice for victims killed by illegal aliens and naturally Lars November fourth of this year we're going to recognize the national day of remembrance for Americans killed by illegal aliens\nThis is our seventh year to recognize this national day we want to make sure that this issue is not swept under the rug once again and you know\nThat you recognize this national day\nWe want to make sure that this issue is not swept under the ride once again and you know President Trump have also asked him to officially a nationally proclaimed this ... um so that we can fix the problem you know the families are American families are permanently separated from their last one\nNever to see them again until they reach Kevin\nOh one hundred percent preventable and it's the lack of the spine and courage and doing the right thing that the politicians who I like to do and protect America\nAnd follow our constitution and that's the reason why\nThere are ... are wonderful falling Americans who have lost their lives so\nYou know we we do we also Lars has a\nChaplain St group and a crisis intervention group where we help the family and get the help that they need and psychologically emotionally to sell you know we're dealing a lot of faith which is so very great oh that President Trump has that he Exxon with on this issue and listened to I ate all moms and dads\nBut you know we have to get off the stuff that they get a sense of family and to help out and speak out\nYou know the only ideas dad do yours I liked the idea of taxing the remittances but I think there may be an easier way to do it um\nYou know that the IRS has all kinds of rules even for American citizens if you go down to your bank for some reason and deposit around ten thousand dollars the IRS gets notified because they know that they don't want people hiding cash\nI have a feeling a lot of the remittance money that is sent back is money that earned is cash\nBy illegal aliens who are working illegally in this country and when they send it out of the country by going down to a convenience store a place where they can buy Western Union money order and send it to their families it effectively hides it for tax purposes and I have a feeling a lot of it was was has they've not pay taxes on it so say\nIf you're a legal American citizen or a green card holder you have the Social Security number if you want to send money by Western Union say more than a hundred dollars\nA at a time you're gonna have to show Social Security number if you don't you have to pay a fee and you could make the feet produced up you could make it five or ten percent and say this is a way of reminding folks ah that that you are not going to be able to dodge the tax man and that we understand that if you're spending that money south\nOr we can stop you from sending the money but we could say you have to have Social Security number or it's a five or ten percent the\nThe other thing I Would suggest to Americans is we're heading into the fall where it gets cold in most parts of America\nA lot of people decided to take vacation time and sometimes they vacation in Mexico both because you know there's a lot of sun and because it's inexpensive it might be a good idea I don't sponsor boycotts because I think my audience is smart enough to make their own decisions\nBut have a vacation in the United states in skip Mexico and ... send them a message that if they're willing to help people invade our country then we don't need to be spending tourist dollars which are also important to Mexico Maria what's the website very quickly for the remembrance\nThe deregulation a deregulatory steps that we've seen from the Trump Administration and Democrats are basically saying look if we can't mandate Obamacare\nLet's ban all the other option so people have no other choice then they're stuck in it and I think that's a far guys were any good at talking about health care on the stump they would be carrying Democrats up on that things are horrible vote from them\nAnd they somehow said we're protecting preexisting condition or a\nProvisions which makes no sense because this you know they're basically voted to repeal a guaranteed renew ability in the short term market well you know if you get sick and develop a preexisting condition guaranteed renew abilities of great protections you don't have to go into Obamacare and yet that's exactly what they voted to repeal so if anything it was the opposite of what they kind of\nMade their talking point on this vote in the media basically let them get away with it to the extent they paid attention at all\nKnow fill over the weekend I heard more people document a pre existing conditions\nDo I I Want to I Want you to testify numbers on this and see if this works I Wish we could knock this issue out altogether once and for all and here's how I Do it I've talked to a few different experts including Betsy McCoy and you and others\nWho knows this issue well and they say you know for all the talking about pre existing conditions the total number of people who meet that description\nBut when others who know this issue well and they say you know for all the talk about pre existing conditions the total number of people who meet that description is about four hundred thousand and they base that on the number of people who signed up with Obamacare for pre existing conditions the number of people who are in risk pools before Obamacare came along\nIt's four hundred thousand people out of three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAnd the total cost of covering those people it's a high premium it averages thirty two thousand dollars a year\nBut in terms of a national policy is twelve billion dollars is a drop in the bucket in a federal budget that is four thousand billion dollars and you need twelve dollars twelve billion dollars to cover it\nIf we passed a law that said if you are you know judged to have a pre existing condition and it's not it's one that actually takes a lot of money to cover\nThen we're just going to cover you were just period unless you you know or make more than five hundred thousand dollars years I mean you could set some income limits on it and you'd knock that issue out altogether and say now let's solve the rest of the problem was let the private sector do most of it and the only other big issue I'm aware of\nIs the one where people say but if you're going along happy and healthy and some things strikes you down you need a above a triple quadruple bypass or you need a liver transplant or something like that\nSay fine let's sell catastrophic plans let's not have the government do it let's have the private sector of the government were to say to the private sector insurance folks hey\nCan you come up with a product that's what they called the insurance industry my wife\nUsed to work for ... a long time ago um have a product that will cover you for catastrophes right it's a kind of coverage most people have if they paid off their cars just one policy that covers you only if things go completely terribly wrong and those can be sold very cheaply to\nNow you've covered people for catastrophic loss you've covered all the people the four hundred thousand\nThat are that have pre existing conditions now the rest of it for the most part\nIs the stuff where people wanted Obamacare to pay for maintenance basically they wanted you to pay for everything from birth control pills to your annual checkup and everything else which I don't think should be the subject of insurance any more than I think my car insurance should cover the maintenance on my car now my wrong on the numbers that I'm getting this wrong\nWell I I Would I Would disagree only with your last point at the end there because Obamacare actually in practice has extremely high deductible\nWe are all paying these very high premiums are not going to cover done any of that routine stuff or even a more expensive stuff than that and so you know the the perverse effect here is that we've got essentially high deductible\nPlans but we're paying a fortune in premiums for them anyway and there there's no other there's no other choices available because of the regulatory structure um you know that these number four hundred thousand might be right I think\nThat it's probably a little on the high end because the first four years after Obamacare passed before the exchanges launched there was something called the preexisting condition insurance plan which massively subsidized people with preexisting conditions so they could get coverage if they were\nUh you know uninsured of all because the exchanges hadn't launched yet and they the total\nEnrollment and that was about a hundred and twenty nine thousand now might get a lot of money I'd run out of money prematurely say maybe\nThey were twice or three times as many people that wanted to go and what have you is that if it hadn't run out of money but I I think if anything has the highest met from that city\nAlso so maybe it's a couple of hundred thousand it's the kind of thing that is a very affluent country a wealthy country like ours could easily say\nIf you're one of those people with a ... a catastrophic metal medical condition her condition that goes on for a long time and it's a pre existing condition that caused a huge amount of money to cover we could cover it and we could say that something we ought to do as a society unless you're already getting it through your work will be glad to\nMoney to cover we can cover it and we could say that's something we ought to do as a society

the law and I've asked John's mirror to join his senior editor at the stream and author of the new politically incorrect guide to immigration John good to have you back on\nThank you couldn't it be although this is a very grim occasion it is and told me one this is an invasion by couldn't keep the doors let's just call it what it is\nThese people are no more refugees than Cortez and his soldiers were when they arrived in Mexico\nOr not I would agree with you\nYeah they're not asking permission to come into our country because they're genuine refugee first of all refugees someone who is persecuted by his government the way\nJews were persecuted by Nazi Germany and they sell to the United states and tragically France Franklin Roosevelt ... away those Jews on those boats\nPeople and like you know it would end up like Anne Frank we're not waving Nazi flags they will not screaming about how they're going to carry out on a\nNazi Germany traditions and culture in the United states\nOkay what when you see people claiming to recognize that and they're waving the flag of the country that allegedly persecute them maybe it's time to be suspicious\nAnd by the way they don't fit the asylum seeker label either do there\nNo no ... on either of those counts they should stay in the first safe country they reach now of course they were perfectly safe in Honduras or wherever they came from but they're pretending they were at the moment they got to Mexico they should apply for for asylum or refugee status and they're not doing it\nAnd let a single one of these people not one\nInto this country I don't care if we have to\nSet the Rio Grande on fire the way the Cuyahoga caught fire in the seventies this cannot happen\nNot agree with you because John we're going to get more of this and you know what probably set this off most recently and tell me if I'm wrong about this\nDrew Donald Trump adopted a zero tolerance policy and the Democrats treated like a hobby horse and said no you can't do that because you're separating\nParents from children many of the adults were not the parents of those children friday of them had no connection at all we know that because some of them some of the parents some of the adults I should say we're told you you can go home do you want to take your kids with you know I'm leaving them here\nWell that's because they weren't really connected they were probably assisting in trafficking those kids but the right and\nThen the child pornography or slave labor and the Obama administration ... or let ten thousand kids go with the people who claimed to be their parents and they found the working a slave labor as an egg factories and I in Idaho\nSo the bottom line is is is that these people will try to cross the border illegally and I've had people saying well you know they can't do this or to bigger group I think they are planning to overwhelm the border patrol knowing that\nYou know I mean we see this on a smaller scale do we have fifty illegals encounter a half\nA dozen border patrol agents those agents may be able to stop half a dozen people or or a dozen people but many of them get right on by so if you swarmed the border with seven thousand or who knows it maybe ten thousand\nBecause this thing has been growing like crazy over the last week or so it went from one thousand and four thousand announce seven and may be headed for ten they get to the border and their ten thousand strong\nHow in the world are you going to stop them short of using the option that President Trump says he will use and that's the military\nOh absolutely ...\nWorld are you going to stop them short of using the option that President Trump says he will use and that's the military\nOh absolutely we should use the military and we should we hit them drones flying over them now dropping leaflets telling them that they're not welcome in as they approach the border we should have maybe drones spraying with Cathy or something and these people need to be deterred they need to know that we will use what ever force is necessary\nIncluding deadly force if they if they attack our border guards and kill them if they trampled then\nThen the military will use violent force this is an invasion of our country by foreign mop if we have on this\nThe entire population of Latin America is going to walk across the land bridge into the United states and then the entire large parts of the population of the Muslim world will get on boats the way they're doing in the Mediterranean they will sales in the United states you we will be inundated it will be over\nAnd he was an existential crisis in the United states of\nAmerica and by the way it is and we want exist or not\nYou know John these are not all Hondurans are Guatemalans or Mexicans they're finding apparently there are people there from Bangladesh which is another uh apparently in the first the first nine ten months of this year we've seen six hundred Bangladeshis cross into the United states\nOver those our southern border so they say\nThere's long been relating operational relationship between al ... who did the nine eleven attacks and Central American cartels like MS Thirteen\nSo that means that they've seen this is the way to get in don't try to sneak in through a regular port of entry\nFly into South America Central America come north on buses or whatever where you can find your way north get past the borders and then just to enter the United states surreptitiously across a wide open border maybe we should take some of\nThe tens of millions that we're going to take away from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador as punishment\nFor them not helping us with this problem and spend it on building a wall\nWe absolutely have to build that we need to build a wall electrify it and set it on fire man this is this is out wages and it's being ginned up just in time for the elections and I think I Know why I mean there are activists walking around handing out money organizing buses and trucks down there\nThis is not a spontaneous movement is no political ... and it's got your sources\nGreasy fingerprints all over it but people say well why why would they do this so close to the election don't they realize it's going to help the Republicans they don't they get will they think Trump will cave the way he caved over separating families and they think if they can get across the border he will cave and the Republican base will be so depressed\nDiscussing spirited that they won't turn out to vote\nNo but but you know John over the weekend I tweeted out that when I saw the video of this crowd coming up to the gates leaving Guatemala and going across the bridge in New Mexico and they simply burst through the gates wrecked you know rip them down and went on through\nAnd then the crowded that bridge wall you know from edge to edge with with illegal aliens or future I mean they weren't crossing into Mexico legally so I think I could still called them illegal aliens because they weren't entering through any kind of process I said this is the best the ad for Donald Trump's wall but I've seen in a long time\nBut you're right if the Democrats have calculated if we force the president to threaten to use the military and then he doesn't and they cross in\n... Republicans and conservatives will be a demoralized by that\nAbsolutely but if they are yeah\nThey break out our fences and march onto it\nTurbulence will be a demoralized by that absolutely but if if we got ours up yeah\nIf they break out our fences and march onto a bridge like that we need to blow up the Brits before they get to it they if they escalate we escalate well we had a I mean and I try to avoid casually blow it up before they reach it they can't be allowed\nTo clarify that because I said well they get to it yeah because they're not foreign combatants but I Would say we use everything we can and what is the United states military I mean our military is great winning wars but they also know how to guard a perimeter and if you would have already I'm an artist at the perimeter is now\nThe edge of our country make sure nobody comes in I think we\nAre in the border that Afghanistan why can't we guard the borders of the United states I mean really a Donald Trump needs to open military bases\nAll along our southern border use eminent domain if necessary and use use federal money to link them by a by a fence it by a border fence if he can't\nThey failed to remember that there had been assassination attempts and there are people that will tag along with the masses when they're I'm putting a or a variety of yelling and screaming that just so they can get closer to a candidate we know that John Hinckley junior was very very close to president\nBefore he actually shot George Wallace was shot by an assassin who was yelling at people in the crowd that they were cheering loudly enough or George Wallace so what people don't understand when they sit there and say well why did you act\nThis why why did you move away or run away or not address these people who are approaching you are in public and screaming at you like what it is with good reason you have no idea what their motivations are motivations of the main people in the protest maybe honorable if you can call them honorable may be disrespectful but they're they don't mean any harm\nBut the public officials had to be concerned about others can they be tagging along with the same thing with law enforcement what somebody approaches a vehicle the officer has no idea if that person is going to ask\nDirections or if that person is trying to get close to them or for that purpose we've seen a tax on law enforcement where two or three people were saying hey why don't you get away from that guy is not you know given the past don't arrest them and then someone comes up based on the officer being distracted and physically attacked them\nYou know I've seen that myself land so I told you I used to go on a lot of ride along and I I'd have officers who to watch\nIf we're going on are arrested for shoplifting or had a convenience store and in particular neighborhoods we'd have a crowd of fifty people standing round who's very quickly and you don't know which ones are just looking to lose and which ones are potentially dangerous to the officer but there was a lot of the shouting\nAnd then more recently we've seen a tax on General Mattis and others you know attempts to take their lives or rice and it's as though there's just a whole\nYou know sort of spectrum of different ways that anybody an authority or or a political position is is being attacked a police officer is part of that he's where the rubber meets the road you know when it comes to government policy we have laws we have to have men and women in uniform who enforce them\nAnd now they're being viewed as as a potential target by people who have some kind of beef either against society or against the laws or against the enforcement of laws\nYeah you know we heard a there's a video out you can find and I I tend not to talk about these people there's only ... anymore airplay but there's a video out as a woman who's questioned about a kid in the neighborhood you're shot a cop and she just looks at the ...\nYou know these are the officers that are going into communities that other people wouldn't go to on a bet with all of their doors locked in their windows rolled up and you know they're going in there and trying to make a difference or they just responding to calls from health for help from\nLaw abiding citizens that live there that you know are trying to have their kids weight on a school bus without somebody tried selling drugs\nYou know and and how do we get on top of that if the whole community is so distrustful of the cops that they take that attitude that if a cop was shot so what I mean\nThat that you know I Want the cops to go home alive every single night but I also want them to be able to go into a community and get real communication that might help them find the person who's ... you know child trafficking or the person who's selling doping community\nAnd that kind of attitude from members of the community is just not helpful at all\nSo it's not in the way that you combat it is you start telling the story of all the good things officers do every day ah we see it all the time and and you have to yell louder\nThe story of all the good things officers do every day ah we see it all the time and and you have to yell louder people say well you know I talked about what happened no you need to yell out or if there's an officer that does something in your community that benefit everybody put it on every social media platform you could imagine\nCall the news until they do a story about it and there's they they're doing things everyday law enforcement officers do things every day that are not in their job description\n[noise] just to protect people you know we had floods in Austin we had a terrible hurricane they came through\nGeorgia and Florida and you can find reports of officer is going to work when their houses didn't exist as a matter of fact there's a company called relentless defender in Texas the great company they found out that officer some of them their uniforms just completely blew away so they started printing T shirts that said police officer\nSo they would have some way to patrol the communities you know while their families have been shipped out and evacuated they're still staying in the community to protect the people that are strangers to them\nLance is the author of when cops kill and blue news the profits go to police officer
