the chicken noodle news networks CNN was the president mocking Christine forward let me tell you something the White House is saying that the president was merely stating facts and then he was not mocking\nBut I'll tell you what I'm going to do if the president was mocking Christian forward I think said she richly deserved to be mocked and then some and let me tell you why\nWe have heard for years now especially in the post Harvey Weinstein ... twelve months or so we've been told that when a woman makes an accusation that woman must be believed\nI say women must be taken seriously and there was a minor difference\nIf somebody makes an accusation that is a serious accusation one that could lead to jail time in some cases could lead in this case to the end of an entire man's career that he has spent more than forty years building\nI think that you should take her accusation seriously but if it turns out that she's made the accusation falsely but it's not based on much of anything\nAnd that she can't even name witnesses who remember what she remembers and if it has the effect\nOf holding up the entire country holding up the nomination of a new Supreme Court justice holding up certain cases that will not be heard by the Supreme Court even Brett Kavanaugh is as I expect he will be confirmed on either friday or Saturday\nThe report from the FBI is coming back this afternoon the White House has it in hand as we speak they just got a short time ago it will be going to Capitol Hill after that senators and representatives will be able to read it\nJust ... one short

was about to leave\nSo he went through his car and called nine one one I happen to me if I'm right place at the right time it turns out the woman was being held against her will buy an abusive ex

M. C. fools dot com CFC custom pools or motivation simply the right choice\nAnd talk hey it's Chris plant don't forget my shows on right after\nOh did five law enforcement officers have been shot in an active ... active shooter situation is going on in Florence South Carolina they apparently have a suspect in custody officials say that for a for three four Orange County deputies and to Florence city police officers were injured or wounded\nConditions unclear at this point\nI Will give you more information as it becomes available but just sparrow thought and say a prayer for those officers and for their family members and their colleagues I'd appreciate it tonight we'll get to the information as it's available\nA we've been talking about the various accusers of Brett Kavanaugh and whether or not their stories are legitimate or not the more time that goes on the more we seemed to find that contradicts those stories and suggested they were not very well established at all\nBut the ... TV networks seem to be ignoring some of the best evidence out there that is coming in from folks and I thought I'd get ... draining on who's ... senior news analyst for the media Research Center ... glad to have you back on the program\nI'm Glad to be back with you on the on\nSo tell me about this there is one big piece of evidence in a letter that was written by the former boyfriend of ah Christine Ford uh the the big TV networks seem to be ignoring to some extent tell us about that\nYeah basically a Fox News I got a copy of this letter that a an ex boyfriend of of course in for a sense of the Senate Judiciary committee and it was basically him telling them listen you know when I was dating her for her for six years\nShe told me specifically things that contradict what she said in her testimony at the Senate Judiciary committee hearing a namely that\nYou know she was asked specifically by the prosecutor Rachel Mitchell did you have you ever advised anyone on how to take a polygraph test\nOr anything like that and of course ... said now but her ex boyfriend in this letter says no actually she told me in detail about\nActually advising people on how to do a polygraph test on what it entails and how to prepare for it and you know the whole process so that seems like a glaring contradiction with what she testified under oath about\nYeah she does try and under oath if you lie under circumstance like that it's perjury even though it was before Congress and not before a court and this wasn't just a man who dated her some of that six years they lived together so they were in\nClose proximity and they were they were at that level of a relationship he actually said in one of the cases I witnessed Dr Ford\nHeld Monica McLean her best friend at the time to prepare for a potential polygraph exam she explained in detail what to expect how they work and help McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nThat's a significant answer because she directly contradicted that near sworn testimony and yet how much time or the networks spending on that any at all\nWell ABC and CBS or completely ignored it this morning on their morning shows and uh NBC it was mentioned by making Kelly\nWho I have to get main kind of credit she has been the only people on the blog that we're actually trying to be a journalist about this story and cover all of the facts that are coming in so she covered the today show did not cover it so from seven AM tonight I Am\nYou could not find a story on NBC but at nine AM once everybody is at work no longer at home watching the show\nAnd I find this story on NBC but at nine am you know once every body is at work no longer at home watching the show then that's when finally Megan Kelly brought this this story to light on on NBC or for you know a minute or so\nAnd that was it so yeah they have not touched the story really and they're not very interested in the\nTile or I'm Talking to college running from the media research on the other issue because and I want people to understand why I think this is so significant and that is\nIf you have a case that is entirely he said she said in other words there aren't any other witnesses there's no physical evidence of the crime of this solved\nThat she says Brett Kavanaugh committed against or thirty six years ago so you have to either trust her testimony or trust his testimony is being accurate so it's very important to evaluate whether somebody is trustworthy and whether or not they tell the truth\nUm she also had testified in was questioned about\nThe after effects of this terrible you know incident that happened and she described the Jews claustrophobic that her new how she insisted had to have\nTo separate front doors instead of one and that she was so you know frightened of of or claustrophobic that she couldn't fly over for the most part could not fly on airplanes except in extreme occasions\nOr this letter from the boyfriend a contradicts that doesn't it\n[laughter] yeah I Know basically it's it's ... yeah she said that the second front door was right as a result of you know the trauma related to that sensitive\nBut it turns out well not all of that separate front door was so you know she could see clients you know have have been doing a separate entrance uh when she meant you know see clients at home I mean she's a psychologist so it like that was the the ... it was very practical\nProfessional reason that really does not match with the reasoning that she gave an are testable\nRight and she also also the the question about flying I I knew that early on it was established that while she said she almost was incapable of flying that she'd actually gone on vacation flight tour she flew to\nFrench Polynesia she flew to Costa Rica and the boyfriend describes that they took frequent flying trips together even including one on a small propeller plane that apparently she was able to do that but she was telling the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat she might have to drive from California to Washington DC because she was so frightened of flying on airplanes\n[noise] yeah no and I need yeah that was one of those things that was even for a fact checked in real time by Rachel Michel ... pointed out well you you have flown on other occasions we we know you have so why you know why the wire you suddenly afraid of flying you know in this situation\nSo yeah I mean there's the media has been so obsessed with trying to call every single word phrase that Brett Kavanaugh use\nMeanwhile there's these glaring contradictions that you know Christine for you know has made here in in her testimony according to this this ah ex boyfriend rubbers you know they should be examining that just as they should be scrutinizing that just as much as their scrutinizing everything Brett Kavanaugh have to say\nYou know I saw a new twist and I call you'll have to be watching for you know the the FBI's review or their for their background check I think is the way they're describing was delivered to the White House so short time ago today they expected a copy of it will be sent over to Capitol Hill here shortly but then I just saw Richard Blumenthal the man who himself\nAnd then you know the senator Who Lied about his service in Vietnam he had said that he served\nYou just saw Richard Blumenthal the man who himself\nYou know the senator Who Lied about his service in Vietnam he had said that he served in Vietnam during the war he did not in fact serve in Vietnam during the war he lied about his service he's now on suggesting that he's read the other six background checks there were ... done on judge Kavanaugh\nEnded their full of other reasons to question whether or not they should vote on this\nDo you think Mitch McConnell is going to get to a vote this week and do you think this justice is going to be confirmed\nWell yeah I think it's it's it was only a new twist and turn every every day with the story made that's it you never know what what what they're going to come up with next but uh\nI mean it's really everyone's watching you know of course Collins Murkowski flake there the the undecided vote see are so I mean you know Richard Blumenthal and the rest of the Democrats are already said hey we are not only for this guy and a lot of what\nSo uh you know they're not really a ... the votes matter here so uh you know we will see in according to people like Jeff Flake they kinda just they want to see the ... or ... assuming they are comfortable with it they they seem like they would be ready to vote for him\nBiological male students who now dress and called themselves by female names\nAllowing those transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice led to the sexual assault of a five year old girl the investigation is happening in Decatur, Georgia which opened last month signals a major development in the education secretaries policies on transgender bathroom access Betsy devise\nHas handled things differently than the previous administration the complaint alleges that the girl was assaulted in the girl's bathroom at ... elementary school by a boy who is identified as and this is where these things get even stranger he's identified as gender fluid\nWhich means he could be male he could be female he may decide from time to time that he's a boy and he may decide from time to time that he's a girl\nThe complaint was filed in may with the help of the alliance defending freedom which is a conservative group is filed many lawsuits challenging school district transgender bathroom policies nationwide\nAnd I would tell you that over the last two years probably the suspect the subject\nThat has generated the greatest number of emails the greatest number of tweets the greatest number of Facebook post directed to me has been about this subject\nBecause so many parents out there to look at the policies and they say you are creating a situation that is at best uncomfortable for my daughter or son at worst it puts them at physical risk of harm\nUnderstand what's happening target the big retail store got all kinds of heat and probably deservedly so because they said we're going to honor transgender policies and our bathrooms in other words\nA man who dresses as a woman and calls himself a woman and says he identifies as a woman is free to use the ladies' room and the target stores as I said at best that situation if everyone behaves themselves is at best uncomfortable for some people\nBecause you could imagine when a mother is going shopping at target takes her little daughter into the ladies' room and see someone who is clearly not a lady is a man and his using the restroom that's going to be an uncomfortable situation\nAt worst it may provide an opportunity for people who are up to no good to use that kind of access to sexually access or to molest or at at the very least to harass little girls and that's wrong\nNow from the email files today by the way the email address is talk of Lars Larson dot com pat pond says Lars turnabout fair play is there any way the Democrats can be investigated with the same gusto\nThat they're having judge Kavanaugh investigate I bet it would change their tune real quick there is plenty that they are being investigated for right now including Dianne Feinstein I think totally illegitimate decision to hold back information from that Senate Judiciary committee for months\nUntil she finally dropped dead at the last minute that was the accusation by Christine forward against Brett Kavanaugh\nDianne Feinstein knew about it she kept it close to the vest she agreed that she was going to allow this to be an anonymous accusation against Brett Kavanaugh which flies in the face of almost everything we know\nThat she was going to allow this to be an anonymous accusation against Brett Kavanaugh which flies in the face of almost everything we know about how we

go to Capitol Hill they're going to take a look at it tomorrow Mitch McConnell already says there will be a vote on friday or Saturday\nAbout the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh and where does that leave our friends in the Democratic party well it leaves them kind of grasping at straws\nThere are saying well some of us should read the other six background checks done on judge Brett Kavanaugh all of which clear to him for the high level government jobs he had to places like the White House and on the federal court of appeals one of the most sensitive positions in America\nAnd they're they're combing through those things you know if they can find some other kind of dirt that they can swing a judge Kavanaugh and I think the Democrats realized there quickly being made to look like fools they don't have anything to depend on the now well\nThey're saying that previous background checks may show inappropriate behavior they will smear this man no matter what\nNow well they're saying that previous background checks may show inappropriate behavior they will smear this man no matter what\nYou know this is one of those situations where the bit into a situation and they didn't know exactly what what the what they were going to get\nWhat they got was they had hoped they would scare Brett Kavanaugh into withdrawing his own name or Donald Trump into withdrawing his name for him and they didn't get that so they had to stick with it they say we know is there as I told you\nTo some extent they seem like that young boy who always wanted his former dad to give him a pony\nAnd on a couple of nights before Christmas Eve the farmer has a big pile of my newer delivered to the front driveway of the farm and on Christmas morning the farmer walks out and he sees a little boy on top of the manure pile and he's got to shovel and his ... and he's digging with all his might\nAnd when his dad says what are you doing out there he says that I Know there's a pony in here somewhere\nNow the Democrats haven't found the pony yet but there sure are going to try no matter what it costs them\nAnd of course Brett Kavanaugh and his reputation we've got other things to talk about those two and all and Voyager calls on any of those\nMouth towards helped me to me just a scandal one short then he said that right so until he saw it again\nShe pointed or black guy and then ... helped me\nThen it

apparently killed one cop and a wounded at least for others will get you details as\nThey're available but this is now happen sometime ago about an hour ago\nThat we got word he was in custody and the CNN of course is calling them a shooter and not a killer but it appears that he is a cop killer and perhaps well we can just say a prayer for the other police officers were wounded in that I mentioned a moment ago uh the emergency presidential alert system was tested today\nAnd I got that message and it kinda reminded me that uh uh about a year ago I was on a flight to Washington DC and with my producer\nAnd we're on a regular commercial flight we're sitting back and coach where we usually are and uh and I we we were sitting there on the runway and the pilots said we've got a ground stop we can't move the plane to the gate and unload all you folks because we've got a thunderstorm going on and right before\nAll the rain and the wind and the lightning and thunder rolled over the top of that plane\nI saw something I'd never seen before\nYou know usually when you land in a plane people pull out their cell phone and they called the person who's going to pick 'em up the airport or they call their sweetheart like I Do and\nTell Tina that I'm safely on the ground every single phone\nIn that plane lit up at the same instance split up and began ringing all the same time we all ...\nThe ... conference we had here in Seattle, Washington I was at the gate choir summit and there was about a thousand of us gathered in the room and an\nEleven eight team Pacific time when the alert came through we were watching that alert of light up everyone's\nPhone that we had everyone stand up it would kind of a fun little moment though it was an interesting experiment it was a great use of technology was kind of we we're not sure how would play out would it be on time with everybody receive him at the same time\nAnd for the most part you just heard sample set up about a thousand and you can watch the video on my Twitter feed a ... Brian Westbrook you it was really funny just to watch everybody stand up and within about a minute I Would say uh everyone received the alert\nA and it looked like most everyone in the room received that we didn't see a whole lot of people that didn't I think some people were buried in their work or checking their email and not paying attention to us on stage but other than that everybody seemed to receive the alert and seemed to receive in this case not very important information it was just a a test message no acts and required\nA and then I made that joke earlier today I said a pleased now everybody let's not hit reply all [laughter]\nI think I Would just be of course not only can you not reply to this message which I think some folks would would love to be able to reply to a presidential text message but you also cannot unsubscribe unlike the thunderstorm warning that you talked about you can opt out of those you can also opt out of amber alerts you cannot however\nAnd and I think rightly so opt out of presidential alerts there is a threshold you're not going to be hearing political messages they tell us these are for extreme cases a major natural disasters nuclear attack\nThat sort of thing hopefully we never receive another one of these but that system is in place and it seems like any way it worked for the most part I've been tracking a couple of isolated incidents where phones stopped working for some period of time\nUh obviously there's gonna be some bugs and the software is going to need to be improved but generally speaking it sounds like everything was successful\nAs long as you're in the modern era now Brian I did get an email from a guy who's a regular email or I got about nine hundred thousand emails a day and this man emails from time to time I recognize who's handle and he wrote to me and said did I didn't get the message but all my co workers and I said\nThis or you have an older phone don't you\nAnd he may have been one of those guys like my father in law was until recently who stuck with who's tried and true flip phone and he wasn't going to give it on and on my father in law finally gave it up and he seems to be enjoying it\nUh it but this guy said then I said well you just need to get a new phone how old do you have any idea how old the phone would have to be that it wouldn't get that message\nAnd actually doesn't have to be that old I think I think and I'm ... I'm just making this up but I have in my head that it's about five years old if you have a phone that that old\nYou may not be able to receive these messages because of course the software has to be built into the phone but if you have an Android or an Iowa phone of really any generation like any recent generation if it's currently supported you'll definitely have access to this feature a so you're talking about folks that\nDon't have smartphones or have phones that are so old they're not being supportive and they're not being updated since this technology was rolled out a number of years ago\nA and I also want to say that in some states you can be in areas where you just won't receive a signal or the ...\nThere were a lot of folks joking earlier on social media today that if you put your phone in airplane mode well then you won't received a message either so\nThere are different cases where you wouldn't received a message but I gotta say if I'm near anyone at all unless I have my head in the sand or I'm Out on a remote island I Will hear about is whether it's not for myself it's from the Ninety percent or Ninety five Ninety nine percent of the people in the room that do get the alert hopefully one of them will tell me to take\nI Will hear about this weather it's not for myself it's from the Ninety percent or Ninety five or Ninety nine percent of the people in the room that do get the alert hopefully one of them will tell me to take cover up necessary\nHey let me ask you about something you know we're doing to the point when when there was wife I was first available a lot of hotels always charge for these days why fight is becoming like color t._v. and electric lights\nEvery every hotel is giving at least some level of service airplanes are on their way to doing that in fact there's a new a new satellite system that I understand it's going to go up seven or eight hundred satellites are going to get launched\nWhere they say that stuff's going to go right to airplanes and at some point probably airplane why will become at least at the basic level will be a a regular part of the service if we had been hooked up to air airplane why fi I use it occasionally to work while I'm flying from coast to coast would I've got the signal then\nI Believe so and it was I actually talked to a friend of mine who's a flight attendant for one of the major carriers and he said he learned today and and he thought I was surprised to learn you weren't really surprised that over half the plane had not with their phones in airplane mode\nAnd I went on\nDuring the flight I don't I don't know for sure if he was connected to why if I if they were on the ground or or or low enough that they were able to pick up sites that goes but I thought that was kind of funny little anecdote out about these emergency alerts as we know which ones have you have your phone on silent and still receive the alert I imagine that was a little bit of chaos on the airplane\nHey let me ask you this ... there was a big alert about Facebook and cybersecurity is this what should people do about this\nWell there's been some advice floating around and I I've actually subscribe to this for some time that you should not use Facebook to sign into other websites and here's why because you're putting all of your eggs in Facebook's basket if you will you're trusting them to rent to keep your information safe and to keep your sign in and your long and secure\nAnd unfortunately they've shown us recently that they may not be the best equipped to do that or they may not be doing as good a job of keeping your information secure ah with with some fifty million accounts being compromised we don't know if they have access to the third party sites when you use Facebook to sign into another site\nAnd that's actually even more troubling in my opinion than than them being able to say yes you are compromised the fact that they just don't know it's a little scary so my advice would be this using email to sign up creating unique password for every site and if you say to me ... and I know you're going to well that's a pain I Can't\nRun on oh no I use I use different logging names and and and I do use for everything I Try and all and unique\nAnd you should and if you do if you're not as diligent as lawyers or myself what you do is you sign up for one of these password manager is like one pass or even use your operating system to do it for you take the heavy lifting off you but if you're not using unique user names and passwords for every ... Iran as soon as I have access to your\nUh you know mom and pop a online shopping by compromise that information I now have access to your bank I now have access to your social media profiles your email everything\nThe idea of removing him whatever they found if he were confirmed and then at some point next year or something comes up and we say wow the guy really was a bad guy\nIt would have to be something so bad that you would get well until\nUntil the until and unless the Democrats have a majority in both the house and the Senate is not going to happen period and even if they did get a majority in in both house and Senate\nThe idea that you get enough Democrats who would say whatever it is that he is said to have done ten or twenty or thirty or almost forty years ago is bad enough that we should remove him\nExtremely unlikely very very unlikely that answer your question\n[noise] well it does um but my main concern is um you know all this came up what was the week before his final confirmation you know\nIt didn't it came up in July and then a Democrat Senator by the name of Feinstein or as the president culture Feinstein or decided to sit on the information and I think that was a calculated move\nBecause she thought if I bring this up in July we would they would have routinely asked him about it behind closed doors and said did you ever sexually assault this woman she says you did\nAnd he would have said no and that might have been the end of it at that point the Democrats could have decided to go for the Hail Mary pass and say we're going to ask him about it in public under oath and they could have asked him again they could have had it invests\nMary pass and say we're going to ask him about it in public under oath and they could have asked him again they could have had it investigated just as the FBI's looked into additional facts over the last few days\nAnd the same result would have happened and instead they thought and I'm telling you I I can ... I Would bet money\nThat this is what they did this is what Feinstein did she said I'm going to hold this information I'm gonna wait as she did until all of the hearings are over our opportunities to officially ask him about it and have all been gone by and we're about to vote they were within days of the vote\nAnd then I'm going to drop this bomb\nAnd what they've become accustomed to is this kind of guerilla warfare this blitzkrieg approach where you say if we drop a big enough nasty in a sex bomb on Brett Kavanaugh\nEither he will decide to withdraw his own name saying I don't want to drag my family and myself through that or the president will look at it and say wow I'm not going to stand up for that I I Know this is going to be a rough go so the president withdraws his name or Kavanaugh was draws his name he was basically a giant bluff\nLike playing poker you you you don't have any cards in your hand you shut your whole pile of chips into the middle and you hope that everybody else at the table says wow you know Kyle must have a a one heck of a hand he's gotta\nHe's got a royal flush or he's got something special in that hand and they all cave in what they didn't count on\nIs that we have a different America today at least for some people we have a president with a backbone who doesn't take Bernie Sanders lightly\nAnd we have people like judge Kavanaugh who do not take this stuff and just immediately cave in now you and I both know there are plenty of Democrats who cave easily and there are plenty of rhino Republicans bouquet Beasley they were counting on a cave in so that they never have to actually prove\nThat they had a hand that they had a you know the four of a kind or something and it didn't work and now they don't know what to do and they're trying to ... they're they're trying to salvage this\nLike just to clarify for it actually came out with us ally and the Democrats saying well\nNot came out with ... anonymously made the complaint to her rap or member of Congress who brought it to Feinstein and then they sat on it they did not ask the FBI\nWhat tiny July, July yeah\nOkay that's that's life also ... ... you know what I mean\nThey sat on it yet and at any given anything about it is that's the problem it is it's real politic and it and say why it not only in say Israel\nAs soon as I was off\nRight and imagine this but if what

school about forty years ago and everybody would which was in the dark I Do the late Nineteen seventies where the tail end of Jimmy Carter's Virgil recession and things were looking kind of bleak before Ronald Reagan came in\nBut I remember almost every one I knew in school couldn't wait to move out of mom and dad's house and strike out on their own weather was to college or a job get their own apartment pay their own bills be responsible for themselves\nWhat's happened between then and now that has millennials say\nA word we don't want to move out of mom and dad's house and by the way we'd like the government to pay our bills for us in a socialist setting\n[noise] well a lot has happened uh the government has grown enormously not just in spending and regulation but in debt and the opportunities that\nThe millennial generation face had been greatly reduced or as a result there they've come to become somewhat cynical a understandably and we have found that according to\nThe major surveys of millennials which includes the work of Pew Research center and the Harvard Institute of politics\nThat millennials have a landed on especially five questions um because they feel constrained with little opportunity and the five questions are how they can\nPay off their student loan debt how can make it a good job how come they ever afford a house how can they afford healthcare that that that is going to be right for them and why is the government spying on them\nAnd [noise] the results of this is a millennials have lost confidence in sort of the American system\nUm and ah David looking around for answers but they don't know who to trust\nSo the uh of course millennials were not around pretty much during the Cold War they didn't know about the reality of socialism\nIn the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc and so forth and even in China in some respects so to them the idea is how do they make ends meet and uh as human beings they're open to getting free stuff [noise]\nSo the other factor that came into play was they are coming out of the uh the public school system and out of college as a base of the narrative taught as the progressive narrative that government just solution to everything\nAnd they believe that they've been taught to believe that the the two thousand eight\nRecession the great recession was caused by capitalism and free markets in other words that greed drove this problem and as a result\nThe American system bailed out people who are responsible for it even though the reality of it is that it was federal policies that created the bubble and then the bailout just made it a continuous actually\nUh instead of having the economy it correctly adjust to the problem so what we found was there's an opportunity actually to reach millennials\nMillennia the mental generation is the largest generation American history\nIt's an opportunity actually to reach millennials ... it'll generation has the largest generation American history\nIt's about eighty three million Americans and since they don't watch the six o'clock news they don't read the newspaper or magazines they get most of their information from YouTube as far as news and entertainment\nSo we developed a video series to target and when he holds a not so much a series of videos that is preaching to them about what to think but more of a story\nThat especially if features millennials figuring out these five questions and it's funny it's a satire and I'm the first season of it ah the series is called love of\nA has reached over eight point two million combining views on YouTube we've just release the second season about a week ago and it's similar to the sky rocket up and we're we target mainstream millennials in the process\nAnd the results of this is I'm young people seeing through the the narrative the progressive narrative and also the view that they can get something for nothing\nIs there a possibility that we could go back and reach his on this all sounds great and I'd like to help you know remind people of it and have them pass it on can we go back to some of the kids as early as high school\nAnd persuade them that they're being sold a bill of goods when they're told that all of you should go to college and I think that's that's a real mistake\nBecause teachers Bush should because they are largely college educated married to other college educated professionals usually and then they tell their students who is the only way to go college and what we have is a college degree is diminishing value in part because so many people have them they used to be a relatively rare thing\nAnd I've talked to a ... said\nRealistically what percentage of of workers in a society like ours should have degrees and they say you know twenty eight maybe twenty eight percent most ... thirty at the top and the other Seventy percent should have some skills and training but not for years of college that ends up being worth\nAs you point out the reason they have a tough time paying for their college is they find out it doesn't enhance your earning ability enough to even pay for itself\nIt'd be like buying a machine that produces ten dollar a gallon gasoline you say well what am I going to do with that I can you know I ... I I'm paying a bunch of money for a machine that makes gasoline that's more expensive than the gas something I can buy at the palm why would I Do that\nWhy would I buy a college degree that cause a hundred thousand dollars that you know boosts my pay by three dollars an hour it'll take me the most of my life to pay for it\nAnd that doesn't make sense and and get I get to them early\nIn the escalation of college tuition costs\nHas gone up I don't have the numbers in front of me but a a huge\nThe largely um increase over any other major factor that people are facing as far as cost and the pay is of course enormous as you mentioned over time with the student loan debt problem [noise]\nAh what Obama did was he nationalize the student loan programs of believe it or not in the Obamacare measure\nI'm part of the reason they did that was because uh they actually viewed Obamacare is a way to appeal to young people and get them to become dependent on the federal government and hence the keep voting them in a for other various ... century measures\nBut you're right it's it's a great distortion and uh the dumbing down of the standards of of universities in college\nA ... century measures but you're right it it it's a great distortion and\nUh the dumbing down of the standards of of universities and colleges is enormous I'm most colleges in not just the so called grievance studies of gender race and so forth but also in many of the social sciences has been taken over by\nA sort of a cultural Marxist view um that really doesn't educate people miss educate people so that's part of the story of the love of series is is college where the worth it and if it is why it's worth it and how\nTo change that ah how do you see through the the the the false narrative that people are being given\nBut the nice thing about the love of series is that is funny and is enjoyable and us millennials figuring out these questions\nIn their lives um the story essentially is of a young woman in college\nStick your head in the sand and saying that you know by passing laws all of a sudden because they're going to vanish but rather let's let's get more with us ... says the street because the only thing that criminals listen to the only language that they understand it's a good guy with a guy\nThat's right and and I was going to say that if you go back I think it's to maybe Nineteen eighty was the number of guns in private possession closer to two hundred million in about Nineteen eighty so we come home come forward\nOr not quite forty years and we have doubled the number of guns in private possession in America which by the anti gunners logic\nIf you double the number of guns you're gonna see twice as much violent crime or or maybe more so and instead we've seen a drop over the last thirty or forty years in violent crime in this country so the evidence the evidence of the number is is that more guns in in the hands of law abiding citizens means dramatically less crime\nYou're exactly right liars and and and the thing to remember is that almost any statistic that you look at for example ... New York times for\nTheir own report they talked about two thousand Seventeen there were a Lebanese thousand people murdered bright by criminals with guards in that\nSame year at the FBI came out now granted these are very conservative FBI numbers they stayed at a hundred and twelve thousand\nOr non police individuals defended their lives with guys now if you look at research by Dr Gary collectors they're significantly even more but even those ultra conservative numbers ten times\n... times more good things happen with guns and bad taste\nYeah and and and I guess this this is just that if we could get even more guns if we made government policies more friendly toward people having conceal carry I mean Tim you know I make a nice living you make a nice living if I I bought a new walther pistol last week\nUh I have a number of pistols but what I Wonder about is the ability of the average person out there who lives in a place like California where they make it very expensive\nTo be able to get a permit even Nevada makes it a little bit ridiculous because\nYou have to take classes and you have to do this and you have to do that by the time you're all done\nAn average person might have to drop a thousand dollars all totaled to be able to have the permit have\nThe gun practice and and be properly equipped to do that well for an awful lot of wage earners a thousand dollars of discretionary income is is a big chunk of the family's budget over even a couple of years even though it is is great security but if you can afford it\nAllows I couldn't agree more I mean the fact\nThat if you have to spend that much money to exercise natural or like\nI eat the permits and all that stuff that's that's just wrong especially in the United states of America we're in our country is is based on the concept of of a personal freedoms and sudden another point the ironic thing is that the cities and states that have the highest levels of crime or the areas where\nThe toughest for the the law abiding citizens to get the guys and and that's I mean to me that's a travesty\nAnd I know that because I have a nice income actually kind of live in a Heinz fifty seven neighborhood they're nice houses in there and not so nice as their houses and ... D nicer there my house and their houses that are not as nice and I think these are people who work hard for you know to make their living\nAnd ah and they should have the same kind of protection I Do even though if you live in a nice neighborhood\nYou're ... you're a lot less likely to fall victim to a crime the ugly truth is that most criminals are poor and most criminals prey on the poor people around them in poor neighborhoods and you know the the stance bear that out so if you say you know if we could make it easier and say that the\nAnd the poor people around them in poor neighborhoods and you know that the stats bear that out so if you say you know if we could make it easier and say that the government says we'll waive the fee for getting a concealed carry permit\nIf you have an income below such and such not give them any money but just say\nIf you want to get the permit man you're below a certain income you know we we give out free cheese we give out food stamp all these other things how 'bout waving the fee for concealed carry permits for people below say below the average uh in in income and make it easier for them to do it and put the fear of God in all the criminals out there\n[noise] yeah well well you're exactly right because that is the only thing that puts your daughter criminals that is a a a an affirmative\nViolent response that's what they're afraid of and the good news I mean that's an interesting state and you put it Lars but the good news is that there's many states that are actually going in that direction but even more broader lay in the sense of ... will carry so right now we have twelve states\n... states that have pretty much said All right we trust our citizens to carry goes you don't have to ask for a permit you don't have to ask us if we can defend ourselves and I personally think that's fair\nTo I Love it it's constitutional carry now imagine what would happen in Chicago if they tried that experiment but I Know that rama manual in his crowd would not go for Tim where can people find the U.
