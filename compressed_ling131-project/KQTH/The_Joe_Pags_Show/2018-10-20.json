right but for now here's moral wires worst one on one oh four one K. cutie [noise] Rio\nLawyers who are welcome\nBack to the Lars Larson show well I started tonight with the caravan was headed toward the Mexico Guatemala border and I told you this is an important issue but it's been an important issue for a couple of decades long before President Trump used it\nUp on immigration is that even possible for Donald Trump to get tougher on immigration then he's been one\n[noise] but that's a great question uh you know the answer is no but it allows him to return an issue that has really been in the headlines recently\nAnd so whether or not he's ramping it up I guess it ... it but it hasn't been in the headlines and now it is and so the care of and it's kind of given him an opportunity to kind of low hanging fruit at the softball and uh and he thinks that he's just going to hit it hit it out of the car right ahead of these midterm elections\nSo your your point is well made a he has ramped up really anything it's the same position that he had all along or but it doesn't allow him to uh to to re enter this into the news cycle at a very crucial\nWell maybe maybe if Nancy Pelosi goods conspiratorial she could say Donald Trump or rain for the caravan to arrive at precisely the right moment before the mid term so that he could bring it back up using tree can launch conspiracy theory like that\nI was I think she could probably drink something like that I thought you know right now you get a lot of finger pointing across the aisle Trump of course is blaming the Democrats for allowing the caravan to come up and the Democrats appointed right back across at him and saying wait a minute we don't control the government wants to do something about the conditions down there\nAh in in Central America so of course it's going to be a blame game this is immigration in Washington and a ... and the fingers are going to be pointing all around and and that has to change the course just a a headed these elections it's only going to get a more heated\nWell Mike let me ask you this and this may sound a little crazy but I'll I'll throw it out you anyway or is it possible since we now live in a world where anybody with a smartphone anywhere on the planet knows can know what's going on in another country\nIs it possible this caravan shows precisely this moment because it is around the midterms not because they wanted to help their friends and the Democratic party but because they thought it's time to get into your into the United states before we hit those midterms in ... season changes\n[noise] well you know I think if if they were if they were thinking that that politically\nI think that they would have I think they would have waited as you know with the house a kind of favorite to flip to the Democrats right now I think they would think that I have a better chance of getting across later in the year or next year or if the Democrats and below sea do take the gavel I you know I think\nUh you you talked to at least you talk to the advocates and you talk to the diplomats down there\nAnd there is a lot of violence that there are people legitimately fleeing\nA very dire situation and and and then of course they're going to be a lot of hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of that situation get across the border\nWhen in fact they are probably not in any jeopardy but a ... you talked to the at least the advocates and those on the ground down there and they think that uh you know this wouldn't have nothing to do with politics that if it did\nThat they would certainly wait until next year a assuming that the that the house would flip\nWell the other thing about that is that do I understand correctly 'cause I I Do keep an eye on this topic is one of my favorite for the last Twenty years is one that we ought to resolve that ah\nThat the ... ... if you say I'm coming from a country where I'm being persecuted by the government because of my race religion or national origin or any of the other protected categories that you have a good chance of being approved\nAs a refugee on the other hand about eighty five percent of refugee claims are refused because people say my country has a stinky economy or my country has you know crime problems\nThat those under the law or not legitimate reasons claim refugee status\nAnd certainly yes you're exactly right and you and is that and there are going to be a vote of course you know people are going to get to the border and and\nStatus and certainly yes you're exactly right and is that and there are going to be both of course you know people are going to get to the border and and saw him again or probably in a very dire situation uh you know whether it's gang violence\nOr domestic abuse or or whatever the the situation is they're legitimate claims and those people\nAre by and large are are approved after they go through the process then again you're going to have the hangers on who are just trying to take advantage of a of a of an opportunity here\nAnd uh you know to to claim that poverty is a reason to seek a asylum status or refugee status or of course it's no judge appears willing to accept that and those people will probably be refused and deport it um but you're certainly right you know the the the ... broader point\nThat we do have a process in place that uh that once people do arrive at the border there's a process that detain\nA and they have to go before a judge before anything can happen and uh you know what the Trump Administration is trying to prevent that from happening at all\nBy having Mexico where somebody Central American government stop the caravan before it even gets to the border so that's kind of where we are right now the negotiation with the Mexican\nA law makers Mexican leaders Mexican authorities and uh there was some rumbling yesterday that a Mexican leaders had said that they would take care of it before they reached the border so this might fizzle out or\nBefore they even get to Texas or anywhere on the southern border but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out\nI'm Talking to my littlest who writes for the old dog come down to the other piece of this and I want to know if I'm over ... I Am a Trump fan but when the caravan started and it was maybe a thousand before grew to four thousand is it is now may be even bigger than that by now\nOr the president said to Honduras pull that caravan back or you lose your foreign aid\nHe told the same to Guatemala and then he told Mexico you let those folks across and you may find yourself without a trade deal now I was guessing that does seem to be some pretty powerful motivating pushes from the president is that the reason that Mexico isn't just opening up the gate and letting them come into Mexico and then head up the road toward America\nWell actually what Mexico is doing is offering work visas to a lot of these people say you know all these countries have\nDifferent relationships and they have different laws and processes that would a company you know people who wanted to to leave or enter a a a a sovereign country um you know the Guatemalan government can't very well tell its citizens that they can't travel outside of the country so\nI don't know what legal authority they would have to do so and then in ... Mexico I'm sure it has some kind of visa agreement with all of the Central American countries and is probably very lenient and there's probably this probably very easy to come and go so what we were hearing yesterday is that the Mexican government was going to offer some work visas and try to get\nA those people to stay in Mexico and not ... not reached the border as a kind of an appeasement strategy for Trump because he is threatening\nTo close the border he was threatening to put military force at the border and he was a threatening describe most importantly is threatening to scrap\nThe newly a negotiated NAFTA deal and of course Mexico a doesn't want any of those things to happen so I I think they're scrambling they're they're trying to figure out a way to a to a peace President Trump and prevent uh this caravan for rich and the border\nHey Mike this is the first time I can remember any American president Republican or Democrat doing that kind of thing telling Mexico knock it off and help us out or you're going to you're going to suffer can you think of another example where president has done that\nI can now and you know and you don't have to go back very far to remember you know who remember the search at the border we talked about under President Obama I'm ... and there were just you know thousands and thousands of people and and and a lot of them unaccompanied minors that was when that first started happening or as a result of a lot of the gang\nSpouses and thousands of people and and a lot of them unaccompanied minors that was when that first started happening or as a result of a lot of the gang the escalation of gang violence down there with the recorded reason\nAnd uh but I Know President Trump wasn't you know pressing those governments to stop the people before they arrived he was just scrambling to find ways to process them once they did\nAnd of course that's why you had all these detention centers uh you know President Obama long before President Trump had entered centers or what he didn't do a separate the families which I think that's why that issue blew up\nUm but you know you hear about immigration judges and the the lack of immigration judges and these people get up here in the months or even years sometimes waiting it'd be profit\nAnd so it's it's just a bottleneck backlogs and a ... I was just a mess when that's when I served like that happened but uh to your point no I've never heard of a a president at least in modern history\nYou are allowed to access all of America's social service programs so welfare food stamps tan of a section eight housing Medicaid all the rest of that\nOr ... social service programs so welfare food stamps ten of a section eight housing Medicaid all the rest of that so it's a sweet deal if you can get it as a refugee you could work\nAnd make them far more money than you made back at home you can be reasonably save at least compared to back home your kids get to go to school you get medical care and you can access all those free goodies paid for by the American taxpayer and if anybody thinks that to write\nOr fair or just or legal\nI think you've got to take another look at the wall let's go to norm norm welcomed along to the Lars Larson show what's on your mind\nYeah ... ... ... ... a gallon for her that's\nJamal ... yeah\nYeah he he ... you know he's an Arab here are they going to guard like anybody else that they'll let it go through\nThe air show they did it any more than it is in her home and he got killed by well\n... I can tell you one if you want me to make the argument for why it should be a story\nIf somebody I went to the American consulate in Russia or Japan or France\nAnd they ended up murdered inside that consulate\nAnd it's a conflict that say from a friendly country a or a country added to lease to sensibly an ally of the United states\nThat would be in it that would be a major story that's not just some foreign national who's gone home and and goes to an M ... and goes out and gets killed in a mugging or a of a crime of some kind this is somebody who was allegedly killed in an embassy now I Believe\nThat his murder may be more the result of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood the fact that uh he was a friend of Osama bin Laden and that he identified where they you know the the ridiculous ... end of Islam and that had more to do with it and the fact that MBBS the guy who runs the crown prince who runs Saudi Arabia right now\nIs trying to westernize their country and the ... folks the hardcore is llamas do not want that to happen I think that may be more to explain why he ended up dead\nThen the Saudi Government just simply saying we're going to silence a critic by murdering him but he wasn't just a journalist he was a political actor as well\nAnd for the most part I understand our media tell them tends to tilt to the left but we said tell to the left\nImagine somebody who worked for a ... one of these dug huge crowds a drop in American cities re also worked for a major newspaper or a major news organization like CNN and they played both roles the role of being a political activist\nAs well as the role of being a journalist on television most television ads it's even the folks at the chicken noodle news network would not tolerate\nHaving somebody on they'll do it for commentators\nBut they will not do it for somebody who's straight ahead news reporter which is what ... is being presented to Americans and all these stories as but he was a political actor I mean if you said I have a job with the Democratic National Committee\nAs one of their staffers but I'm also working as a journalist at CNN CNN would say no we're not going to let that happen unless you're on as a commentator but if you're just simply a news reporter so what they're trying to portray this as is\nThis man was a journalist he wanted to tell the truth about Saudi Arabia and he was murdered for being a good journalists I have a feeling that when we finally find out the details that we're going to find out that he was also a\nFor being a good journalist I have a feeling that when we finally find out the details that we're going to find out that he was also a political actor and he was pushing a narrative that was\nAnti Saudi Government right now because he wants to the Saudi Government go back to the other direction this the ... that country while they've not always been the best friend they have been an allied to the United states\nAnd I think what the left would like to do are left would like to do is drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Washington DC\nAnd the fact is whether you like it or not if we're going to be an actor in that region and we do have to because that region could end up being a national security threat to our country we need some allies there we have one in uh in Israel\nWe could have had one in Iraq but we let everything fall apart when Obama pulled all the troops out and now we've got troops back in there but that could have been a a a a freely elected a government with the constitution was written while we were still there\nWe haven't done that and we could have had one in Saudi Arabia and one is that region started to have real you know government of the people instead of government is being run by either dictators or royal families\nThen when you got one next door you say well why can't our country like Iran why can't we have one that's more responsive\nTo the public they don't right now but they could and the minute you get one next door you're going to say well hey why can't we have a deal like that\nAnd I think the Islamic hardliners [noise] they don't want that to happen and they'll kill anybody in a way of stopping that\nYou've got the Lars Larson show [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWe're heading into the final chapter of the great American read on PBS PBS asked you to pick your number one book from

I'm In charge in China a larger rates which is what they may in fact eventually be doing as the consequences of this administration's a decision on this fight 'em there's sort of signal the scent of wanting to China or that that they may do that and that's\nBasically what the ... to do so if if the question is can we get more money coming into the U.S postal service that's actually a viable question and something that they may actually be looking to do with later on down the line\nBut this also has implications for well I I guess for the way they're trying to compete for the United states because as I understand it\nThe UP you this is the United nations agency a says we're going to allow a flat rate for packages up to four point four pounds so if somebody goes on Amazon and buys something from China\nAnd you know buy something and whether they know it's coming from China or not it shipped from China you have the packages for point four pounds that's two kilos or less uh then they get charged a flat rate\nAnd that that allows foreign companies to undercut us competitors who have to pay market rate well at least if they're sending things by FedEx or UPS or the other carriers in this country they pay market rate\nUm shouldn't shouldn't we did this does having an implication for people buying things because if you find all of a sudden\nThat you're going to have to pay more to ship things if they're coming from China that might actually make American goods are good from other places competitive where they're not today and the only difference could be the shipping cause right\nThat's exactly that's exactly it and I believe that sort of the angles the administration is looking at him into a lot of business organizations in the U.S have been making you know precisely that argument that you know it's just simply unfairly trying to be able to do it this way and we need to do something differently\nAnd a lot of them are very pleased with the administration is is you know picking up the ah the baton on this for like ...\nI guess I'm In ... and the implications for the postal service I mean I don't know how many packages coming from China but given the volume that Amazon is selling I've a feeling it's probably a lot and if you you know if every one of them cause another dollar a dollar and a half to ship\nA that would not only have implications for U.S companies that are trying to sell to American consumers but it would it have an ... an implication for the postal service to you have all of a sudden the rates went up to something that's more like a market rate and they were a bit higher on a few tens of millions of packages\nThat could make a big difference\nNuts is that now you're exactly right on that point it could it could make a substantial difference I mean part of the thing well what's interesting about the Trump Administration is that they are basically sort of turning over all these rocks hum of\nIssues that people have looked at her thought about in a long time and forcing people to you know to to deal with them and says well this is again is another one of those sort of interesting cases where they're doing that where they're forcing because this has been something that's been going on in the sort of process has been for decades and then the first one to say hey wait a minute why are we doing it this way maybe we should do a different way and that's one of the interesting things about the man is racial\nWell especially because and this has gone on from sixty nine to president we've essentially had no no difference in the rates that are being charged flat rates that are being charged for shipping packages is that they use that the case or has there been some kind of inflation escalator and that over the over the last forty or fifty years\nI don't know if it's been I don't know if it's been adjusted for inflation or not I mean there's I Believe the rate has remained the same whether whether that's a you know I I don't actually know the exact mechanism weather works as a percentage or not I'm not sure but the rate has remained consistent whether or not it it's a small percentage of\nYou you sound like you're a bit younger than me but would you like to be paying a for gasoline let's say what you were paying and Nineteen\nSo yeah Shaun you you sound like you're a bit younger than me but\nWould you like to be paying a for gasoline let's say what you were paying in Nineteen sixty that if you were buying gasoline at night I was mowing lawns so I was buying gasoline in Nineteen sixty nine and I know what it costs then and I know what it costs now I'd love to have Nineteen sixty nine gasoline rage or rent\nI remember my parents used by a hundred dollars a month for a very nice house for rent\nAnd and I'd love to be paying a hundred dollars a month to rent an apartment I'll bet a lot of other Americans would do why is it that until we get a real business man in office like Donald Trump\nNobody any of these administrations as a you know Bush or Clinton or or or a bomb or anyone else has said hey maybe we should bring that rate forward why are we still charging the Nineteen sixty nine right\nIt's it's it's that's a good question and the answers that as well so many things is just so much easier to say I find whatever let's let's just let it let it be and move on to something else is somewhat more pressing and just not deal with it I mean there's there's so many sort of things that just haven't been looked at\nHer address talked about in a long time um and this is another one of the sort of issues and there's a lot of things that they brought up in when they were talking about it you know the trade you know the NAFTA deal and other things that people haven't talked about her address in a while and it ... this is in yeah I mean it's the answer your question is\nPeople should have people should have been looking and asking these fundamental questions and there's just that sort of mind set of standards sort of Washington but never really probably to do it and what things about Trump is that he\nDoesn't subscribe to that mindset of me and sometimes he goes a little bit of a off the edge on some areas but other times you know take somebody who thinks that way to sort of a look at these issues and say\nYou know do we really need to do it this way I mean you know that you know the NAFTA negotiations for a good example I mean it's a long time people they're all saying what's going it's working fine we don't need to address distribute to rock the boat and Trump said no I'm going to vote and see what happens yeah that's exactly what he's doing that again with the decision\nWell it it just kind of stuns me because I have a feeling there isn't a company out there in the private sector who doesn't say what do we charging for this\nIs that what our competitors are charging is that what the market will bear and maybe back in Nineteen sixty nine\nI don't know how much stuff was getting shipped from China I mean before uh before next and even sort of open to open up an open China so we had better relations with them I'm not sure how much stuff was getting shipped anyway probably not nearly the volume today but\nI have to imagine somewhere someone deep in the ... the U.S government was looking at that thing that isn't that amazing millions of baggage is coming in from China all of the same rate and isn't that amazing and not thinking for a moment\nI'm I'm all of that as a part of that that um that maintenance backlog\nNow let me ask you this because I'm always want to run the numbers my wife and I buy an annual pass every year and I think it's Seventy five or eighty bucks and there's a very good deal if you're just going to go to one of the parts one time on one day every year I think you pay thirty bucks but if you buy Seventy five or eighty dollar pass and maybe a little bit more now\nThat they would uh you know that that let you go to any national park you want all year long and it's a it's a pretty good deal and I feel\nThat part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they are available to everybody but those of us who want to use the ... pay a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors should pay the entire job nor do I think the taxpayer should pay the whole tab\nIs there a way and I keep wanting twelve billion ... billion a year on top of whatever spending now in the poor maintenance we're doing right now we we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold shoot for be nice to do it in five years instead of ten where you could do that\nHow many people visit all of the national parks in a way that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nIt's that's that's a great question I Know that millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our parks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't you know job or a created an additional burden on the taxpayer and in fact\nThe six point five billion dollars which the legislation proposes um towards is almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from a federal middle revenues and so this is on showing offshore oil and gas so these are things that we um those funds that are already there um but they're not\nEarmark I'm right now for national park to allocate it to other programs but I'm not legislation\nOf federal budget expert either Monica but if they if there's money wasn't going to the park to would go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government buys right\nYeah well the way it is fun\nIt would go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government bars right\nYeah well the way that these funds are I mean what we're proposing is to to reallocate these funds to to the park so it's not necessarily um you know pulling drawing down our adamant increased burden on the taxpayer\nAnd what it does is it is to identifying a pot of money that we haven't thought about that could benefit the national parks and I and I think you know what that does of course is with\nThis um six point six and a half billion dollar looks fun I think on the back and and you know you're talking funding um it's always return on investment right so investing this as a country or what are we going to get back for it and you know to that I Will answer\nMe will will have the you know the statue of liberty I Will be preserved and that has\nA a backlog a maintenance back well right now Ellis Island and we know how important um you know that was a stopping point\nIn our American story um you know that places like the Little Rock Central High school um in in in Arkansas and that is a historic site and brown\nV board of education and that they you know these are the historic places that tell our story and so we have a ... we have places we can go to talk about um who we are as a country and to get to the numbers of things I mean um we um had an analysis done by the cat and his group and they found\nThat if the if this legislation passed it would create a hundred and ten thousand infrastructure related jobs and so that directly impact\nLocally and caught economies at these national\nParks are part of and so I Would say you know by redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment um for with these local communities can get and the job they create um by just restoring um places that we already know hum are important to to who we are as a country\nTo monitor who's opposing it\nUp you know ah right now there's a bipartisan support so it's on on both sides I think right now we're we're trying to get through and we're hoping to get this legislation passed\nIn the next month or two after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and get to work around a around us so we're we're kind of caught into um the the bill is now\nIn the legislation is now in sub committee it's coming out of that soon but we you know or need to the Congress to act right now um to to get this passed for us\nTo do it it's something that they've already got bipartisan support it should be a done deal done is anybody playing politics with those same World War not doing that until you do something else\nYou know I'm ... I'm I Would say I'm I'm sure that that is the case but [laughter] but but I you know I Would also argue that yeah I\nI I'm a big huge preservation is in fact you're of course I work for the national trust 'em you know but you know preservation is a is a bipartisan I'm a you know it's it's good for Republicans and Democrats like it's good sized ...\nWe all care about our heritage are just from

think about an American\nWe've had to fight off enemies of all kinds and in fact America's fought at least a couple of times in the first and Second World war is to be able to keep the country in the world safe\nAnd of course during the Cold War you know the war with no uh no shooting thank goodness we had to fight a quiet late to be able to prevail over an enemy that had vowed to our destruction\nSo the book why we fight by Dr Sebastian Gorka defeating America's enemies with no apologies is very very important as far as I'm concerned Dr ... it's a pleasure to have you back on the program\nThanks for having me alive\nYou begin by saying the apology tour is finally over before we get to what Donald Trump he's doing for America tell us what you think was done in the previous presidents tenure\nWhile the Obama administration made a conscious decision very early on that the the big problems in the world\nAre are America's fault whether it's global warming whether it's terrorism we are really to blame and that's why\nThe first things that President Obama did was to go on the global apology so well that that ended on Saturday to threaten your last year that the previous eight years had seen\nAmerica withdraw from the world\nAnd the bad guys take the front seat whether it's Russia invading the Ukraine whether it's the rise of ISIS whether it's the ... minutes arising sign or whether it's the the the mullahs in Iran getting\nStrengthened by Obama's Iran deal that has been replaced with in America for strategy and that's good for all Americans and it's very good for our partners and allies as well\nI'm anxious to talk about what you think the da dun will Trump is doing I Know I have my own impression but you had the chance to work with him as a as a former assistant to the president but do you have any inkling as to why Americans didn't respond more forcefully\nWhen our previous president a bronco Obama decided that he would simply take America to second or third position and then we would no longer take the kind of preeminent role that we've taken for much of the last hundred years why didn't Americans react more\nI think if the cause we will allow the left take control of the political culture for the last forty years so you know as you think about the fact that the dean\nDo one in ... as a became tenured professors in Chicago after being leaders of the weather and then all of that ground terrorist organized station when you think of the political correct with the map controls Hollywood\nThe major in general academe the press I I think that was a lot of brainwashing after I mean just look at the polls that the victims of communism foundation recently polled millennials and forty two percent of the millennials said they'd like to live in a socialist United States\nSo if you see a Andrew Breitbart was so right if you if you've seen the the cultural uh for rain\nThan politics will follow\nAnd by the way bernadine during and bill airs it's worth noting that Brock Obama launched his campaign from where the fundraiser and to get together at the home of ... who is as you point out a terrorist and and and for some reason\nConnections to other kinds of groups are frequently used uh to to a dam or to slur or a political candidate in that case a his connection to bill layers which continued and he had quite a connection it wasn't just getting together and his home but he had he had quite a few connections to bill\nBill layers which continued and he had quite a connection it wasn't just getting together and his home but he had he had quite a few connections to bill layers in running out one of the ... education foundations that Morocco bomb was involved in before he became a U.S senator and Americans I guess shrug dirt or didn't know or didn't care\n[noise] well I you know I I don't know if they shrugged buildings no didn't care that the media covered it up I mean Obama live he said oh I don't I didn't really know bill as you just live close by that's alive as you stated\nThey were on the board of the same five oh one C. three foundation so when when when you have\nAlmost all the media in your back pocket that you can get away with all kinds of stuff I mean the the ... the ... the media under the Obama years we've never seen anything like it in America before\nI'm Talking to doctors Sebastian Gorka former deputy to the president of the United states Donald Trump his latest book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies\nSo let's talk about this that the left has has painted Donald Trump as a candidate and now still is trying to paint Donald Trump as president as a man who's going to take us into another war well your answer that criticism plays\nA open your eyes every body look around uh\nWe we have North Korea before the president came in to to the oval office continue to build a nuclear capability is legally launching ballistic missiles over the sea of Japan and now off the\nNext five years thanks to Donald Trump we are on the cops that potentially of ending the Korean War not just with an armistice but with a peace treaty\nAnd and just seeing the potential\nDenuclearize patience\nOf the whole peninsula look at look at Russia Russia is back in a box\nThey are trying to destabilize various regions around the world\nBut we have a president who says enough is enough we've even killed three hundred Russian most reason Syria to send a very strong message to Moscow that we will not allow you to destabilize important parts of the world\nAnd in fact today we're seeing a story breaking about possible assassinations by the Russians are by others are on ... in this in this world let me ask you a straight out question Dr Gore got you study this for a long time\nIs it fair to say that probably every one of the countries on this planet or of any size does engage in assassination from time to time not necessarily a political figures but\nPeople are killed who need to be killed to protect our national security you think as much as we might hate to admit it that that that probably does happen and that is not just Russia and China and other countries but we do it as well\nI wouldn't say that the white bread trends but\nIf there are no other options if your cattle extradite international law actually commit this if somebody\nHas committed a terrorist the trust of theories about two and they're on the ... the territory of another country in that country refuses to ... extra die so that you are you permitted by international law to use deadly force against that individual that's one of the principles\nWe use only went off the bin Laden in Afghanistan in October of two thousand to one\nYes I mean if if your national security is in jeopardy you're not going to hold a press conference or or have have negotiations with with a rogue\nWell national security is in jeopardy you're looking to hold a press conference or or have have negotiations with with a rogue regime it it's the survival of the nation may be at stake\nSo tell me that is what do we need to do to really make this country safe and fight back the way you write about\nWell look I I ... in why we fight I go through the country by country threat by threat whether it's trying to whether it's the the hobbies whether it's Russia a first things first we have to rebuild them at a tree we have to note yeah the ... we have to note that\nThat ... many cases you can do what they wish to do to America and then ... and this is why you know the title of the book is why we fight them why have the stories of for American heroes that\nWe have to read this dealt with the will to win because you can have the best\nAnd vote that Donald Trump got in twenty sixteen not quite two years ago and it was eight percent by the middle of last year twenty Seventeen he was at twenty three percent almost three times the number that he got ... votes in the election and this year he's already at thirty six percent\nDoes that kind of grows would make almost anybody in any field very happy and yet the mainstream media and that's on one of the most divisive issues that America is faced and that of race and whether or not a black American citizens feel they're being treated appropriately and equitably [noise]\nIt seems that an awful lot of black Americans are a huge percentage in percentage terms has decided this is the president we like\nTo I think what did we see and twenty sixteen an incredible\nSilent majority the mainstream media that that Hillary has a more than Ninety percent\nOf weddings and posted something like Ninety seven to ... percent salt water ... she lost bottled Trump won I think in the last two years that figure of of silence after ... ... votes as can\nOnly have increased about why I remain very very called for the\nAnd yet the other side and especially the media player in the media is a big player in this seems willing to do almost anything even entertain a lines to win a fight like the fight that occurred over the appointment of justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nYeah I mean in in in my book why we fight I talk about with the famed as wicked chambers was was justice Kavanaugh before dusty capital was even born\nSo you know in Nineteen forty\nEight a man who had been a former communist agents stood up and called the rest of the festival televise the live alone it and told the world who the secret agents were communists inside government including algebra hit or the left tries to destroy him they used to being a homosexual an alcoholic\nOr you know everything you can imagine and it was\nAll live so that the Democrats have made a bargain with the devil the ends justify the means if you were shocked that while they just to Kavanaugh then you need to open a history book because they did it the class Thomas they did it the jobs the jobs are your ... and they did it\nTo a with the chamber's back in Nineteen forty eight\nI'm Talking to doctors Sebastian Gorka who's the author most recently of why we fight 'em before we wrap up this segment because I Want to talk to you about Islam and the next segment um you you you mentioned the the kind of tactics that are willing to use and it strikes me that there are also willing to Tampa very deep double standard just last week\nThere were folks who were I guess for lack of a better term gay shaming a Lindsey Graham ah by suggesting that ah that because he's a you know that that somehow he's he's homosexual\nAnd and that kind of treatment of people ordinarily get you shouted down these days in America if you either decide to out somebody or cast a slur by suggesting that they're gay\nAnd yet the Democrats on the left seem willing to do it and the media seems willing to amplified that as well\nBlog that doesn't get you shouted down it destroys your career if a conservative did to Lindsey Graham was the last ... or if a conservative district called gay west with the left I mean think about it the left on on cable TV called Kanye West\nAs ... ignorance negro anybody on the right path that Korea is would be over the racism homophobia\nIs all the less they lost the great Ira and the book is why we find a ... a former Japanese\nOh I Love about the ...\nThe book is why we find a job through his doctors about Gorka former
