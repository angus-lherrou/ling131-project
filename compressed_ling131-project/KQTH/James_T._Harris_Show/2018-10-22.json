I just want to point out that the news media is saying that President Trump invented this this taunted this mockery of a\nOf a Senator Warren with her phony Indian thing and that's not true this has been going on for a long time this mockery of of her of her ridiculous claim\nSenator Warren blister ancestry report and it said that\nThe great majority of Warren's identifiable ancestry is European however the report adds the analysis also identified five genetic segments as Native American in origin at high confidence and this is what Elizabeth Warren put out now this is a a joke of course\nHowever yesterday afternoon Cherokee Nation released a statement saying\nIn part that DNA tests are useless in determining tribal citizenship and people are using DNA to connect themselves to Cherokee Nation is inappropriate\nAnd ah that was a a gentle right on what they said because they were a little more direct the statement itself says from the Cherokee Nation\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish\nListen to this whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and wild DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nI senator or you're going to you racists you began are you going to stop offending Native Americans now it makes a mockery out of DNA tests\nAnd it's a legitimate uses while also this honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage that is from the

citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best can give you some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have Lyndon north and South America maybe in a native\nPeoples of those continents um\nIt's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native Americans in this country\nIt is irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American so this whole thing was just want want want it's Emily would tell law it's never mind my DNA test doesn't say anything in fact if it indicates anything it indicates that I Am less Native American than the average Whitey\nOn the moon okay [laughter]\nI got to get to Whitey on the moon a little later on why is Whitey on the moon in the show today well you might be surprised but it's another reason I'll get to it in a little bit on the other reason they're crazy people now let's go to Elizabeth Warren she's out there saying that the president or a million dollars let's go to number four\nBecause this is what President Trump actually said when he made this or the news media and and and Elizabeth Warren not smart people not the really you can't take them seriously\n... saying no President Trump or a million dollars because she fulfilled all of the requirements that President Trump laid out if she gets a DNA test\nAnd it proves that she is in fact part Paul Paul than President Trump owes her a million dollars this is the phony arguing that they just lie about everything they live right by Brett Kavanaugh there a lot about Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton lies about everybody they lie about everything\nAnd a President Trump actually said these words in July about the DNA tests\nYou know those little kids they saw on television for two dollars\nAnd first of all the little kids and in\n[noise] which he claims that she's of Indian\nBecause her mother said she has hiking thoughts that's\nThat her mother such yet I think about when he was\nVery gently take that can I say\nMillion dollars\nIf you take a test that it shows you're in\n\n[noise]\nNow the test does not show she's an Indian be a debate has not happened she is not the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United states has not given her the uh the uh DNA tests on a stage during the presidential debate a and a and and I didn't\nHear him call her mother a liar which is another late and that what she said that she keeps calling my mother a liar President Trump keeps going my mother a liar that he didn't call a Elizabeth Warren's mother mall pall a liar didn't call anybody a liar\nBecome my mom a liar\nHe didn't do that so she just lied there in calling uh\nLiar he didn't want to call my mom a liar\nYeah he didn't do that and he's so she just lied there in calling a\nSaying that President Trump was lying about her mother being a liar there's a lot of lying going on here it's a circle festive lives a tangled train wreck ... stupidity\nBut there it is um he didn't say that your mother's alarm or he did say that you have to become the nominee be on a debate stage she gives you the DNA kid you don't get to pick your own DNA person who is a you know a corrupt to Democrats fellow travelers from a college campus\nBut it did when a CNN listen to that or watch that video this morning Alison Schmidt Allison ... who used to be a reporter listened to it

be present for at least a couple of the executions so they filmed the executions for them so that he could see them later at least a couple where they hand or a Hitler's enemies with piano wire\nAnd Hitler wanted to watch the films of this so is print saw him on the the uh the culprit here behind the curtain\nQuite possibly and perhaps quite probably that said\nThere's a lot of palace intrigue around there these days you know he turned the Ritz hotel in Riyadh into a prison and through a bunch of his cousins in to a luxury sweets but they were not allowed to leave they could get room

eight nine four one packs and an eight nine to one Seventy two four seven whatever you long for the ride ...\nI I'm just wondering is was that proof positive yesterday that in fact the NFL players do not want to solve the problem whatever the problem is that they proceed with the ...\nDo they not know why they're kneeling that could be another thing so you had Amy Schumer and funny Amy Schumer complain there's not enough white players were kneeling\nFeeling that could be another thing so you had Amy Schumer and funny Amy Schumer complain that not enough white players were kneeling and then a couple of players will happen to be black and I'll think race as an issue here or you should be anyway I'm going at each other because one's allegedly a sellout because the NFL set a hundred million dollars do you\nUm to help solve whatever this problem is that you say there is is there really no solution and the NFL players will keep on doing this the NFL will keep losing viewers and fans the NFL will keep losing money and um well money that they're still making money but losing money as as compared to what they could be making\nIs is that league just done because I Can't imagine that this is\nGoing to last much longer where you live there are people teetering I'm like I Love the NFL I'm gonna watch any way on a grab a snack while they're kneeling during the anthem gonna pretend it's not happening eventually people will crack look you're not going to find a bigger Miami Dolphins fan than I Am\nDon't even know who the starting quarterback is now I guess it's still what's his face Ryan what's his nose I'd do with the tannahill I don't know I guess\nI ... and people try to tell me if they're doing very well to see them do I deal with the record is don't care I don't know who they're starting running back is don't care to know who they're big wide receiver as the guy who has the most sects have no clue don't care haven't watched the second to the NFL this season not even a highlight\nWhen it comes to my local news I shut it off\nThat's where I Am now I'm not unique when it comes to that there were a lot of people who have reclaimed their Sunday and Monday and Thursdays they have and it might not ever go back\nBut when you get right down to brass tacks and you say you're kneeling for a cause and you say okay we've actually taken action on the cause for what you say you're kneeling\nNow let's get back to playing football start standing up and then you call somebody else a sellout for accepting that somebody that the league actually said we're listening to you are we doing something about it\nThere's something wrong with you Ben at that point there's something wrong with you it's a eight eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com let me go to the phone lines and say hello to Zack who's in Alabama Zach what's going on high\nHey so I just want to say you know first off or only bringing up one player in all the NFL right now right know ... ... so you have a problem with right now or no no no no no I have\nA problem with anybody who's kneeling Aaron Reid's just dumb enough to go after somebody who actually set a hundred million dollars is good Eric read is the guy of the day because he attacked somebody who stopped kneeling 'cause the guy who started feeling said a hundred million dollar investment into what our problem is is a good thing so go ahead I'm listening\nBut what did a hundred million dollars to do what can they do a lot right right and it's no good I don't really is no good but knocking Jenkins wasn't protesting the NFL or you\nKnow he was protesting well\nAgain you have to go back to a Catholic said originally captured even even nobody was protesting it was making that up because he was benched and then a bunch of other people jumped on board for whatever reason they were protesting the alleged depression there is no oppression in this country that's alive go to a country where there is operation of an old no there is no oppression here you know why we have laws that actually say\nUnder law must offer equal opportunity to everybody in this country so you think there was a pressure and maybe you should go to China or Venezuela and find out about oppression go ahead what else\nOkay just you know just because you know there is no there is there's more or less they're legally they're legally isn't legally there is in our laws actually for bitter Russian and anybody but there is no murders in America\nOh no no nobody said that but by law if you're being oppressed and you bring it highlighted ...\nMurder anybody are are you smoking crack happen people commit crimes\nLaw if you are being oppressed and you bring it highlighted and\nMurder anybody are\nAre you smoking crack happen people commit crimes\nThat doesn't mean that that crime is legal I'm telling you that our laws\nActually say you can't oppressed people I mean we have it in our our actual constitution when slavery ended we got the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four there are actual laws in place that say oppression is illegal so if it does happen\nBring it to light guys like me and I'm guessing guys like you will say hey something illegal is happening here let's stop it so you're comparing that to murder is actually kinda dumb but again the NFL is throwing a hundred million dollars at whatever this causes\nAnd Malcolm Jenkins says hey I
