lot of people saw on the phone line from last\nHour and if you're just joining us this hour we appreciate you are welcome aboard we are of course talking about what do we do now\nBecause at some point we used to have to come up with a solution and stop listening to the idiots on Twitter or the idiots on the news media the fake news media um we also have to stop pretending originally delineation between news media and fake news media there is even some conservatives have fallen for it\nThe president should stop attacking the media you know the media is not the enemy of the other people know the media is not the fake news media is the fake news media is the enemy because it's delivering fake news\nIncorrect stories inaccurate on purpose to sway opinion or to change people's minds that's a problem that's a real problem he's not saying the news media is the enemy of the leasing the fake news media is and guess what he's allowed he's got a First Amendment to\nHe's allowed to say that\nBut more important than that then the attacks and the president for saying what he's been saying for a while more important is how do we solve the problem of of shootings that soft targets\nWas it Fifteen people in Las Vegas at a concert\nYou've got no eleven people at a synagogue Seventeen at the high school in Parkland, Florida thirty two at Virginia Tech Thirteen Columbine twelve of the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado mean enough is enough now I mean\nPeople these bad guys are choosing\nSoft targets and you know it's a soft target versus a hard target you know we use these terms as if we're you know\nLike the news media will say that he fled on foot now we ran away or let's let's just put it was played speak plain speak is\nThe bad guys are targeting places they know they will get no resistance\nThey're targeting places it misses a wealth told story at of Aurora, Colorado that bad guy had an option of six different movie theaters he chose the one they didn't allow concealed carry let that sink in now why would have done that it's actually pretty simple he did that because he knew nobody will be shooting back\nAnd it costs less\nMental flow goal new Tucson dot com boom won three nine seven four or five\nAnd talk to the caller for right now the ... one one for one two and a four pack of U. of M. football scholarships for seven five one one for one that's seven five one one oh four one lacks\nAre just too much of a joke\nHave you here in Haiti nine four one has any day\nNine four one Seventy two four seven ... home for the ride thanks a lot for stopping by a there was a lot going on a lot of people on the phone lines that are going to be a grant stitch field at the bottom of the hour and a TV and make sure that you stick around for that we got\nThis story though from I'm from Pittsburgh v the liberal mayor there um has some ... some people say this sort of is a microcosm of what I've been saying which is the left really does believe that more laws that these are helped me out here\nThe blaze Pittsburgh the Democratic Mayor Bill to do do sit on the meet the press Sunday that he doesn't believe that more armed guard that places of worship are the answer and at the appropriate response to Saturday's mass murder the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh is more gun control\nAppearing on NBC's flagship Sunday news program produce that I Belong to an organization a bipartisan organization called the Mayors Against illegal guns I don't think the answer to this problem solved by having her synagogues mosques in church is\nFilled with armed guards or a school filled with armed guards Mayors Against illegal guns as an anti gun group formed by former New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg but it will continue to we should try to stop a rational behavior from happening at the forefront and not trying to create laws around irrational behavior to continue\nAnd but Duda was responding to comments made by president Donald Trump for a campaign rally on Saturday or friday the tragedy President Trump said this is a case where if they had an armed guard inside they might have been able to stop and immediately isn't it a shame that way\nI said this is a case where if they had had an armed guard and side they might have been able to stop and immediately edited a shame that we even have to think of that inside of the temple or inside of a church but certainly the result might have been far better\nThan expected Saturday's mass murder has been charged with dozens of federal crime so far including murder and hate crimes he additionally faces numerous possible prosecutions are violations of Pennsylvania law and the killer social media profiles are rife with anti Semitic comments including comments that marriage President Trump for having too many Jews and his administration\nAnd put it all has a lengthy history and that hearing to liberal causes in opposition to President Trump including a promise that the city of Pittsburgh would continue to follow the Paris climate agreement under President Trump announced the country's withdraw from the protocol\nSuggest so so people understand this exactly makes my point\nThis guy Pluto was surrounded by good guys with guns\nHe was protected under the police she was probably nearby you probably had several other either a uniformed or or plainclothes officers nearby I'm willing to take somebody down had they threatened his life I'm not here to say it shouldn't be that way you know the mayor should be protected\nSo why would he as he is being protected as Cuomo does every time he speaks in New York uh Bloomberg does every time he speaks they're all surrounded by good guys with guns to protect them as they say that's not what's going to fix it\nIf they believed that they wouldn't have anybody with a gun anywhere near them but they wouldn't take that chance and I don't blame them because they'd be in harm's way\nSo stop it because they're basically saying let them eat cake they're basically saying we have plenty of food there are other people who need some food screw them let them eat cake\nWell we enjoy you know the pot roast ... the steak and lobster it really is the same thing\nBecause if you walk out and say nobody should have guns and guns are bad and the new legislation you shouldn't be surrounded by people with guns you\nShould allow them the people that you're speaking to to enjoy the same safety you do\nYou're basically like the let them eat cake example putting himself on the pedestal I'm more important than you are I should make sure that I Am protected and if you're not protected all complain about bad laws are not enough laws it's very strange yet that's the way that we see it or they see it\nSo I've asked for somebody who's on the left to call in and give me an example of what a piece of legislation looks like or what a solution looks like from your perspective I'm told Aaron is on the left Arun welcome to the program what's going on\nYou know hey I'm\nSo um I my question is a\nVery like ... ... is there an example anywhere in a foreigner or a domestic example of the day or a government\nThat has increased gun population increase and armed its citizens and at the same time has decreased the amount of gun violence and got an accident\nOr ... yes absolutely I mean just look up a book by John lot that's L. O. T. T. read up for yourself not really sure why you called and asked me a question but the government doesn't arm anybody\n'cause you just said the whole premise of your of your question was can you give me a place for domestic where the government has armed with the people\nDo you just said the whole premise of your of your question was can you give me a place for domestic where the government has armed as of people and the the crime rate or the gun rate of the murder rate has gone down yes it happens all the time when good guys are armed than\nBad guys avoid them\nThat's the way it works I'll give you an adverse example that actually makes my point\nAnd maybe 'cause you sound like a smart guy maybe you'll understand it better when you've got laws like in Washington D. C. where nobody can own a gun you've got an out of control gun murder rate when you've got a place like Chicago where nobody's allowed to own a gun legally you've got an out of control murder rate why Iran do you think that's happening\nYou know\nI think he's still there Cary air it was my major head hurt [laughter] come on and is editor and my question was so ... so in other words now look I did not hang up on there and they didn't even put on hold\nHe asked me a question which wasn't the whole idea of the idea was if you're on the left or if you're a Democrat tell me what you would do instead he thought he would ask me a question that I guess would corner me or something\nAnd maybe my answer I got to tell you my answer proud and I agree with you carry my answer was so good on that and you get them off the foreigners fan that actually pretty short now pretty sure you were thinking you know I mean that is free imagine where insurance O'Hare and yet ... dumb question specious question do me a favor and go and get John lots book\nA I've never had a lot I was going to one point but he'll get along very well but having said that he is the forty on this go and get his book\nAnd they're a statistic after statistic after statistic that shows that where you've got a heavily armed illegally heavily armed community you go lower gun violence rates because the bad guys are not willing to take the chance it's the same deterrent you know I talk about this all the tell him say it again I think it's a good example\nCarrying I both have the same car instead of her car's a flashing red light noting there's an alarm inside my car there is not a flashing red light the car thieves gonna steal one of them the car he is going to steal or she's going to steal is going to be the one that will offer the path of least resistance\nIf he or she opens the car door for Kerry's car an alarm will go off opens my car door one won't go off it's very simple I'm not going to go in\nTo a convenience store that has a sign out front that says we are foreign employees all of whom are carrying guns\nI'm going to go into the one that says no guns allowed here\nThat if I'm a bad guy that wants to Rob the joint that's what I'm Talking about so so Aaron I hear ya\n... and I wish you the very best but your question didn't make any sense because she didn't even do any a little bit of research on it to find out you know the answer was before you pose that I think you thought you do what the answer was but you weren't\nSo I've got a bunch of other people on the line here Carrie but I've got a guy named Franklin who just called in so have you been holding you got to be patient with me Franklin claims that he's a Democrat he wants to argue or I or go frankly what are you got for me\nIt's a hey fending\nFor I guess if there\nIs a little bit of delay nor the egg nor the television what's on your mind\nDo what'd you say in the sense that given analogy that because I don't have gotten in my house someone who's not going to ...\nI I don't know what you do this and I was I mean you just said well you just said is not something that I said what what what specifically do that makes sense\nYou said that you just said well maybe they like that you weren't going to taste because they said guns are not allowed here\nI didn't have the ... and a guy never I never said which is that\nI said was if I'm a bad guy and I want to go I Want to go Rob a convenience store\nNever I never said or did you say\nWhat what I said was if I'm a bad guy and I want to go I Want to go Rob a convenience store one convenience store has a sign that says we are for employees here that I'll have guns\nAnd the other can be your store says no guns allowed ... now you got to go to dump 'em polo and on television or you can read that in time or not but you know you knew that Franklin was going to go there\nYou know that he was going to go there and actually tried to recall but it was an up and\nRunning\n... [noise]\n[noise] oh I Want\nPeople who are listening in watching the understand right now in ... by the way you're listening on on our heart the big we don't editor my heart goes out on the Internet but on television radio we had a dump somebody really should\nI'm\nI'm it's insane to me you know we have a right to protect ourselves the law abiding is not the problem that's for sure\nI've often thought to myself if you're going to have a sign up and in Texas it's\nWe have a right to protect ourselves the\nLaw abiding is not the problem that's for sure\nYeah I've often thought to myself if you're going to have a sign up and in Texas it's a thirty six on earth are real one side if you're gonna have a sign ups and go I Can't carry can protect my family my stuff my my person then you should protect me\nIf you're if you're going to have an open a combination please come in here or don't worry don't bring your gun it'll be better off if you didn't shouldn't ... then that business that outlet that whatever it happens to be offered me the safety that I would've offer myself otherwise\nWell you would hope that they would but often times what I say is ignorance from lack of knowledge\nThey're not thinking they're living in the fairy tale world that they put a sign in the window that somehow the criminals going to say oh there's a sign in the window I'm gonna leave my gun in the car you know if it's not happening I find that when I go to a restaurant and I see that's done and I ended up leaving my my firearm in the trunk of my vehicle I go in and I talked I get one chance I talked to him\nHere's why you're safer look we just had a McDonald's in Alabama yesterday I saw this\n... father who's a concealed handgun license holders stops and armed intruder and there's McDonalds inspiring shots\nGunfire and says he shoots and it kills the guy coming in to do who knows what it could have been a mass shooting this McDonald's with customers in there and what would it we've been seeing today we would've had lived trucks for every TV station across the country in the parking lot of that McDonalds instead\nThere's nothing on the national media about this this was a story where a guy save lives didn't take them but that's not the story they want\nA guy walked into McDonalds started shooting and and as you say the big guy took out his gun and he was there with his sons he got his gun filled the guy he was injured himself he's gonna be okay but you're right there will be no light shed on this because that\nIn fact would make our point of that thirty two don't die at Virginia Tech if if a teacher and professor could have had a gun that people might not have died in Sandy Hook if a teacher and a administrator or some sort of a Marshall and the school had a gun on that's really the bottom line but you're you're hearing it already we need\nCommonsense gun legislation there was a mass shooting at at a synagogue there was a shooting this morning I guess at a school somewhere um we this is not to sit and we need\nDo you have any idea what exactly the laws are other than getting rid of the second amendment that ... that they say will help because I have not heard one suggestion from one of these left these that says if you do this this would have prevented that\nWell you you ingest now and so I use to save for a long time last year and and long before that\nThat they're coming for the second amendment the way they get there is straight through the n._r._a. they know that that is the biggest offender or the second amendment once they do away with the second amendment it's going to be a free for all for the constitution\nI used to be called a crazy man for making that prediction down but then what have we seen we see a former Supreme Court justice and says that the second amendment needs to be overturned you've got left wing politicians just about every one you can think of er name has made a public statement that says the second amendment should be repealed or done away with and\nI'm not crazy anymore for saying that they are now openly admitting that that is what they want\nBut we know Joe that's not going to work they're not going to get there I don't think the American people want it overwhelmingly the majority of Americans do not side with this idea of gun control they blame Congress we're not getting done a Congress has just been listening to the people the people don't want it\nYeah well they they don't want to because of that right and and I I saw a video that you did earlier um ... he's a great host of ordinary TV I make sure you go and check them out great stuff on YouTube is well\nI saw some video where you were talking about those ... and and the bottom line was for some reason the left gives all sorts of credence to a bunch of other amendments but the second amendment is not looked at as a write it's they don't get some you know an added later saying that that really we should do away with not because most gets um\nAmendment is not looked at as a write it's maybe get some you know an added later saying that that really we should do away with not because most gets um you're writing your assessment that the second amendment is as important if not more important than the others because it's actually in place I Believe to protect the rest of them\nIt is the second amendment wasn't really about\nThey landed on hunting practiced it's not\nIt's not and it was about think about our founding fathers and what they had just gone through right think about what early America was like when you are at war with England or ... ruler\nThe second amendment they wrote it because they didn't want to be ruled like tyranny and they knew that if they had done that was protection and what is the first nation do that's going to go down the path of charity or dictatorship or socialism or whatever you want to call it\nThey disarm the people and so I Do believe there are forces at play in America that want the people disarm and it's a power play it has nothing to do with safety\nThen there's the other set of people that are blind shape and they just follow their leaders who want the power and it feels good for them and it's emotional for them to say let's just not have any guns anywhere but those people are not thinking they've been duped\nI warn you not to have a conversation with him because it would make your head hurt they don't know anything about firearms they don't know anything about the second amendment a short reading of the federalist papers or the actual constitution itself ... will make it very clear to you the second amendment and all the amendments really are there ... there in ... writes granted by the creator\nProtected by this document this document tells going to what he can't do\nAnd the second amendment clearly was put in there\nAs basically the founding fathers saying never again and say that he wasn't go should the deer wasn't go get some food for dinner although that's nice there wasn't go uh go down to compete in a target to shoot it was never again will this happen or it it's great to go ahead\nWell I was just going to say Joe you know under the never again model right President Trump came out yesterday and said there was no armed security inside the synagogue and he was vilified for saying that\nThese two brand police officers were injured that went in and stop the shooter interrupted the shooting spree got the shooter to to retreat saved who knows how many lives Jill\nThey were there in one minute Joe can you imagine if a concealed handgun license holder an armed security guard was in there and engaged him within five seconds or ten seconds how many lives would have been said and yet the president's vilified for common sense don't add gun control in the end of that common sense you know that that that's all we\nKnow the Saturday's shooting ended because good guy showed up with guns and took the guy at a ... of course the great host or to enter a TV uh people are dying to know the ... and I don't mean to to say ... but people really really want to notice um\nWhat do they do we go to church we go to synagogue we go to school we go to or a grocery store we go to the mall we go to theaters what do we do because it is it any more that fantasy open society where you're pretty much gonna be okay don't worry about it at any time a bad guy is going to try to take advantage of a so called soft target\nThe carrying anyway even if they don't go don't go to places that don't offer protection don't go to places that don't let us carry what do you do\nUh well first and foremost you abide by the laws that if there's a sign in the window says you're not allowed to carry in there and you obviously you leave your fire or at home but I wouldn't tell people\nTo talk to the to the folks in their community whether it's your church whether it's people at your school and taught to them and figure out as a group what you'd think it is is right for that organization that wants to protect itself now as an individual\nIf you feel comfortable or you or want to inquire about about a carrying a firearm will I Will get in touch with your local NRA instructor there's tons of them and start digging\nWant to inquire about about a carrying a firearm will I Will get in touch with your local NRA instructor there's tons of them and start to get familiar with firearms go through some training the interests of carry guard program which is absolutely phenomenal I'm On a course that I went through and she she all about personal protection\nI tried to train as much as I possibly can I like going to the range because I enjoy it but I also do it because it's my responsibility do mostly Joe holders like this they train\nGet the training to the point where you feel comfortable Joe I get the firearms are not right for everybody my goal is to make sure that everyone in America was legally allowed to do so has the right if they want to carry I don't want to make everybody carry I just want you to exercise your right if you want to\nBut let me finish ... field ... you're on the Internet you're running or a TV I'm the first thing out of the left is always the n._r._a. is just trying to show more guns great have you ever had anybody for the return to tell you let's let's do some more guns\nYou know

to see a civil war right here mess in the United states\nWell I Would never be successful to take it away and it was there it sounds like there's a big push to do it but it's a it's a very small minority of people I was just going anywhere man\nOr you know a while back somebody I think it was all nasty uh it'll rain was instigate Dale where there's a clause in a second man and she was ...

we need to rise above that and say look at how great he is doing look at how what are standing is in the world look with our economy is doing I think that's the smart play here it's like when people used to call in because they wanted to give me the reasons why they believed that rock Obama was born in Kenya\nAnd I'd stop them and I'd say stop it\nI don't know where he was born you know where he was born ... says Hawaii then I got another ... says Hawaii that people who say they were witnesses of it and and he is the president so let's not hang our hat on that let's focus on what he's doing in the job and his job performance was so bad\nThat it was easy to talk about what it was he wasn't doing for this country\nYou would get you could focus on this fantasy about him not being born here or or\n... ... was forging numbers did we did the other thing and all that other crap or you can charities in the job it's now our job to make sure people understand how bad he is at this\nAnd that's what I was employing people to do so I'm not here to say get away with uranium one I'm not here to say get away with wrongdoing and in horrible things what I'm saying is you want to do that in the

the whole\nFrom a issue with the immigration and all end up a whole bunch of people coming through the border\nUh which is acts like a a ever write to your house and thinking about and they have a right to be here no ma'am they don't know how they act like it I'm\nNo they don't I'm Sorry to say I am a Latin myself\nAnd um there's a right way to do do things and there was a wrong way to do

kind of massive amount of\nPeople through any territory and it's dangerous they're going to take over the jobs that are going to take over it's dangerous thing everything's going to change mhm\nAll

people a and different traditions and there's a lot of resentment being built up in Columbia friends of mine there as a teaching profession everything construction same kind of problems stay there\n\nYou guys heard me talk about a product for months that has changed my sleeping habits for ever it's called my pillow\nOpen loopholes in our immigration law and these aliens are well\nHomicide and or violence in Central America but what is out is that there are serious wide open loopholes in our immigration law and these aliens are well coached and they know that if you say the magic words you're given a ticket in\nWell the fact of the matter is uh Mexico has confirmed Mexican official speaking to me last week confirmed that\nThere were a Honduran left wing politicians one of them was removed from the caravan along with a couple of other associates or who is an opposition leader was actually working in concert with Venezuelan\nA bullet politicians and getting help and comfort from groups within the United states who also have been aiding uh these masses of people as well so there's a\nComplicated Web of facilitators behind the scenes a who's who put the word out that is as long as you get into this group Katie you'll be protected because there's strength and numbers\nBeing a part of a caravan does not give these special rights\nI'm but our message is simple and our message is clear we will not allow a large group an authorized migrants to enter the U.S and unsafe or unlawful manner we've already seen these groups for say break immigration laws in Mexico and Guatemala they've employed violent and dangerous tactics have you mentioned\nAgainst both Mexican and Guatemala and immigration security teams the secretary made clear last week that we will ensure that our men and women on the front lines or protect and defend it and the president has done so in calling up\nThe military and ensuring that we have the resources we need to not only secure the border but defend our men and women on the front lines\nHave you I'm prepared already a and homeland security with the chance that the president was referencing yesterday that there you're going to now started housing people intense so they will not be released into society at large does\nAs they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravan size we're seeing every single day on the border we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal aliens throughout the tendency of their immigration hearing right now we're forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit the words out Laura\nI mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase in family unit apprehensions and the last five years\nWhere I record number of family that apprehensions this year alone what that says if you have a child with you we have to release you into the interior there's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years of male adults coming with children than ever before\nWe're not able to detain them and immediately return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there's not much we can do and the way of deterrence to immediately apprehend and repatriate which which is border security\nWhere if there were children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct\nCorrect and we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a it's a pretty decent percentage well record\nLow a male um of adult apprehensions this year I think it's like a Nineteen Seventy one is the last time we were this low in terms of adult apprehension you know so that's you know and you're able to deliver a consequence know migration pattern change when we're able to say that we're going to\nIt's a ... you know so that's the only and you're able to deliver a consequence know migration pattern change when we're able to say that we're going to refer you for prosecution you broke US law we're going to send you to a judge and have a penalty\nYou know illegal aliens they they know they know are you a lot better than members of Congress to\nAh this was Terry McAuliffe course a good friend of the Clintons former governor of Virginia speaking about the uh the use I mean current governor of Virginia speaking about the use of the military let's listen\nTo a thousand miles away their goal and three miles an hour it's several weeks and by the time they get her and here's the point\nHe did as the show today to deploy the army donor what a disgrace this man has no politicized the military and his use or military for political purposes it's wall I was in the Marines today I can tell you as parents of children who are wearing the cost of our country to protect our country\nPresident should not politicize\nA former governor of Virginia obviously this is called sleeping for three hours and I get Katie uh you you heard what he said the president by referencing the military as he has been doing sending them to the border that that is politicizing the military\n[noise] you know all I can say is this president didn't create this caravan this caravan you know took off with no control over who started it and when you know in Central America but I Will tell you that there is no way in which a large group of migrants should be able to come into our United States\nAs a large group just because you were in that group is president has every right to ensure that our borders are secure and defended\nAnd that's what he's done\nIn the homeland security department people you know think about in a border control and immigration and Customs Enforcement ice is part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of homeland security correct\nAbsolutely out so we got the left wants to abolish ice on despite all the great work I does with human trafficking drug interdiction uh and obviously important work and deporting a dangerous people from the United states\nUm but I think people don't really quite comprehend that this is not a victimless crime illegal immigration ... their victims or economic victims there the effect\nOn public schools effect on our healthcare system how closely is homeland security working with other agencies on the effects on American society of math illegal immigration\nThe secretaries just in Yuma, Arizona last week with both Ron fatality acting ice director and Kevin Michaeline into had US Customs and border protection to meet with local sheriffs local officials to ensure that they have the resources they need to handle the influx of family units\nThat they see at the border you know we're meeting with these NGOs and these communities to ensure that we aren't just releasing into communities because of the sheer number we're seeing every day at the border I mean but someone has to pick up the tab when we transfer aliens to hospitals\nAnd that is the American taxpayer\nAnd I think people forget that every time you see the illegal immigrants dropped off at bus depots or even flown around you know the the when the kids are kids are coming unaccompanied they're placed with a quote sponsor sponsors sometimes themselves are illegal immigrants that costs money\nIt doesn't come out of thin air as my mother used to say someone has to pay the tab\nNow we have Thirteen thousand children unaccompanied alien children in a church has custody right now they cost us taxpayers thirty three thousand dollars each annually\nJust that just people have to chew over there\nTaxpayers thirty three thousand dollars each annually wow\nJust that just people have to chew over that figure thirty three thousand dollars each illegal immigrant in the United states annually to the American taxpayer\nThat's more than it cost for me to go to college\nOh my gosh this is Rocco bomb I just a few days ago on the uh mid term trail referencing this issue of the caravan and the president's concern about it once was some\nAre trying to convince everybody to be afraid of a bunch of\nRefugees thousand\nAble to retire suddenly\n\nThere for that kind of\nFear mongering Katie\nLast year we apprehended Seventeen thousand criminal aliens at the border three thousand special interest aliens we know that there are criminals and the flow and the care of and that it had ignoring border security and clean the ability to move as we apprehend and get us the right to defend our borders it's that simple\nKatie Waldman spokesperson for U.S Department of homeland security Katie thanks so much we'll check back

I'm a citizen I think that's how we're going yeah sure what it is like on a diet but uh but there's confusion here this jurisdiction Arab doesn't apply to the parents that applies to the baby all persons born\nOr naturalized in the United states are subject and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIf the person is born that person is then subject to the jurisdiction thereof why wouldn't the person be you are subject to the laws and regulations and rules and and and so on where you're born\nSo the argument that well the parents aren't subject to the jurisdiction thereof therefore the kid is in in what world I don't know where you guys got that now I Am I Am for changing the fourteenth amendment\nTo say somebody coming across the border illegally for the sole purpose of having a child to make the child a citizen or somebody be across the border illegally immigrate how long have you been here they have a child the child is not a citizen I'm okay with all that but you have to\nA citizen or somebody would cross the border illegally under how long have you been here if they have a child the child is not a citizen I'm okay with all that\nBut you have to make a legal change to the constitution you don't just say it because you feel like it and that is that it has to actually be changed in ratified by the states that's the right way to do it that's what the founding fathers put it this way\nWell hell yeah you could change or laws hell yes you can change the laws you could change\nThe constitution you're going to mend it there's an amendment process you can't just snap your fingers and make it happen no and yes I've got people sending me emails no the federalist papers say listen to me\nI understand the federalist papers give context to the intent I understand that\nLet me be as clear as I can the fourteenth amendment is written in English I read English I read it very well understand it I comprehend\nAs I read that it doesn't say anything about the parents have to be you know I'm subject to the jurisdiction there are eight says all persons born the person who's being born is the child so yes change it\nThe Thirteen fourteen fifty men which were about slavery in abolishing it and getting rid of it it was to make sure this amendment ended up itself was to make sure that former slaves were not treated like\nLike less than citizens by the Democrats they try to do that the Democrats tried to make sure slaves would never have the rights of citizens and the writers citizenship they tried to grandfather them out of them are voting\n\nAnd the good guys the Republicans said screw you were going to update this constitution and make sure that those people who were born here\nOf slavery now have citizenship should should the people who amending the constitution and the Eighteen sixties should they have made sure they wrote in there the U.S former slaves would be citizens or our citizens yes they probably should have because this was this was way too much up for grabs\nSo yeah I think it should be amended or that you should be changed I don't think the president can do it none of his own let me grab a quick phone call before we do the interview with the bottom of the hour it's gonna be Lisa in Houston least about a minute go ahead\nHi I say I agree with the private down that I realized that um the wait at the moment but I think our generosity is only like Atlanta and here we're not the world that we cannot\nTake care of everybody we just can't do it all I think we've said right now 'cause I'm going to the court and the people that were standing at all that and he's a clarinet or I think we're starting to al ...\nOr ... you and I agree but but I disagree that the president can do is be some sort of executive see that's what we complained about what bronco balmy he kept on going around Congress should be done the right way I think that the fourteenth amendment it sounds like you agree should be changed but I don't think any president can just with a swipe of a pen make that happen\nAnd get a better life and and and I believe Mexico so we'll give you some money would give me some food we've got jobs available but it's really not about that ... what do you think it's about\nYou know the number one and number two reason you know these migrants at an incredibly dangerous journey north is one for family reunification for illegal aliens are you living in the United states and the second is for economic opportunity\nAgain that's not a silent you know I mentioned that dangerous journey thirty one percent of women are assaulted during the journey and Seventeen percent of men\nDiscuss you know I don't know what does that stop in Mexico you have made it to a safe place claim asylum there\n... it's interesting it's getting wild and homeland security spokesperson on this caravan and so much more uh you're absolutely right I'm fifty two growing up in South Florida I saw refugees who really do need asylum they needed to get away from Castro they're going to kill him\nI'm it'd be dared say I don't like the like the government or people coming from the Soviet Union we have to get away from your they will kill us put us in the Google in the gulag if we don't agree with everything they say that's true political asylum where you're going to die if you dare say I want freedom and liberty people coming from China\nAt the time of the Ottoman square when a tank would run you over if you dared say I want freedom\nThese people aren't running from from political or religious persecution or prosecution or are they I mean I I haven't seen one interview with one one of these refugees are these ... members who was said anything other than we just want a better life where we just want to know more money we just want a better job\nYou know a few things on that is before twenty Thirteen one out of every one hundred arriving airlines claimed credible fear today it's one out of every ten you\nKnow to Central America isn't ten times more dangerous right but our immigration laws have become much more well known and they're on this journey and they know that if you say those magic words we pretty much not only let you into the country but then give you a work permit while you're here eighty\nPercent of people claiming credible fear the basis for asylum pass initial\nStraight but then give you a work permit while you're here eighty percent of people claiming credible fear the basis for asylum pass initial credible fear interview but\nOnly twenty percent are granted asylum by an immigration judge and that's years down the line so at that thing is most people\nDo not have a real legitimate credible fear asylum claim but what that does do is that puts the true asylum seekers the true people who really do need this at the back of the line and let them weight which has come and clearly unfair just to gain entry into the United states\nBut it's absolutely true and I'm also hearing and told me this is true or not I'm also hearing that a lot of these these refugees are ... members or the turban people whenever we're calling them to\nHave in their pockets scripts this is what you say to somebody on the United states side to to be one of those ... percent who get passed on to the next level or you want him to be true\nI mean absolutely you hear from our border patrol agents that are ice officers whether that be an ice attention or whether that be when they're first apprehended that these aliens are extremely well coached you know what to say and that's born out in the numbers you know I was just looking at the most recent data that eighty percent of the northern triangle country has Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras eighty percent last year\nPassing national credible fear interview but only twenty percent of granted us out and buy an immigration judge that means eighty percent of people who claim asylum\nAren't actually asylum seekers that is shocking\nTo me than it is a shocking numbers are pretty sure you bringing it it's pretty wild and homeland security spokesperson Leah see those people watching and listening right now want to know what's happening\nBoots on the ground we're hearing about the national guard don't hear about military troops going or we're also hearing that they might not be armed with in my view on but but only in self defense that can really take action what is happening on the border right now that have got to make us rest assured that fourteen thousand or three ... and her six thousand cube breakthrough anytime they want\nTo reach us in coordination with the department of defense is launching a multi phase response to you know whether these migrants arrive at the ... the Caribbean arrives at the border at a port of entry or in between the ports of entry north ... is the operational command providing assistance\nUm some of what what they're going to do is planning assistance engineering support temporary barriers barricades and things fixed and writer wing aviation medical teams military police essentially what they're doing is\nUs the capability to be where we need to be and when we need to be there and preparation of this caravan we have eight hundred soldiers on their way to Texas from Fort Campbell in Fort Knox and by the end of this week there'll be over fifty two hundred troops deployed to the southwest border that's in addition to the two thousand soldiers already deployed\nFrom the national guard as part of operation guardian support these troops will initially be in South Texas than Arizona and then California right\nIt's a city will kill you wonder you you you guys are good people but but you're also part of a a a a department that shouldn't pay attention to politics\nIs there anything that goes on with you and your co workers and even the director when you hear things like these these people on the left running for elections abolish ice\nThere would have ... we have to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement stops him Mr teams that stuff's all the drugs in the sex trafficking people actually think they want their like that will make things better do you have to purposely ignore that professionally but then when you when you're on the way home thank you so what's going on why would they say that\nNo and in fact I'm proud to stand up for the men and women of ice every single day of they do incredible work you know from cybercrime sex trafficking human trafficking you know these the men and women I Want to finding my communities and ensuring that I have a safe needed eleven\nUm and I think anyone who says differently as completely completely misguided and uninformed\nWell they should educate themselves because there isn't a week goes by it just I follow us on Twitter ... every single weeds have does some humongous drug busts\nWell they should educate themselves because there isn't a week goes by I guess I follow ice on Twitter ... every single week they've got some humongous drug busts or some big busted him is Thirteen and it was Thirteen who by the way would have no problem chilling and getting all of us Soviet ... these are good people doing good work do you ever talked to the frontline ice people the the members of ice\nAnd and you know are they are they still you know from where the getting demoralized by this stuff I mean where are they on this\nNow they're fighting the good fight and they have a lot of support from their partners and play a whether that be local police you know\nYou

Central America other than those from Mexico we've heard people from Bangladesh we've heard people from other parts of the middle east do we know who's in this caravan and and who's been infiltrating at\nThe age as as closely monitoring the caravan and I will say just based off the criminal any numbers that provided to earlier that Seventeen thousand or arrested last year at the southern border and three thousand ... special interest aliens\nOr is it the last year pretty much guarantee you the type a population we have currently headed towards our southern border that regardless of the competition that we have which doesn't include criminal aliens and known gang members\nYou know we should have a need to defend our borders which is why it's so critical that were working in conjunction the department of defense to be prepared for what we're seeing at the border I mean\nThis the Caribbean is just one caravan heading north I mean every single day we're apprehending Fifteen hundred to Seventeen hundred aliens that border we're having a caravan Sasha up at our border every single day\nAnd you know it's just that a bunch of ... joined in is getting a lot of media coverage
