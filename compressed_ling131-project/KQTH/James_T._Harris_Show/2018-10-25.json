I'm hopeful I'm hopeful the more I talked to people um you know in my family and friends that live don't live in the in the twin cities area um uh they'll just say this I'm hopeful um but we you know we need to wake up\nBecause the state looks nothing like it did even Twenty years ago\nThat got your brother I appreciate your insight open line now at eighty nine four one bags editing nine four one Seventy two four seven or by the way I'm just wondering if listeners reviewers agree with me that um the ... being a nationalist or believing nationalism is a good thing in fact\nRonald Reagan after the the horrific for years of Jimmy Carter what a horrible for years that was Ronald Reagan restored nationalism and that was widely seen as a great thing you see nationalism today just thirty some odd years later and suddenly it's a horrible thing that's weird to me\nVery strange\nIt's eighty nine for one pack Joe packs dot com back at it going to be banned in uh Minnesota Dan what's up [noise] not much\nHello there that greater voice and radio today\nGood to be banned in Minnesota Dan what's up [noise] not much\nUh hello to the greater voice in radio today and they get that out first\n... always good to me or to carry who is meant to\nThat's your job is to remind our friends in a third\nOne for me by smoking or a third base in the face carry out why some of them are often [laughter] that'd be good at work for all we missed All right what's going on my man I appreciate that they talk to me\nScott so a little bit of my thunder but I I just got to say that a lot of people in Minnesota they just they don't care it's Democrat or Republican I on my team or not\nAnd I you know as I told the screener my my biggest thing has been Keith Ellison so just how Amy call but jar gets away with voting against cabinet or has mistreatment of women\nAnd same with peanuts and neither one of 'em are asked a single thing about Alison or anybody else for that matter\nIs globe ashore openly backing Ellison it 'cause I don't live in Minnesota so I don't see it is she openly backing his candidacy 'cause that would be ridiculous you\nKnow she still getting away with just not making any comment whatsoever and nobody knew they were asking the\nNo ... nobody and the meaning of will bring it up on even bring it up with Allison yeah they they'll ask a question that Allison span and then it's okay that settled ... we heard from Kate balance but now it's called and they just don't\nAsk or approach it\nEver again so for Nassau no nationalism is a good thing of course it is I mean do you love your country\nIt's always been a good thing or you know when you watch the banks are appreciated then when you watch the soccer competition I Know we keep going back to that\nBut um when you watch that when you eat food with people who were certain ethnicity or from a different country they're very proud when you liked their food very proud to present how people eat where they're from I mean there there are things about where you're from that meeting a ton to you and if you love where you're from and you should\nThen you're nationalist\nThat's good you know you could be a nationalist in Mexico and I've seen as great a nationalistic tentative I've seen this great in Russia in Germany and filling them in Australia but if you're a nationalist in the United states that means that you're Hitler\n\nCare is pretty good to be brought that up earlier ... just I could use the but how many you have to get you a buzz but let me ask you this we got you a button would you would you over use it\n[noise] like you do probably\nI don't know remaining ... sometimes he's white three times or show we use the ... ads extra fact I went that button and I want to rent grown and I would not over a million if you don't get it in a listen we'll forget it I was actually going to see what you do about it forget it no 'cause you run you over asked um\nSkills I might do Jane ... you must know what I recommend that laugh when I was giving up by ... button or would I be allowed to decide if you've ever used it and then when it was ...\nFrom the button and now you would not be allowed to do that can be punished you know not only not there would be no no button punishment know there'd be no punishment [laughter] well we\nWere listening quicker line when ... man on you know it's a editing nine four one package Joe ... one more quick one making fast for me poll in New Jersey come on\nHigh yeah real quick um why do all these big shot media people\nA quick one making ... ... New Jersey come up\nHigh yeah real quick why all these big shot media people\nThey rip Trump morning through the night and they want him to apologize for things he might have said or say or for somebody at his rallies he but meanwhile their highest paid people in the country\nAnd they rip the guy all day all night long for twenty four seven not even before he became president\nAnd now they blame everything and remember that and just remember the thing at West point where there was somebody wrote some racial slurs somebody's door right like never heard anything about that ever again\nMedia this morning I was on CNN and try to spend what I said that I called the president a liar it's not what I said the president is telling the it's like that and he's courting the truth\nIs doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger in your eyeball\nIs telling the it's like that and he's covering the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger in your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rock\nAnd and it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've done work at CNN headline news on fifty eighth over there I mean I I did that when you walk in it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there was a definitive spin\nWhen you walk into that ... did you know you were to get you know some some left hook from them and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting the that or this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figure that could kill me with base but let's find people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to\nSay listen I get fired Fifteen months ago if I wasn't loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now uh I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise] about my relationship with him you know what do you like it like it as a guy\nWhat he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were a lot younger you know his father's deceased but I'm going to get back into the seventies\nWhen his dad was working with him and mentoring in\nWhat they were like so this is a real fun book to write a ... called me yesterday uh she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent but Bush said\nIt was great each couldn't wait to show it to her father encouraged\nOr one of his best friend said the same thing you know 'cause I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing last too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nAbout it and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... of course short for Pagliaro so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like if I can tell you my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest\nOf American certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions credit president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotion feeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you are and they want that totally sanitizing\nEdited and God Forbid you should say something that they are offended by right there was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius does\nA ... and that's how people from queens or from my area your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm ... that's my personality\nI agree it's embodies or moved to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now go and get this great book let's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he said he's running for president\nMore surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty bad got were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I says there's a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies\nAnd you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThen I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely like what for a cost to now and tries to tell me your fake news oh I don't understand it and then he turned and Acosta eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again\nOh and tries to tell me your fake news ... editor in and across the eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but uh but again I thought that it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in the job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House run the price\nI thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering Bijan what Adam ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras\nBack on that first day Joe ... era as a press secretary I did the first press conference and I'm so sorry that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the ... plant\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context to\nEat was being very steep we use and flattering to me any begging me effective lead to do a profile story with him yeah trail me around and I was like well I'm not Steve Bannon\nAnd I'm not their self promoting myself when I knew some expletives which I obviously regret she loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\n... you know exaggerated article and then you really should take you know four or five days later people and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to the ambush them to see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so\nI thought it looked if you went back to the white but if you went and checked up a pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't gonna pull a bunch of ... going to be very direct you're gonna be very strict with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with a administrators and here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered\nInto a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happened to me but you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like do you want to do we want to trust people\nHe ate Joe I made a mistake it's dishes vibrant place down there I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street ... Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is\nAnd so for me uh a lot of my book is also about that ... that you know where I got up dusted by yourself off I was sort of like mayhem and they all say commercial coming through the car crash right\nAnd I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because you never want to do is be on your back for too long or you don't want that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand in sign up\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it you know as I get writing it because it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a Anthony Scaramucci the name of the book is the blue collar president I originally go ... go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the blue collar president a last question and I think people are dying to know descent but what's the relationship now with the president\nYou know I Would say it's good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... is the part of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him yeah\nI had a very good conversation with them last July recording trade I put in an op ed in the F G we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similar late\nI'm and I'm not sort of em I Hope he's not sort me for what happened he seems to be\nI get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similarly I'm and I'm not sure damn I Hope not to hurt me for what happening\nHe seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the guys like ... date bossy myself a well day was environment where he was fired I was fired I call this S P else were fired but loyal\nAnd so you know I I feel very good about the president oh he's got that one of the toughest jobs in the world you I certainly didn't want to make it harder worm I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to help do I do a lot of media certainly see through the campaign and I'm writing a lot of a bench warmer state by state\nEverybody going to get this book the blue collar president it's Anthony Scaramucci you know something that you said earlier in the interview really stuck out and it's a you know here just Fifteen months later and you're still world for the president or a summer ocean was out for Fifteen seconds and had a new book\nSo I I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you could look at me look at my listeners and look at look at my viewers and say I made a mistake\nI should have thought through that better and I really think I could have been an effective guy I agree with everything that you just said I think that's also\nGot on the mistakes you make in life you're going to tell my kids to be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one last thing which I think you would appreciate growing up the way you did and as a whole list of the reasons you know whining and sports of politics Joe ... facts are going to win five I'm Sorry to tell you gee\nWell I don't know I'm a big Yankee fan obviously but but if it's gonna be the ... anybody attribute the red Sox because they'd be the edges\nOf just like you know to like a machine that they were like last night so to me\nNo whining and spores and ...

you\nYou know ... ... like ... who was a it was a Democrat if I Lived in ... county I would've voted for him and I'm a conservative but I also know that he's a conservative and he was a blue dog

all this makeup on in the late ... and address that looked like the one that Katy Perry still where with a bang\nAnd he likes he likes to drink a little hard to think\nUh well we have you used to convince me that he's drinking it on the show half the time it's like let me have a drink so not be so he really use that guy\nHe totally\nKnow what kind of interaction do you have with the coach ... does he really sit down and said do it this way do it that way what are your ideas on this let's arrange it together or is it kind of like for Fifteen minutes with the with the advisor before the show is there really a relationship there\n[noise] well um with ah some coaches I mean I can only speak\nDirectly about like yeah like it's very he's he's engaging the hands off when it comes to creativity or a ... he knows well especially with me he knows that I'm grown ass man I'm gonna do it I'm going to do and he's he's he doesn't try to get too much in in the way\nAt when I have a direction I'm kind of bull headed to like um ... all one form can he lets me fly whereas like Adam are you know I've got some friends that aren't team at him and he is really in the trenches with either playing guitar he\nHe's trying to arrange the song let's say you know so every coaches different styles and an approach is with me like it's pretty hands off\nIn ... again it's a day Finley idea you'd be a first name last name Finley ... go follow me ... all of a social media and vote for him on a on the voice when when it comes time for the live shows hopefully are you going to be in a life just as this maybe you're on the live shows now that you made it through the battle rounds\nNo there's another round called the knockout round that goes I think it goes like everything starts at twelve I think he goes like well that's forty eight people total right I think I think he is forty eight thirty six twenty four twelve okay ten ten eight for one so I think voting starts at twenty four\nAnd when it comes to the song selection is that's widely important and and sometimes I mean I I I think that you actually did this the other night you're like okay so what's the process here [noise] um ... what is the thought process do you have him put them on the song choice this lake say I had this election I chose this song and you're going to do it how does that work\nWith that but I you know unveiling too much behind the curtain at every most things are collaborative okay but the battleground the battleground was completely the coaches discretionary choice we had a zero input Blake was like ...\n... he picks for reasons and uh and he's proud of it and I thought it was I thought it was a very interesting choice is probably not that I ever would have thought to sing but it gave me the chance to do the low notes and it gave me a chance to the it was very rare it goes range you know give me a lot of it gave me a shot\nBut what's interesting about a day because again correct me if I'm wrong but I think you actually say what were you thinking on this one [laughter]\nI didn't want to sound offensive [laughter] I'm not sure but I mean 'cause I mean case is not a country guy at All right how do you keep ... so my opponent there my friend and uh and now you got\nKeith is not a country guy at All right how do you keep ... so my opponent there\nMy friend and and now you got stolen by the amount of which is amazing right yeah but yeah he wasn't country at all so I was very confused by the ... by the thought process I was like man as he\nTotally just trying to throw me a softball here yeah and in and screw over Keith ... is way right it turns that turns out that Keith was the one who had a loan out in his audition is blind audition race\nI think Blake actually thought this\nWould suit Keith better because of the loan and then we just had to flip it and I make it really cool current feeling song\nAnd it's interesting that each day family from San Antonio by way of Nashville he's on the voice on NBC Monday Tuesday is invention probably Wednesdays when the knockout rounds and with a live show started happening you mentioned keep a loose so your competitor you said that he's your friend and you know ... that's the guy standing in the way\nSo it's for me and I've got friends that are talk show host so I don't I don't hate other people who do what I Do but at the same time I want better ratings than them you guys really do make personal relationships\nYou know it's so funny you ask because when I Would watch the show I'm a fan of the show anyway yeah I watch it before and I see somebody get eliminated as the other person one gets sad then I'll be like what the hell [laughter]\nDoesn't make any sense but when you get out to LA in your building these bonds people yeah there's a lot of time spent in any of the personalities and we're all working towards the same goals same path and we're going to lean on each other after the show's over because there's only one winter yeah I mean everybody else is going to have to lose you know so\nThe fact that we've become this kind of really great friendship community he only lives a couple of hours away so we we talk almost every day I mean we're we're just a great friends and I've done that with lots of of the other people on the show\nThough that's really cool which they friendly he's doing great on the voice on NBC\nSo I mean obviously you want to win but there's also a byproduct of you're getting all this incredible publicity publicity you couldn't buy a and and you know people are seeing new to the tune of as you said millions and millions of people watch the show they loved that show they're tweeting about it are you getting recognized out there have you heard from anybody else in the industry saying hey I think you have something win or lose let's talk I mean how's that going\nYou know that it's getting exciting you know to to say the least you know there has been some recognition here and there there has been more sold out shows that I've never done before ... am starting to make you know certainly ways ...

Guatemala [noise] that\nThat we have to feel so guilty that we weren't born in Guatemala and then other people were that we need to just welcome everybody who's marching in a big group cross the border I notice how we never offers any solution oh we'll we'll deal with that he says [noise]\nIn other news that we are actually have to cover on the show beyond a allowing one free to dominate the news cycle of this\nCaravan continues its way up in up north and it broke early this morning that general Madison is expected to send the eight hundred more troops to the southern border\nA defense secretary Mattis is expected to sign a deployment order a that could send eight hundred or more troops to the border with Mexico to help border patrol authorities stopped this caravan the officials tell CNN final details are being worked out including where the troops will come from and their specific tasks\nNot yet clear if part or all of the new deployment will be federally activated National Guard forces or in fact active duty troops\nThe troops will not engage in lethal operations to stop the migrants [laughter] instead they're expected to provide fencing wall materials and other technical support oh that's ... that's going to work at several points along the border where does believe the migrants may try to cross\nThe troops will also provide tents and medical care for border authorities in those areas\nThe troops retain the right\nAh as it says of self defense\nBut border patrol officers will still be the one physically stopping illegal migration\nFrom Warren proposition for a wait and other propositions go to one of our one Jake UGA dot com\nI'm John Henderson endorsing my wife on a Henderson for state representative not just because they care about her because she

Henderson vote on a Henderson for state representative paid for by like ten or saying\nHey it's not Russell promoting the menu live but I Want you to join the on Saturday and by the I'm from I live broadcast from the rockabilly and blues barbecue at low it's been ten of Kenyan resort it's the most delicious our on radio and it's only here on one ... one cake UTA\nOne your mid\nTerm election destination said\nJeeze among the twenty five most influential women in the GOP and she's on right now it's so Laura Ingraham show on one of the Baldwin Jake UGA [noise]\nCall Laura now one eight five five forty Laura\n[noise]\n\n\nI spend a lot forty eight hours with a was all these immigrants and by the way they are not criminals and they're no terrorists they're not even ... they're refugees [noise] women\nCriminal thing\nMe it is [noise]\nIs is not that many I mean this is a good people here have used to\nTo Mexico and then we just have but that doesn't mean that everybody is claiming\nYou're listening here helping radio addiction Hillary anger and show a five five forty Laura other news is that another caravan has formed and apparently is honest way [noise] to the United states\nFive forty Laura other news is that another caravan has formed and apparently is on his way [noise] to the United states of why what ... what I mean why wouldn't people come to think about it [noise] they know they can stay they know they just have to show up\nAnd they're going to be given a asylum interview they state they have credible fear they give it a few talking points that are already given to them on the way by immigration activists and then they get waved into the country they get a driven to a bus depot they get a bus ticket and then they're off\nSo why wouldn't all of Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras eventually figure out a way to get to the border\nAnd come into the United states they're not going to be deported unless they commit a violent crime and even then they have\nSanctuary states and cities who won't hold individuals once they're released so they can be picked up by ice and deported\nSo we're making\nIt an obvious choice for people who want to come to the United states and not go through legal channels we're we're we the people of this country if we don't get leaders in place who do this job right then we're going to see our country ultimately lost\nTo illegal immigration we have now more than twenty two million people who are illegal aliens living in the United states many of them have children who then have family ties here they've worked here are some of them criminals the lion share or not but there are here and they're not going anywhere\nSo the question is it true just drop all pretense of a border at this point in my ... I mean you can see the art and it's just easier at this point they wouldn't have a border okay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want that there was a great\nPiece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans most\nJust published yesterday and the reason for this is that\nMost illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market first and because black American a labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector that same urban areas\nWhere illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlapping competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still for low skill black workers it's obvious that the major loser in this competition\nAre low skilled black workers'\nWages are under cut by people who prefer to be paid in cash or we have fix Social Security numbers and African Americans are and other poor Americans are\nLeft to deal with this it's wildly unfair uh Bob in Florida on line four\nAnd I will tell you this ah Rhonda Santas is the only choice for Florida\nOr we're gonna play the sound from a last night's debate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum completely and I played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and those who seek\nPolitical favors are political consideration which that shouldn't in of itself that should be disqualified and he's blaming race of course for any question about his ethics\nSo we'll play the race card or a soundbite more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome\n[noise] they were you know you bring it up as Andrew Gillum gets elected up without a leash Florida with like ... that's that's just the first point but fell ... about all these people are going to be down there at the border walking and people will take them into his all that of all those ...\nIt's the first point what felt like I said about all these people are going to be down there at the border walking and people will take them into his little bit of all those people are called the cheese steaks\nAnd they want to be part of us without carrying American flags why are they all carrying flashing their own country slugs around they don't want to come here to be Americans do you want to come here to take what we have ... [noise]\nWell some excellent points now carrying the Honduran flag other blue flags that's a blue wave blue wave of foreign foreign flags\nOn the Democrats know this has trouble uh ... why haven't authorities given us more information about what's in these packages that's a good question people are asking that Lou Dobbs tweeted about that whether they're a hoax or were actual bombs\nThey were clearly what the timing and the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talk about election meddling\nIn a violent attempted violence attempted intimidation attempted terrorizing I'm ... I mean we we do deserve information's probably faster than we are getting it but I think they don't want to copy cats\nAnd so forth so I understand that as well oh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma Theresa welcome for [laughter]\nI Would like to hear these who are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly ask how much of your personal time in your personal many\nDo you spend on humanitarian causes and helping your fellow man I have all ideas it's not very much it's just the sound bite for them and they really have no care for those that are around them they don't have a charity in their hearts it's all about political maneuvering\nThat's a great point well I think again if you if people are willing to sponsor\nIndividuals who apply for legal of entry into the United states sponsor them economically sponsor their education sponsor their learning English and be fit financially accountable for them\nAnd also civil reliable if they commit crimes I don't think you'd see many people signing up I mean we know they enforce\nTheir their perimeter around their house with alarms and fences and gates and and servants [laughter] I mean these people have more more of a perimeter then the White House and they're complaining about our border being enforced or say it's not fair\nI don't know how many people John Case that has taken into his own uh his own you know governor's mansion and made him sure you can take in a few it's pretty nice house\nIt's a great point All right you're listening to the lawyer and grim show a very tight race in Indiana and we're going to talk to Mike ... a bronze who's challenging the Democrat incumbent Joe Donnelly its its neck and neck it's up to point down two points\nSo this is a tight race we're going to talk to Mike about Indiana as a ... it's a reliably red state meeting a conservative state so why should there be any question that the governor of that great state where Mike Pence came from of course a should also not be a Republican strong conservative\nAnd what what Indiana and think a today\nExcuse me ... ... excuse me for the Democrat or income and said I said governor I'm so happy governor on my mind\nA so obviously Joe Joe Donnelly for the Senate race but I said that but I'm All right we're going to take a break eight five five forty Laura will bring you the latest updates on the tracking of these packages the political timing is very strange\nBut to take a break a five five forty Laura will bring you the latest updates on the tracking of these packages the political timing is very strange and a lot more coming up\n\n\nTimeshare honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your contract for the next set of fees contact resort released today\nYou know and a half to want to North Dakota\nAnd Missouri and we feel real good about it a momentum uh everything on our side and I really believe\nOne in North Dakota and Missouri and we feel real good about it a momentum uh everything on our side and I really believe we're going to win\nSo your opponent says like well he supports Trump to does he\n[laughter] well only on the stuff that doesn't count a\nVoted against tax reform and you know it was for Obamacare all the stuff that's really important he's a hundred percent lined up with Chuck Schumer and the liberal side of his party and that record being fully flushed out here uh through this campaign and\nThat's the reason we're going to win it with or without the cabin all\nYou know bomb but uh just a lot of good things have happened we brought a good campaign and we've resource to competitively in great fundraising and\nNot a whole lot different than executing a business plan and uh we feel good about where we are\nA well Mike the concern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and\nUh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or in what what is your take on this the criticism of the president was almost instantly even though he condemned this of course and ask for national unity it was not good enough or and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere\nThat resulted in these a package is being sent\nOn the president's been blamed for everything gets knowing knowledge meant for the main thing he's done the reason I'm running is\nUh I wouldn't be running for ah invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity to kind of shake the system and fix what's broken and uh he they're still re litigate again I think the two thousand sixteen race and that's why he gets\nNo credit for the great agenda that's out there that are\nExciting who's yours and he was popular in sixteen here among conservatives and even more so and I even think the people that maybe don't love his style are going to look at the results and uh\nI think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly has tried to become so Trump being when you know you never you know it's been always with the liberal side of his party's so uh\nUm I think this is just another example of how they try to distract than ah give him absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said not today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence sourcing for the first time in different ways well this is a year plus after Steve ... was almost killed\nAt the hands of a rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened if that guy wasn't style of the security they would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean it's a litany of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the cabinet and hearings and olive is challenging Democrats in each red states or the amount of just absolute negative uh lives and distortions that\nSchumer's packs dump into George Soros than the rest of 'em uh\nI think it's exposed and ugly underbelly of uh what they're about which is a lack of any message a completely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda\nAnd I think voters are going to hold them accountable uh I think ah the Kavanaugh hearings for who's yours would have been part the point where our race changed in many others and I think enough\nBrings for who's yours would have been part the\nPoint where our race changed and many others and I think enough was enough for him they related back to my race and many others I saw something Fox dead on across the board the negative advertising that just swamped you on the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nA proposal to actually advance our economy or or grow our prosperity earned forced the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to personal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade\nHe won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything any time anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took on the health insurance companies about\nTen years ago to make sure you know be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail make a big government hooked up with big health care is specifically insurance and I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage\nAnd Lara held premiums flat for ten years\nAnd it's the absolute truth and it's kind of blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative\nActually mine out of a solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was made of consumer driven made a transparent\nThe kinds of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result I go to the Senate I'll talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race against the guy like Joe Donnelly and it's been a career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progress the result the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on his heels and constantly apologizing I mean that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like someone like a John ... forever back on his heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump's is not going to do that and that drives a left crazy and he calls them out and and I think it's a little\n... pass the time we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWell I mean thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an alarm the other thing you're going to get this agenda\nReally healed then I talk about tax reform and I do think it's a incumbent upon conservatives are business owners now that you got more Django in your pocket share it with your employs we've done that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping them flat for ten years and I've preached out all the time you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated we've had ten months people now adding up more money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us that ... gone out there and touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employers\nPeople quit looking to the false hope of a federal government that the Democrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really put us on the brink of\nA financial calamity if we don't get more people in there that are going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going and there'll be more of us I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and\nJoined the Trump trains\nWhy I'm going you know there'll be more obvious but I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and joined the uh your Trump trains so I'm looking for\nAfter well we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're going to win this race or the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get to the polls vote for in advancing economy at an America\nThat's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go backwards to more identity politics more mass illegal immigration got to deal with this with the new Congress close these loopholes\nAnd Mike Brown would be fantastic in the U.S Senate I I just can't wait for you to come to Washington I think you're going to win this Mike\nAnd I'm I'm so glad we're in we're going to win it\nAnd I'm looking forward to it in a lower thanks for the support and we're going to finish a part in the tape on the six and a can't wait to be a reinforcement for a great agenda\nWhen did you graduate from a H. B.

D. or telling\nOfficers not to go to bully or anywhere near polling places\nWell the cheese\nNow I Can't think of any reason why an essay NPT police officer would go to a polling place if not called there unless he or she is going to vote and I don't know what the what the legalities are or the rules and regulations are the dress code is for police officer I don't know if you can carry the you know can you go and vote if you're in uniform I don't know\nI Do not now\nI voted for very long time I've never seen a police officer in uniform voting but nobody's even alleging that the allegation by walking Castro who has a real problem with reality is that police officers were purposely patrolling inside of the parking lots of polling places\nAnd his allegation his suggestion was that they were trying to intimidate people and if you see something like this happen to get a hold of me that he signs it Joaquin as if he's a friend of everybody\nWell again let me reiterate the police chief tells me that the police department is not a political um outlet there is no political basis for what they do they are there to protect and serve\nAnd he says they were not told to stay away from all polling places\nHe said they very simply had been told that they may tell told the other day you go to where you're called or you need it\nAnd guess what carry the ball at a polling place and I feel like a crime is being perpetrated on me I Will call the police of the polling places and then we'll do manage tells me they'll come\nBut other than that there really is no role the police department has at a polling place this thing by the far left writers in the city news reporters in the city and by walking Castro himself this has been reported as somehow they told the police to stay back away from polling place to protect your right to vote\nFor what I get from the chief there was no order that walking Castro could give her that he gave saying you are not allowed to be anywhere near a polling place that just simply doesn't appear to me what happened here and I believe the guy\nHe doesn't have a good reason to lie to me and I just now I I'm just now getting indication that in fact police can vote in their uniforms so if you're voting a UC believes that will show up in uniform get in line to go vote tough as his or her right to go and do that\nAnd and by the way if you're voting and you see a police officer or pass by on the road there are allowed to be there and people patrol now they're in the parking lot you've got a question as to why freak and ask them\nI've never heard of ... a police officer look at me in San Antonio or any other city usa and say I'm not going to talk to your citizen they don't do that\nSo again no political role for the police department they were not told don't patrol anywhere near a polling place and to be in the parking lot of a polling place they have every right to be there if they'd been cold there\nNow walking Castro in my opinion is starting trouble they keep in mind that the guy is he's a scary cat he's a he's a scared little guy he only talked to people on the left the only talk to people that he thinks of the things that grief is what I had people on the show all the\nTime the phone lines are open now call it an disagree with me I have every\nEvery desire to mix it up with somebody who disagree that a great you know back and forth today with a great friend of mine about an issue we can do that walking Castro's and that kind of guy he doesn't have the vertebrate to do it doesn't have the spine to do it but this whole allegation that he somehow is giving orders to to the city over to the police department\nI wouldn't buy it if I were you\nAnd and let me finish on this no this is my personal opinion if you've got a problem or you're scared when you see a police officer the problem is with you it's not necessarily with him or her now they're acting out and they're misbehaving in and doing something outside of the realm of their job I'll listen to you and sometimes that happens\nFor now they're acting out and they're misbehaving in and doing something outside of the realm of their job I'll listen to you and sometimes that happens but stop all this you know\nThe people versus the bleach Joaquin Castro want you to be afraid of and hate the police and I'm here to tell you don't be look what the less what I have it on that but I'm not afraid of the police you shouldn't be eight eight nine four packs a day nine four one Seventy four seven Joe packs dot coms there either\n[noise]\nSo\nIn many bedrooms

Thirty years ago most of our immigration were single men coming from Mexico right right now half\nOf the immigrants are coming from Central America and many of them are coming with women and children because they know that if they get detained\nWe under court order and law cannot send them back right so they just release them into the middle of the country and with a wink and a nod hope you come back and a couple three four years when your court hearing comes around\nJust not sustainable long term and so we want to be strong we want to be compassionate we can do both of those things but we just got to get enough conservative and it's just common sense voices right in Congress to be able to get it done\nAs you know I grew up in South Florida that's when the when the Mariel boatlift happened in Nineteen eighty we saw all of these people from Fidel Castro's prisons heading north to Miami we detain than we put them in\nWhen the Mariel boatlift happened in Nineteen eighty we saw all of these people from Fidel Castro prisons heading north to Miami we detain than we put them in the chrome detention center because we didn't know the word turned out there were a lot of bad people that that came on the Mariel boatlift some good people too but a lot of bad ones came\nA but political asylum from a place like Cuba made sense political someone from the Soviet Union made sense political asylum from Cuba or from China made sense\nIf you're coming from Honduras and you tell reporters who asked you while you're coming but you're looking for a better job and maybe better schools for your kids that's not about political asylum is at work\nNow and and and no one fault them for wanting to come to be part of the nine but you know legally yeah ... and and we've always been open and welcoming welcoming\n... are they we shouldn't be giving them asylum should we\nKnow that for ... ... per persecution for religious reasons for I'm ... from criminal activity from political persecution and that's not what they're facing I understand America is doing great and it's even doing better because of the president than it ever done before you know but that's still not a reason to break the law and come here illegally\nAnd so the president is taking the tough action he's ordering\nThe military to go in and help support\nOur customs and border patrol agents as they defend our border but he's going to be very strong in this matter in that we're going to we're going to secure our country we're going to protect Americans because it's not just about immigration about drug slowly again it's about lower wages for those who are already\nStruggling to climb off the lower rungs of of the of the economic ladder right all of these things matter we can do it but people have got to come out and vote to do it\nHe's at M. A. R. C. underscore a low T T E R is from a GOP is also a way or the former press secretary for vice president Mike Pence uh when when it comes to\nThese bombs that are being sent around or what looked like bombs really even really know what the story's yet but they're still investigating it it's very early this investigation thank God nobody was hurt thank God none of them are detonated and maybe we can go all sorts of information off of these packages and so on\nWhat do you make a mark I know that you deplore is happening I don't want anybody sending bombs and either you knew it as the president or the vice president but that that's a that's a given for more people\nBut what do you make of the media actually I saw a headline today that said um bombs sent to Trump opponents ... I mean they're they're making this all about the president as if he's got an even to say about it I don't remember anybody saying rock Obama or Hillary Clinton simply got to go shoot up baseball practice so what's the story here how do they get away with this\nWell and they control and write their own narrative and and I'll tell you in and you're absolutely right I was with the vice president yesterday with the story was break you know he immediately got in touch with the White House to get the latest information and went and talked about it can damned those actions as the president has done as well and\nMade sure that the full resources of the of the federal government are activated Naples to help in the ... but what the media some in the media have done I Believe is ill ... ill informed too irresponsible\nBecause we have seen violence Steve ... was shot\nIn nearly died you know I don't see the outrage when Donald Trump junior and Eric Trump and their families were exposed to threats that came through the mail what about Susan Collins who had death threats and Chuck Grassley who had death threats they did not\nCall out that in nearly as much time and if this person we don't know what their motivation was right but I don't care their politics or their profession\nYou do it you're going to get caught and you're going to have the full weight of the justice system brought down on you as you could I don't care who you are right by what we cannot have is people assigning blame and trying to score political points on it before we even know anything about this suspect\nRight by what we cannot have is people assigning blame and trying to score political points on it before we even know anything about this suspect\nBut it's actually disgusting and this is from political or hey you may want to be able to disenfranchise or actually just incentivize the right Republicans conservatives even center right people in center left people were going to vote for him for Republicans or conservatives they need to do whatever they can\nAh through their reporting to make us not go out and that's why I think that we have to keep on telling the story the tax cuts and so on ... about that let me just ask you very quickly I've got Kevin Brady tomorrow the house ways and Means Committee chair he's a great guy from the Houston or even a ...\nI'm In Texas we go way back and I love how he how he formed the tax cuts the first time around mark I pay attention and stuff I didn't realize until recently there is a tax cuts to point do\nThat still is yet to be put into place that's really in jeopardy if the mid term should go the wrong way I'm Talking about the economy talking about the injured it's become the steamboats gain and what more tax cuts especially for middle class families will mean\nAbsolutely the first cut rather tax cuts and we didn't cut taxes at every level it's like the president promised but there was also considerable tax cuts to unlock the potential of our economy right was the corporate tax rate and some of how we tax a corporate earnings that really has what\nIs unleashing the power of the economy getting businesses to invest\nHire people give raises bonuses all of those things are great\nTax cuts to point out the president not only wants to make the individual tax cuts permanent that have already been passed but he also wants to given a given extra incentive for those middle class families who are working every day to pay to pay their bills their mortgage put their kids through college and school those things that many of us worry about living paycheck to paycheck\nThat's the one he wants to really focus in on and we already know that if the Democrats take over they want to undo tax cuts they don't want to do another round they may not even want to make the current ones permanent\nThen there'll be ... they're going to be said they're going to get rid of him they wanted to market as a guy who's been campaigning for a long time and and you know how this works could you ever see being in a campaign room and and and somebody shouting out hey\nI've got an idea on how we can win let's take money out of their paychecks that'll be a winning how does it work\nWho is the brainchild in the left or maybe they shouldn't stop because it's going to be winning combination for us but who was the brainchild they thought taking away the tax cuts that extra money your paycheck your four O. one K. going up your company have any more money to pay you who thought that was a good idea I don't get it\nI have no idea but they've actually even just tried to get away from that now\nNow it's just all about free stuff and and with their drive to cure socialism with trillions upon trillions of dollars a cough and when you ask them how they're going to pay for it they looked like a deer in headlights no uh it's so it's really just such fiscally fiscal irresponsibility coming from the far left in the end the socialist\nThat it doesn't even warrant in a you know an academic discussion 'cause there's nothing behind those thoughts but again as I look out there I saw yesterday I've seen it on the campaign trail so many times\nThere's a lot of energy out there I think it's translating into the polls it's going to translate into the into the election results on Tuesday and\nEverybody who's listening from Michigan to Texas Indiana and beyond your vote is going to count don't vote alone bringing for ... and do whatever you can get to the bowl\nThat last quick question quick answer if you don't mind it my over exaggerating when I say if the left or to get the house and or the Senate the economic boom we're seeing right now would stop\n[noise] uh I wouldn't I Would definitely put a dent into it I'm not going to stop because remember I\nWe're seeing right now would stop\n[noise] uh I wouldn't I Would definitely put a dent into that I'm not going to stop because remember I I don't think they're going to win the Senate or only be able to get the house yeah but they could they could let taxes expire or they could try to hold the government hostage for some other crazy ideas in\nBudget bills and things were going to have to get everybody to agree so let's not take the chance for now even entertain that thought okay I Do not give Speaker Pelosi the gavel back\nOh that just eat it hurts me
