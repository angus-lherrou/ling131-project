trend last night because a lot of national money has been with this way [noise] thirty eight million dollars\nTo work alone in a way it was just an odd debate to me it was an odd debate for him I just felt like he didn't do well at all and then I see all these news headlines today was ... de la Cruz was savaged by O'Rourke no no he wasn't\nNot even a little bit I mean and it's so odd that I think they think if they reported that way it'll just be told that way\nI actually went to the guy today wrote that Savage to him I said what do you do some guy it'd be independent which I think is in in oc carry mhm and billionaire and the u._k. yeah\nHe he's the one the road or Savage cruised by calling the lion dead\nHe called them lying dead when he got some big exactly right the person who is Locke was O'Rourke who said that he voted for this ten dollar a barrel tax on a barrel of of oil that was\nProduced here in Texas\nAt a record little liar and then you know cruises Easter was what would what is going to get on to my website you'll see the actual legislation and the actual vote edits him and he did do it but he's also said that his mother was a lifelong Republican middle we voted Democrat for him for the first time ever a at again in two thousand eight she voted for um\nFor ... someone on nobody's talking about his ... his mother said I wasn't a Republican also an independent\nSo I mean they're just way too many problems here with this make believe Hollywood candidacies very strange to me that it's getting any traction all but the way we left off last hour was

you you've got\nA mindset that you're not understanding the way Medicaid and Medicare work the government is telling physicians\nI'm not going to pay you what it costs you to do that procedure and you know physicians are going to say screw you I'm gonna retire screw you're going to become a lawyer who you're going to be Dr race cars I don't have to be a physician and have you give me thirty dollars for a fifty dollar procedure that is what Obamacare is doing it's actually running great doctors out of the business you know that\nNo I agree with you and that's the documentation standards that are requiring but I think the other aspect of it is that\nThe insurance companies or pricing out a lot of these these procedures and because what why do they do that they put on different levels of tears and I think what you needed an open free market I agree with you you shouldn't have socialized medicine lately but you need to make it to where everybody can access it and it's not just\nJoe everybody

thousand a year in some cases have gone to two three four thousand a month\nFor a family it wasn't like that before we need free enterprise really competition when he capitalism and we need these

also former a radio talk show host than just a great guy we we think Jason loose doing a great job he's up for another challenge you use um the ease actually battling the sea woman\nThat was fighting with them for the seat two years ago not really sure why she's getting another another shot to be I guess you can keep on going I guess I guess you'd want to try and I guess but I'm pretty interesting\nI I don't I've never heard of this person the woman that he's running against but that doesn't mean anything I don't I don't live in Minnesota maybe maybe she's a big deal in Minnesota but there was a video that age Jason Lewis supporter has put together um pretty much asking who this person is\n[noise] but what the\n... regular no\nTown and correct\nWant to why you're out\nSalmon on this country into a constitutional crisis we haven't seen and we're certainly not willing to go there most people in my district don't want to go there they want the government get results not write this down\nUm and so this is a very crucial midterm I don't think people realize well actually I think they're starting to realize you thanks to people like you know what they care\nI'm with you it's Congressman Jason Lewis district to Republican the great state of Minnesota he's running for reelection ... was the challenger she challenged him two years ago last um here's the thing\nI looked and I can't really see where she's demanded you on the issues\nAnd if we go through the history of what you've accomplished in just two years we're talking about an economy is booming like crazy lower taxes for every Minnesotan everybody who's listening who pays taxes corporate taxes lowered so we can build new jobs people getting bonuses and raises that they never expected or because of your work and because of the work of president Donald Trump\nDo people understand exactly how good it is ... and here's the second part of it is there a fear in your mind Jason that\nPeople get fat and happy as you listened things are going great I'm not going to rock the boat and go vote\nI think up until the Kavanaugh hearings when people saw the debt almost the political depravity of what some of these folks are willing to go right I I think that might have been true I Do think people on our side\nAre are realizing just how crucial this mid term is but you still got to get out and vote and you're quite right about our accomplishments is not only getting the economy going again at four four and a half percent at six percent increase in ... after tax take home pay right it's about current technical education which I've let on I got a bill passed that includes our language in it\nIt's about work in a criminal justice reform it's\nAbout reforming the metropolitan counseling which here in Minnesota is on a buck and citizens in the second district know all about that\nBut my opponent doesn't want to take a stand on anything least about Medicare for all socialized medicine least of all sanctuary cities and building a border wall even though she's taking money from Christian ... right at least of all things she's going to impeach and vote for Nancy Pelosi\nSo what they're going to do jog guarantee it it will find more old radio clips they can throw out there because they are standing for nothing they have NO PLAN except to attack and smear\nWell how did things change should she God Forbid win the race I mean the people who are listening and you know highly rated we are no keep you okay and everyone else in Minnesota people are listening closely right now how bad could things get if the the left does in fact when the house if you're on seed in which I don't think should happen\nWell look if the if the Democrats take over the house and my opponent is elected and vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker what you will have given that the tens of thousands of dollars Pelosi now she she goes out at another below sea fundraiser this cycle you are so that will happen\nYou will see the country grind to a halt if you think the Kavanaugh hearings were good for America you'll love of the house under Nancy Pelosi and Angie crate\nThat as a fat and that's what's on the ballot in November it's as simple as that you want chaos you want resistance you aren't riots or do you want results\nAnd and those are all great questions and you're actually you are absolutely spot on I've been calling us the Kevin I'll bounce um\nFort unfortunately it happened for him and his family end unfortunately it happen for for for ... before she was used as much as he would use when Spartacus as things like it doesn't really matter at this point if he's innocent or guilty we just have to stop the Americans on both sides including those who are center left\nSaid enough I can vote for these people I don't like what just happened that it happened too far away though because that that will be four weeks out when we finally get to the election are people going to be motivated\nI Hope they do sometimes it takes a while for the stuff to sink in you know but certainly walk some folks up your right but I think more than anything else the cabin I hearing or a microcosm of of quite frankly these liberal tactics going back for years and years\nBut I think more than anything else the cabinet are you hearing or a microcosm of of quite frankly these liberal tactics going back for years and years and years for the migration twenty sixteen\nWe we just people knew Jason Law as well as they listen to me for two decades on the radio like they listen to you and when these attacks almost eight million dollars worth of attacks taking my worked out of context came out they said\nI mean that's how the Jason we know yeah and I won I Won the race well now they've been lifted the national media and anybody they can find the national media has become the opposition research arm of the Democratic party's you know and now they're trying to regurgitate that because that's the only play book they've got\nIt can't afford to come out and say hey I'm for sanctuary cities and it gets border security I'm for socialized medicine that will end Medicare as we know and then kick people out there or if they can't they get 'em or nasty below the speaker so we can have a constitutional impeachment crisis and I'm for packing the Supreme Court right I Can't say that so they attack\nAnd take worked out of context and and ... anything they can find and that the bankruptcy the allergies\nIt is a Congressman Jason Lewis this or this or to Republican or a state of Minnesota I Hope you vote for him on on election day coming up the returns zero November six I'm ... you're right and ... it's actually the same story but we see here in Texas where I Am with this guy Robert Francis awoke he's calling himself Beto\nHe's acting like he's Hispanic use fourth generation Irish nothing wrong with being an Irish but but I mean why why pretend you're something else but he hasn't said anything\nAnd when he's called he got it all about identity politics\nExactly well it's about identity politics I'm Hispanic Robert Kennedy which makes no sense he's not as ... I also in bringing flowers in rainbows and squirrels\nAnd he's not saying anything other than hoping changing let's work together well he or impeachment while he's for abolishing ice while he's against a border wall I mean we have down at least for raising your taxes is that exactly who you're dealing with ... and it was nice it she not seeing any of those things\nAnd that's precisely how do you take money from Kirsten Gillibrand is leading the charge for abolishing eyes yeah and then saying well I I really haven't taken a position on that how do you say I Want to work towards a single payer system and then say well but I wouldn't vote for the current plan\n... it's just that you watch a lot I don't think we're so they don't have to take a position that's unpopular and so they just attack and by the way all the while raising record amounts of money the likes of which no political cyclists ever seen right wow they run with Citizens United\nPlastered all over their their their bumper stickers how you run out of getting money out of politics and set record after record in fundraising for special interests\nHave you guys debated at all\nYeah we've already got one in the can it'll be airing next week and the other one or two more um but\nAre you going to be looked at her and take a position or not they're going to say she were\nI think I think the one we've already take Joe I think people will uh will see that she doesn't want to take a position\nBecause and and that's what people need to see we need to make sure that we expose the Web look if she's really taking positions that you really believes in these things and people in Minnesota want to vote for that which would be ridiculous you know that's fair it's not fair to lie about it get into office and become Nancy Pelosi on steroids that doesn't make sense\nWhen she first decided to run Jon Klein was in the seat before he retired yeah and she said one of the reasons he wanted to run because Klein opposed the Obama amnesty plant\nAnd that was just untenable for that now she's only been out of course right so it's just it it is you know I'm just going to ride the blue wave and not take a position that I'll vote for Nancy Pelosi I'll abolish ice I'll adopt sanctuary cities are socialized medicine once I get there but you're not going to know it then it sort of like you know Obamacare will know what when we read it\nIt is a Jason Lewis I use a representative district to Republican the great state of Minnesota before I let you go I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the Keith Ellison wise\nIt is a Jason Lewis I use a representative district and Republican the great state of Minnesota before I let you go I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the Keith Ellison why is this guy even stay on the ticket afterward Kavanaugh was used accused of and there was no corroboration there was no proven fact I walked away saying it didn't happen\nAnd now we she Keith Ellison whose girlfriend one or former girlfriend who one would imagine agreed with him politically is out there showing pictures of her having been pummeled and this only happened a couple of years ago how is this guy in the running and might possibly become the top law enforcement officer in the state of Minnesota helped me out here\n... why have my opponent not told him to resign as she takes it all publicly on him of course not of course that she didn't take a position on Al Franken that's ridiculous and call ... took his money that had to give it back yeah took money from Garrison Keillor or lead to resign over ... charges\nCampaign with a state senator duck show on who had to resign over sexual harassment shark campaigns are key Ellison actions speak louder than words Joe and if they if if the Democrats aren't I Want to talk about sexual harassment and the serious nature of it you look at the actions versus work and it's really astounding\nI was a big fan when you were on the radio I'm certainly a big fan

like someone's getting I'm getting that done here welcome\nThank you for having me I I Would agree with everything you just said I'm so what happened is uh I I wouldn't do a local bar restaurant um they have a big\nBanquet center and I went to see if they would be interested in letting us rent that whatever for a event to have all the statewide candidates they're like a meet and greet type thing uh when I walked in someone recognized me and asked the campaign was going and\nThen people just kind of circled around I guess [noise] um [noise] one young man was asking me ... ... policy questions and then told me about himself he ended up on a yard sign so we I gave him one and then another gentleman entered the conversation and ... it was a back and forth\nSeem any thing to be worried about the ... at the time I someone said something to my right and I was talking to that gal over there and the next thing I knew he he yelled out a political statement was something to that effect do you believe in people don't give a belief about the middle class and he just sucker punch me I didn't see a comment\nAnd I was sitting hired ... chair and I went flying back and once my head hit the ground that was all I remember\nOh my gosh that and I can tell you it was a very big guy\nDid or did he\nGet out for a hundred and um they did catch up with them two days later I'm found them he basically told them that are ... the ... the deputy asked them whether or not I said or did anything to provoke him and his answer was no\n... the deputy asked them did you give them any warning prior that you were going to hit him his answer was no and then when they did but he asked him do you know where you had them and he said yeah right and right now\nSo is he arrested for assault\nThey had been arrested and charged him yet they're waiting for the uh to determine the level of a charger waiting for the medical report as well as the video surveillance\nAnd you're obviously going to testify

friend\nOh my goodness Shane or any ... sorry go ahead ... ...\nThe biggest thing is that what I mean the there's the civility seems to be gone and and I mean\nI I and I didn't get the sense that we weren't uh like minded going into it I guess are up until that point but it's just you know wail somebody in the head and send them flying is is that like I\nSaid before it's not something I was signing up for\nWell Shane ah first of all the left is trying to\nIntimidate good Americans like you've from running for office they're trying to frighten people scare them and if that doesn't work physically attacked them out of a race physically prevent you from running and this is being encouraged\nBy the Democrats at the highest levels even those who claim over not for violence of course we're not for violence than ... where are they why are they supporting this caravan approaching the U.S border\nThat is lawlessness complete and utter lawlessness they embrace lawlessness if the ends are in their minds justified noble\nSo that means are justified excuse me at the end is noble and the end is electing Democrats or you can bring more of a a social spending framework enforce that on the American people of all the goals of of of more of a democratic socialist approach to governance\nIf those are noble goals and you can get there by any means necessary including a sucker punch of someone that gives them a concussion and messes up there by\nA and this is why conservatives Republicans of all backgrounds you must ensure that these people are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law I Would file a civil suit against him a and I would I Would I Would move on that stuff I Would sue him\nFor what he did and I hope you I Hope you do that you know anything about his background\nI I really don't um I I I've heard a few things that I'm a I guess they some easing the trades of some sort that is what I've learned but beyond that I don't really know much about them ... or you know he was a fairly big guy to be on that we\nHave Democrats are in the state spoken out against us\nThat you know I I actually know so like both of our senators are Democrats and neither one of them to my knowledge as of yesterday anyway had come out and publicly denounced it um [noise] I Will say that my Congressman Tom emmer he did call me as soon as you heard about it\nWas the first time they've ever called me but it and you know give me as a condolence has the support and all that I was you know but but\nOther than you know none of none of our representation or higher up people have come out and said that to the to the last I looked at me like imagine if you would be the motor that the thing that is the norm now it just you know go out and like you said getting their faith kicking when they're down with a bit of comments or I got\nTore up for using that exact lining up Facebook response of calling out the comments from Hillary and Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and and if somebody actually starting a local publication as my understanding that how would how would their their comments have any influence in rural Minnesota\nI don't know if they don't think we don't have a radio and TV here\n[laughter] yeah so Eric Holder if they go low we kick 'em Hillary Clinton if they go low we hit harder or whatever it is she sent a right yeah well it of course\nThe low we kept come Hillary Clinton if they go low we hit harder or whatever it is she sent\nA right yeah well it of course it doesn't affect I mean I don't know about this guy I don't know what his deal is but of course it has an effect\nAnd it's meant to intimidate it is a type of political intimidation and its physical intimidation and up to the point of committing crimes\nBut again they they they attempt to dehumanize entire groups of people like if you're a conservative in Minnesota and you run for office and you and you call it as it is they have to call you a racist you they have to say that you're anti women\nAre and you might imagine what they would have done Shane if a a liberal female Muslim candidate for instance\nUh was brutalized or hit by someone else a woman as let's say a concert or just give the gender that is a conservative woman hitter said you don't you're not you're not representing my interests you imagine\nAnd I wouldn't mind you know first ones to I'd be the first one out there to condemn that physical absolutely tax\nWell I could say I certainly wouldn't wish this upon anybody I don't know and and and you know I grew up my mom was extremely liberal my entire life my dad was a totally opposite very conservative they were thought about it\nIn fact that they would tease each other you know let's go Catholic voters vote I mean it's I guess it ... this doesn't need to be everybody's everything where you don't agree with me I it's it's all out just throw down\nBattles it says\nIt's a it's a sad place when we become actually\nA shame how does your race look\nA in theory I'm going to Seventy thirty district so conservative speaking so it's a it's a strong Republican district that with the unfortunate part is we do have an independent that sought the GOP endorsement and rented an independent but by the time that\nThe the downside to this is a I ... the doctors have told me or you got to lay low you have no idea what this is I Try to tell them I only have three weeks a campaign left and I ...
