Boca\nThey do absolutely well she's got a reputation it's remarkable and it's not just the exotic tacos it's everything they do they do it so well and I loved that fourth avenue location 'cause it's

friend\nThe director of film fest Tucson herb Stratford getting ready for a huge we can next week you absolutely yet we're we're getting there almost ready for ya third annual I'm shuttering to think\nWhat you and your team have a plan for the fourth annual but I Know you're well on your while you're probably thinking two more years that are absolutely that's our role well here's another guy who ah roles for a living here because he's shaking hands during and everything in between is one of the longtime managers\nHere and rock a little Chicago and uh and really amazing behind them ... movement that has really taken over\nPut your hands together and about it is there at a screening\nIn what many line they do not I\nMean the only one drinking October fest on his patio I mean this is great stop no no you're not the only ones who are going to visit all bad on tap continuously for about three weeks to find out the door I think it's so you know what let's talk about my\nVery first rock those light age and experience it was a long time ago oh and I believe a ... that you might have had the three beers available and I think old style and ... our two of them and and\nI I certainly I certainly understand and I appreciate and I celebrate the fact\nI haven't seen in there are people in this community that really that they're from Chicago there from Chicago land they really have to have that that mid west fear experience so you get the people what they want a ... year old so I don't see it's easy to drink a better than PBR [laughter]\nHow many all styles selling on a given weekend rocket will Chicago oh God if it really depends on the week uh some weeks we're also six or seven cases in a week oh yeah\nOh yeah All right yeah okay so you got the old school Ruth thing down ah Schlitz is now it's not just still considered a malt liquor no oh no it's a real beard isn't actually you know there are so they made some progress up or what you got the old school Ruth thing down here I think as we said when you're coming to experience that Wendy sending wisdom\nIt got to come out with some of those old school Bruce but I think your craft to be your program has gone through the roof since the last time Oh absolutely um ever since I've been here I mean I've been here for Thirteen Years we've always had a pretty decent craft Bruce election but yeah lately\nBecause of the explosion of you know local brewery\nWe're getting a really wide variety of really tasty really different beers um you know like\nA few years ago nobody heard of a sour AOL\nBut now they're all the rage you know right yeah I mean I Am seeing the board and brewed beer battle at a hotel Congress to my mind the fifth year and seeing that and it's interesting to see how trend dictate what the brewers are bringing to events like that and then I Would never sours and surround sound\nOver Oh absolutely areas like sour guy on the spectrum I'm I like a good salary here and there uh you know it's got to be the right kind but you know some of some of the local breweries um especially like um cricket teams there those guys are really doing great job that\nCloud people sour I I haven't gotten on this hour bus yet oh you know and and kind of a widespread way with the crooked tooth a class of people I I have and that's that is found favor or with me now we talked with her Stratford a little bit about\nHow how does he decides what films that he's going to happen to line up for the third annual film fest these these are under films a year he can't show for hundreds domes three days you're Tucson so there's a science that goes with the kind of films that he's dial up for the event\nHow do you decide how you hear right your craft beers a menu when you know there's so many different personalities so many different palettes how do you drill down\nI was just you know we're going to spread it out we tried to keep a a good variety of some staples you know you always got to have an IP a I was going to have something dark usually a lawyer and then you know just fill in the arrest\nYou and I see it as hop I notice a lot of the brewers are are kind of dialing back their kind of the big at least on the double I. T. A. yeah it's hard to find a nine point five percent a DVD idea in town anymore\nYeah it is I think it's I think a lot of people burning out on that on that super hopped flavor I'm Ryan ... ideas are getting a little more nuanced in their in their their palate notes or were they hit so we're\nTalking about nuance and notes uh in in a in a conversation about beer I Love that\nYou wouldn't be able to do this ten years ago yeah huh well I'm run out of town right\nCraft cocktails piece at a pizza joint Evans databases right well let me understand\nWe got the bar so why not how long have you had the bar it's only been like five years it's been that long fibers I wouldn't want your cocktail program to be known for I mean what are the kinds of expressions\nAh that you're a you know introducing to your uh search the patriots and we'd\nWe'd like to serve things that they've had before but with just a little different twist you know we make a mosquito that's on them in on the menu but at the ... [noise]\nUm [noise] just because you know we don't need meant for anything else so [laughter] we got a hung debate on the ... so that makes it easy I'm Marguerite as you know we did a margarita competition every year we just try to make something different [noise]\nUm we've done uh they think the very first one we had was a spicy Faisal margarita and that's still popular to this day are done like a chocolate bidders margarita\nAnd sort of play around with it just do things that people like and if they like it it'll stay on the menu if they don't like it will take it off with something new and its place how many cocktails on your signature list right now [noise] [noise] oh I think including the three different margarita there's [noise] eight\nOkay pretty ... pretty number and your rotating around people who are living with now on the spirit side uh what are you working on these days you wish you and I definitely\nHave a bourbon your what do you want what do you love it on the ... oh I really like a high west is putting out yeah our City Utah favorite yeah go for their double rise sometime but yeah you know I like to mix it up I'm if I'm if I'm just drink and cheap Jim being [laughter]\nIn the in it and it takes a special go out and then all of us right on enjoy it while you know I I follow\nMy under Clinton wherever he takes me but what did that one of the primary difference is between stuff to do just because I Know there's there's some mythology or around town so let's let's set the uh settle it right here in for in\nThe deep dish is is the older of the two products it's a it's stems from the late forties from various for bears in Chicago you know there's some there's some battle over who really came up with it but pizzeria uno is probably\nThe originator right and\nSo it's it's a pan with Joe and the bottom of the pan\n[noise] then you get your cheese then you get your toppings then ... that's the original Scarlett would eat there's there are some rights even in Chicago that have cheese on top of the sauce but it's it's rare er here yeah I don't what what are they thinking [laughter]\nIn some places in Chicago is corn meal and across\nOr what they call a shaved attempted ... since the yellow um in some places it's it's very very skinny right on it I Know back in the day some of them used wired in La Crosse I don't think that's common any longer especially for the older places or margarine to shorten across a lot of interesting and suddenly has a different texture than the stuff which is\nUm comes from the seventies I think the early seventies and it's that's based more of like a civilian Easter pie\nWhich is a two crushed park I'd like to Bali which is how forever yeah All right you know what I'm saying but that is the sauce on top of to cross with all the topics in the middle and also back to the past\nSo and then the mid west or a minister saying is it's not really it's it's mid west from the\nAllegheny Mountains all the way to pass\nAnd again you know if he's still going to thin crust pizza and\nIn St Louis or or you know Milwaukee and a lot of them are very similar to Chicago than you know but for the Chicago thing they're cutting squares party caught 'em sometimes actual cracker crust with no lab running right we do we do live in our cross and uh I think the hallmark of it is\nThere is no puff of do like you would see in our New York or New York politics ... exact it's crossing toppings all the way to the as being\nA nerve or you are you a stuffed guy you uh do you guys you know I gotta I gotta tell you I I Am an rock want to know if we've never talked about this but I grew up in Chicago so no I I used to have\nChicago deep dish experience came from\nA place in Evanston called the spot and who used to go there to eat pizza all the time and that was just that was kind of where it all began for me and so you know when I when I parents moved us to to Phoenix\nI was kind of struggling right you know 'cause that was like there ain't nothing here you know especially in Nineteen Seventy nine it was a different environment came down here about eighty three and of course you know I mentioned I came my way to you\nBut uh you know it it is it is a it's an acquired thing and I think you either do it well are you just shouldn't do it\nThat hearing I'm totally on board with that [laughter] so and you do it well it is that\nThat that wouldn't be the first time that the words Phoenix them struggle yeah [laughter] that is neat yeah there is a common struggle yeah but I digress I'm so when we're thinking about the personalities the psychological profiles\nOf the men and women that come into rock goes and order you know across those jury ... who who defined to me the person who stands\nUp and confidently orders and stuffed pizza here at rock those are the ... they're usually Chicago or somebody who's seen it on the travel channel or something and wants to try and\nFrequently that's the only thing the order\nBecause that's the but then like we have something like this I Am the classic thin crust that's just the the sausage thin crust pizza that's your classics outsider Chicago pizza right there okay if if somebody comes in or it's like a thin sausage would double sausage there's a Ninety percent chance that they hail\nFrom the south side are gone and you're in an era ... outside their right I mean I I grew up I think trust you know getting beat this stuff was a tweet that we would do once in awhile but while once or twice a week maybe three times a week really thin crust pizza\nProvided us outside wow but I'm going to grad school so I'm I'm I'm getting I'm getting notes speaking of notes I'm getting notes subtle notes of federal coming off that mid west are not\nAs expensive as I said oh yeah in fact we get our sizes Roma imports and we have oh love them we're out of the day we opened and or even before Lillian or that we're there was a Sicilian family that owns it and I was like I like your sauces what can you put some more fun [laughter] so they've been letting it for us ever since day one oh\nSo fun we're talking Rocco to graziani as the man who has brought the people what they want so for anyone who hails from the windy city or an beyond a he has built rock goes a little Chicago pizzeria for you and your family or were hanging out here on the patio which I think is one of the coolest places do enjoy great pie\nEspecially this time of the euro system\nAreas when right All right so you run out some things for us to uh to kind of a tease us a little bit and this is a huge jeeze Rocco about that kind of a survey of the rock has little Chicago menu where would you suggest we start our tasting today\nOr I Would start with the award winning chicken weightless that seem to be popular a friend of mine when I open this restaurant or ex cafes her caught a a compatriots um he's like we're going to sell sell chicken wings right and I was like no\nI was about ready to sell my fryer having [laughter] I've worked a fryer for enough years where I never wanted to see what I got he was like dude you got a self have chicken and so I put it on the menu\nI was up for it it was only the wings throw down at the at the er at the corner a festival several years ago you walked away brushing hardware home the first time I'd ever had a rock goes way right I ... I my my family hails from Buffalo New York I was the wings were wings were wait\nOne of my boys is from Buffalo New he likes him say\nOkay we can cry about the Buffalo Bills in our peers but anyway ah what what what is it about these wings their insurance they're not\nThey're only a slight integration away from what they still serving the anger bar they have a you know your Frank's hot sauce or we use margarine instead of butter because I I found it didn't take it taste exactly the same and yet or NAFTA by that much butter\nOr what [laughter] you know what I'm blessed that makes her son's Reagan 'cause I'm using liquid margarine so that we could we could use a hard as we can use it at our hot sticks which we we flatter the wing sauce on bread on our pizza dough and makes the bread sticks out these letters or I saw that\nIn addition to you know that that one to one ratio that they use the anchor bar we put some extra Chilean there are some ground girl a dining hall of fame you know your upbringing almost like a sense of place didn't like be some ... vinegar\nAnd I'm from alfonzo [noise] um but anyway I'm Chris kind of shallow and that wing you've render beautifully\nWell we we run them through the first to to get some of the moisture out that way they took a little of course we're in the fire\nSo beautiful parts of the wings now Wednesday is a big night of the week here at uh\nAny longer and longer it is a big night but not for the reason okay we we did for we did wing Wednesday which was a it maxed out at fifty cents a wing I think uh we started at ten cents away\nAnd we did that for ten could have been I think it was sixteen or Seventeen years and it just got to unwieldy for us yeah or in you know like everybody knows who buys wings these days we are not a cast off anyway they're they're really the most ... the chicken so it's just not something that you need to\nJust you know could don't totally understand ah but the wings rain here at Rocco start you're eating experience here with these you know legit award winning wings are Rocco you nailed beautifully where else are we going\nI Would go I have a delicious plate of my grandma's Marron era and our ... recipes other spaghetti and meatballs\nYou know this was an interesting development for people that have never been rockets before\nI actually looking around the patio there are two people that I Know that have never been to Iraq was before that happened up at their here this might be a surprise to them because obviously pizza\nIs is where the Congress begins well we're going old school pasta as well\nRight totally and and I've WON Awards for our meatballs it's but it's totally my grandmother's recipe although we put a little presented or in their cars I seem to have presented on scraps from slicing present oh and and\nIt it gives it a little more richness to so and yeah we we cook our sauce about three and a half four hours or it's not I don't\nIt's not exactly what everybody's grandma from the east coast in Midwest that but it reminds people a lot of home\nI got his name as a movie guy got to say one of my favorite scenes in one of my favorite movies is the godfather when he's teaching\nMichael how to cook the sauce I don't know if you're a man I didn't write honestly that guy outta slice it out but when you put the ball there is a great scene because it's so authentic and so on it's and it's just like that's how it's made for you know write a lot of it\nAnd you know if you go on Italian Facebook forums and there's countless a throw down fights about a mariners are so you know this this might not be like your grandmother's but it's like my grand\nWhat's your what was grandma's name or Marion or let's just take a moment just take a moment of quiet moment\nOf truth lesser uh to to to\nI'll ask Mary and has a has gone on to glory she'd be like Ninety eight bucks which he has done ... lives out in these myths about something you know I've tried to admit meatballs at home for what reason I have no idea um they're they're\nIt's it's more difficult than you'd probably want to lead on that just another day at the office but it's really tough to let me\nCall it is because if if you don't put enough I'm like kinda filler and vegetables and brought into it you could just have a hockey puck you know or something that's like a a boiled hamburger and which is definitely\nYou're gonna rentals rocket thanks so much for everything you do and it's going to do that I I absolutely love it hurt Stratford film fest dot com you're going to

C. H. two sons news and talk\n[noise]\nHave some losses on the war is Lawrence his show which is a disservice Harlem radios as loud as strong as good and I appreciate your support honestly for evocative saw his is a very big deal with lawyers are some that are listening to the lab mouse on\nOn the Internet to hell with their peers large portion of what we know\nFor sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against judge Kavanaugh and the second thing we know for sure is that there's no way anything we did would satisfy the Democrats are they've always got\nA reason why the goalposts need to be moved nothing we could do would try to spoil them their dog in\nThat's Mitch McConnell and he's right the Democrats are dug in but they are dug into a position that's looking more and more week\nEvery moment that goes by especially after the FBI report came back\nIt officially arrived at the White House last night arrived at the U.S Senate today it is being closely held sealed in a Mason jar no it's actually in a room where as a U.S senator you have to show\nThe proper ID that you've got the background and all that then they allow you win no copies of it there is exactly one copy of it at the White House one copy a Capitol Hill\nAnd they're looking at over and here's the well here's at least as much of an indication as we have\nThat there are Republicans out there who are a little bit squishy when it comes to things conservative\nWell two out of the three undecided Republicans have already well they've looked through much of the report maybe not all of it and they have called the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Ford\nThey've called and thorough and I think as much as we can tell anything from that if they're saying it's Thoreau and that they now have covered to say well the FBI is looked into it Christine forward gave her testimony a week ago on Thursday of last week\nAnd she was very sympathetic but was she convincing Brett Kavanaugh was angry\nAs I think any man would be or woman would be if falsely accused\nAnd he was convincing he'd get back up what he said she could not and now after the FBI has delivered its investigation which the Democrat said oh it can't possibly get done in a week\nCourse these are the same Democrats who are totally confident that the FBI could thoroughly review the six hundred thousand emails on congressman Tony wieners laptops remember all that stuff that came to the former congressman because his wife was one of the key right hand people for Hillary Clinton\nAnd he had all those classified emails on his computer and they said no problem will breeze through those six hundred thousand emails\nThey were done in about three days if you could do that in three days\nThe FBI could certainly double check an investigation of claims by a woman who now says that at the age of Fifteen she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh and all the witnesses she names who are supposedly there that night don't remember it including one of our best friends so if we've got a thorough investigation\nHonest untruthful that what matters is the truth and\nNot ... to political snakes [noise]\nUh and uh I guess those days are those days are gone and those days are behind us\nBranch out and I'm Wondering form line ... ph Tucson news and talk\n... pay well anyone ever go back and do what we do on the show no one will go back and remind you about all of these so called experts on TV who said this would never happen\nThey lasted tromp they said he was talking to big game but would never delivered result she has delivered more results in these last twenty month than any president I can remember period\nMaureen grim show one before on one off are wanting to ph Tucson news and talk\nHey it's Chris plant don't forget my shows on right after two sons morning\nNews a lot for now here's moral Lars Larson on one oh four one K. juicy a\nBigger say go eight six six halo hours to join the conversation oh welcome back Lars Larson Joe well we've\nHeard some of the reaction from some of the Senate leadership\nDid say that they believe that all the Democrats are trying to do now is delay and delay and delay we've also heard that some of those who managed to read the investigation of quick additional background check that was done by the FBI at the request of the Senate Judiciary committee and the president of the United states\nThey've looked at it and said yeah this was thorough\nAnd now at this point the Democrats are trying to come up with some other reason to delay the confirmation or we think Saturday morning by the Senate voting is going to vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court my friend Andy McCarthy joins me now contributing editor at National Review and former federal prosecutor Andy good to have you back on\nWant to get your take on on what's happened the last few days we've had the FBI do the traditional background check and and the those who've read it say the report shows nothing new that would change our impression that was left after last Thursday's a testimony by both judge Kavanaugh and ... for\nWell thanks so much Lars there's nothing surprising about there being nothing new because the allegations were obviously very thin and that's\nSaying a more than they probably deserve so it's not surprising that there wasn't anything to collaborate them and it's not surprising to hear Democrats now complaining about the process rather than talking about the allegations because this has never been about anything other than the light you have forty nine\nDemocrats who do not want to have a fifth\nWell liable conservative vote on the Supreme Court so what this has always been a bad is trying to push this\nBeyond the mid term so that the Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate and can defeat\nA cabin on the numbers the same way the Republicans were able to defeat Merrick Garland on the numbers all the rest of it as just hocus pocus to get to that point and the sad thing is that they didn't care about destroying a guy or in order to pull this off\nAnd in fact I think they vowed that even if he's confirmed they plan to try to impeach him but I I look to the history there's only been one Supreme Court justice ever impeached isn't there\nThat's correct but you know I Am going to write about this\nBut there's all kinds of norms that we've always relied on\nThat are no longer the kind of norms that you can absolutely bank on I mean I Hope that's right and I hope that um that that we maintain that tradition that judges can't be\nA it can't be impeached unless they've engaged in some kind of a misconduct or use their offices abuse simply but\nYou know there's all kinds of norms that we've we've had that are no longer you know you you've had two or three generations of students who have been told that norms are\nBasically instruments of oppression that they that the establishment uses to keep them down and deny their desires and deny their policy solutions and the like and I I I just don't know how much we can rely on them anymore\nI just wonder because I've been explained by audience and I think you'd back me up on this and told me if I'm wrong that if they adapted to an eight member court who would've effect to be effectively made a lot of the tightest decisions for foreign effectively and know it would've neutered the Supreme Court to a large extent\nBut could they get the same effect if they decide to try to introduce articles of impeachment against judge Kavanaugh and and by doing what he's still be able to function as a Supreme Court judge wild that nonsense was going on\nI think he would because he would just put his head down and continue to do his job which is one of the reasons we should want him\nOn the court I also think Lars as a practical matter the chance that Kavanaugh or any other Supreme Court justice is going to be removed is so remote\nOr as to be the ... that's not to say that you know like President Trump if the Democrats got an a majority in the house they couldn't impeach\nA sitting Supreme Court justice but the Senate would never remove them and everybody would understand that this was transparently political and I doubt historically that it would count for much\nUsually Andy I ask you legal questions because your background is a federal prosecutor the guy with the blonde shake in prison for terrorism and Andy by the way is the author of the grand jihad how Islam and the laughter sabotaging America and here's a great example of it but let me ask you a political question\nDo you think that the Democrats by behaving in this way I mean it was actually referred to as a demolition derby today that it was a scorched earth policy that it was you know search and destroy mission was one of the descriptions I think John Cornyn throughout to Senator John Cornyn drought today\nDo you think that Americans average Americans who don't follow this closely as we do are going to look at this kind of behavior and be turned off by it to the point where they might change votes this fall\n[noise] well I think laws if you look at as I understand it if you look at for example the the polling that we're all looking so carefully at\nOf the Senate races where you have these Democrats in red states Democrats in states that Trump won in in some places very decisively or trying to hang on what we're seeing is that\nThere's been a shift in the sense that the party out of power and in this case that the left with Trump in has been very animated and we're told you know very excited about the idea of of voting against\nTrump or sending a message to Trump in the midterms I think having overplay their hand with\nAh with with Kavanaugh what they've done is awake and they usually more than a party in power for the midterms and MIT\nSo I think we're seeing some indication that what you describe exactly is what's going on they people looking at this and that fight you buy it\nWell and that means that did they miscalculated when they first calculated maybe we can take him out with an anonymous charge of the last minute that didn't work so we'll do unnamed to charge where Dr Ford's name has come out Christine Ford\nAnd that didn't work so then we'll throw in a Debbie Ramirez which was even weaker case and then we'll throw in Julie sweating Nick which is by my read a gigantic mess because she's got all kinds of of other baggage she brings with her and then as they did that\nThey started as you say to turn people off and and and both do that turnout Democrats and wake up Republicans and now I guess Heidi Heitkamp is come out and said she's going to vote against Kavanaugh and that might just not you might literally remover in North Dakota which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world because she's given her opponent a real boost\nYeah I think I think all of that is right and I think lawyers it just goes to show what a monumental miscalculation they've made because I think with respect to professor for\nMost people even if they thought that she was long war of the mind at least credit her good faith that you know was sincere or even if she was in ... not not particularly credible and I think by the time you get to sweat neck\nUm it's so preposterous\nPeople now look at it and where they were originally willing to credit people's good faith on the left they now see that this was a campaign as as Kavanaugh says it was it turn this whole\nIdea of advice you can sense it's a search and destroy and they they were willing to destroy this guy's life\nDestroy his family destroy his character over Supreme Court seat and I think people should lightly fight you buy that\nTwenty almost Twenty years after the phrase the politics of personal destruction was used I think it will inappropriately Jeanette ... a real a real creep and Bill Clinton or were you all rape is somebody who really had done terrible things to women\nAnd at that time they said oh you can't engage in the politics of personal destruction I guess unless it it benefits your side and I hope Republicans see all this and say we're never going to behave this way no matter how much it might cost us so we will not do it and I I I for the most part I don't think they will Andy thanks for your insights we always valued them\nWhere you can ask a follow up question the\nQuestion is it time what you don't want to know the location you could ask questions about it we have this kind of what is your age your ally ... you're going to tell it over\nMe Jerry ... I'm trying to be reason I'm going to keep my question short you keep your answer short\nShe was asked Dan where this happened she doesn't know where it happened do you know when it happened or even what year it happened and she's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and send its best aging in and said ask her again you know where this happened or any answer would change\nThe actually she knows more information than that how do you\nKnow ... to the north and she stayed it so we we're pretty close we actually there are questions are getting where exactly what time of please give us happened what time of year and the Republicans cut short that questioning by that he left us shouldn't they brought in the Republicans\nCouldn't even hold on hold on a jury Harry hey I don't like it\nWhen you miss the facts the Republicans got five minutes at a time and they turn their time over to the professional sex crimes investigator for the Democrats each each of the questions on the panel got five minutes at a time they got exactly the same amount of time uh I ... and one of them spend all his time asking about sports\nAnd and about uh about what slang was in high school or you know and what devil's triangle was which turns out to be a drinking game just as he said so when you say the Democrats didn't have time to ask her word happen\nShe's been very clear and all the things you said in her letter to find signs in her testimony under oath to the Senate committee she doesn't know where it happened in jury you realize how ridiculous is is to say if only the FBI had asked that question four or five more times her answer might have changed\nLet's go to another ... nana\nThat's what we call my wife when the grandbabies around now welcome to the

the thing is\nHe's a liar liar by ... what did he lie about he is he is the little um thing where he ... jobs around the questioning doesn't answer it\nActually did answer that question I went back

it's like he will be nervous you know why did\nHe ... he hasn't been in politics she's been on the bench as a judge and it it operates a whole different way than what that hearing to the other day and

communicating with buyers text messages to joined ABC's Rebecca Jarvis her podcast no limit to discuss the business and how she and her business partner Gen climate\nOf help lift up other female entrepreneur\nIn addition to the business is that you created this foundation project entrepreneur where you're helping other women are worse did you go into the company thinking eventually we want to also have this other arm and how did you build out that other arm when you were so focused on building a business at the same time\nYeah oh great question at such a privilege to not only belt rent the runway but the rent the runway foundation and\nOur first program their project entrepreneur is a combination of summits with action oriented workshops and then an incubator and um you know when I started around the runway and we didn't have this like yes there will be the rent the runway foundation a plan and that\nThat but we did both share a passion for empowering women and I think in our first couple of years we've really took advantage of and saw how our network and so many entrepreneurs who were generous with their time\nWas critical and helping out under any and so what we we felt very lucky and grateful to have that\nI think we ought to gradually start to see it the business group that female empowerment was part of the rent rent my brand\nAnd it was in part because down in my story became tied to what rent the runway as and have you know we were women going after our big vision and dream in the community felt that kind of energy as well and many of our consumers are power businesswoman and they're using our dresses do kind of take on the next kind of career move in their life and\nUm I think wearing a great out that makes you feel confident and empowered so it was very authentic and treat it will be where um you know why we decided to start a bit and start it in the throes of still running you know rent the runway at the time and now writing and other businesses because those\nWere who we learned the most from ourselves so we found the most value from other entrepreneurs who were still in the mix of the day to day\nThere were maybe a couple of years that had a bad but they always kind of whether it was and they knew what the price per square foot of an office space was or what health care provider we should talk to you or just you know extending leveraging their networks they they had that real hands on skills that that\nWas valuable to us on and so we believe that we could offer that through an incubator program in a really unique way\nTo women and wanted to pay that foreign\nAnd to your point there is so much about being an entrepreneur that isn't the business itself I mean the health care provider where you located because those are things that most people would think of it like fundamental to the business idea but if you get those wrong yeah they don't have the business\nThat all of that you know infrastructure type that can just pick up a lot of time especially in the first year that the place where with Wal Mart relationship I've been really grateful to get just this running start but you're ... you know so many pieces of starting a business and building a team while you're off to solving a consumer problem when you're an entrepreneur and um you know we try to gifts\nSo many pieces of starting a business and building a team while you're off to solving a consumer problem when you're an entrepreneur and\nUm you know we try to get females both those access to the kind of that infrastructure answers and I'm kind of perspective but also resources on data\nAnalytics product engineering how'd you were crude how do you hire 'em and what we kind of thing as you know each entrepreneur who enters its fairly early stage but they still have different challenges and goals that they're\nAddressing in this program so we try to think like how can we get each of them to that next stage in their career and I was hired the biggest thing we see across entrepreneur ours is they're often not thinking are dreaming big enough\nNow where I think we're able to add the most value and and a goal to Jen and I feel passionately about is\nPushing them to think you know it we have one company that's I'm bringing dental care and dental hygiene two officers right so this trend of people are in their office more working more like flu shot comforter off if I Can't dental hygiene come and say\nOkay we'll like a dentist comes jobs for the appointment yeah well for the whole office rights even Booker slot now they're they're in your office and it during the work every six months to a dentist shows up right thing and so we're like well doesn't just have to be done to us like could be doctors ... you know like what other services could it be that are coming to the workplace and kind of making more efficient use of\nThe employees time because he didn't have to leave the office of federal\nBut also the employer yet that advantage of like it's it's they're they ... do you play didn't have to leave for two hours for the appointment so just like stretching to have to think about could it be bigger can think of other industries as well what's one thing you learned the hard way it read the runway that you're now applying it jet black\n[noise] gosh [noise] um I mean I think I learned the hard way round the runway you know\nBeing hands on with technology as much as possible so I Am not an engineer is you're not have a technology background and one of the early mistakes Jen and I made was\nWe found affirmed rebelled at our website and read the runway and completely just handed off their requirements documents when we worked really hard on all the details and what we thought it needed to look like\nAnd um then we're like okay now they're going to go about it and they're going to just end up over a website and a couple of months\nAnd it doesn't work like that right and um I think we we learned that the hard way for sure I read the runway website back we didn't look the way you wanted it got the website back was the problem right so we didn't it didn't come back and then we waited another week or two and I wound up flying to Canada where this theoretical team of seven engineers is working on the side of like one person\nComing in at noon and there was like wow anything so I had
