going to be in West Virginia idea what's up\n[noise] yeah I'm On a are you I'm living the dream what's happening\nI can I ask you a personal question\nAbsolutely I was hoping you would yes\nAre you in shape them clothing\nUh I'm not a sheep it all in pretty much a wolf you you see what you get what you see is what you get my ...\nMaking sure that means you're a conservative on like on the side but you're leaning towards the Democrats air air so I took a chance with Joe when used like this statement when you made this statement President Trump is like a bull in a China shop\nRight ... years yeah\n... ... as a boy and a China shop there Joe interested in race everything right it destroys the ... it just it destroys politics\nAs usual listen I realized that you've got a little sheep seniors in your in your face or somebody on one with the sheep whole thing was here's here's what's real and I hear you I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna let you speaking I'm gonna let you speak it a second let me tell you what my metaphor was about the politics as usual the China shop was completely\nUnaware of Obama's presence because he made sure it's the pristine\nHe would not step on political toes while he was screwing up the country well he was making us look like idiots around the world well he was alone as Americans to die in Benghazi and was fast and furious guns this guy made race relations horrible\nBut the China shop was fine he would not have messed up the political China shop even a little bit Trump walks in exist screw you all watch this\nAnd he destroyed politics as usual the left he didn't take it\nBut the the even the moderates to take it I like what he's doing I think in being a mechanic shop is a good thing because he doesn't sit back and his laurels and just let the world happen so he looks good he doesn't care if he looks bad as long as he's doing well for the American people now I'll shut up you understand what I meant when I was going to have to say that\n\nSo why don't just say what's your name Joe\nWell I said that day and you weren't listening very well you look some boozer sheep's years down the writers\nNo they were talking about a year I heard it from not proud of the games I get it every day oh I didn't like that why don't people saying what they may\nI did I said the same thing a little while ago you just didn't understand that so I clarified\nOkay Joe anyway I Want to give you my opinion I'm a military man I sort of Twenty one years in the on three sheets that\nLake front lawn sign could go from the age of seven came up in jail\nOr just hit on forty ... anyway I studied uh Germany when Germany won't bore now like Hitler get it all by ourselves way early and then twenty starting in the ... I think\nThey I don't know who they are I think now what they call themselves secrets society and let the group\nAnd I believe the Democrats are scared the hell out of wherever they are\nAnd the way they come across like Nancy Pelosi and its waters and all that [noise] I don't think in the Democrat Party instead of being a liberal party is scared to death of somebody\nIn line vice to you every American League it's where the cost to patients understand the constitution and you're a fan what our president is doing\nAll right thanks I appreciate you\nNine four one ... non for one Seventy four seven just to make sure I understood he was asking me a personal question in my both in sheep's clothing um I usually the best I could and then he tried to tell me how horrible it was that I said the president's bowling a China shop he didn't understand the metaphor that when I was saying was\nYou had Obama who was squeaky clean looking and made you feel good was all presidential and he sucked and now you're going to guy doesn't care comes in Knox things around and is doing right by the American people what did you say that well that's exactly what I said I made the comparison right here but I Do love you and I appreciate you\nAnd look out for those people over in Germany than a better controlling everybody let me say hello and welcome to a Peter who is in Pennsylvania but you know what's going on high\nA happy fixing the Tuesday\nOr a semi taco Tuesday but either way good\nOkay uh you know I Am certainly convinced a because they really don't know what to make of him Donald Trump could cure aids and the left would still hate him how\nI mean when you consider all the misdeeds of the Obama administration and\nLike I said to the girl to pick up the phone [noise] Hitler it must be made of Kevlar because charges don't stick to her that would ordinarily stick to someone like you or someone like me and it's horrible\nAnd she ... you're you're spot on on your analogy as far as the China shop and\nI don't think you dialed again understood it or didn't like it or something I don't know\nWell I mean the simple truth is is not a presidential he tells it like it is ... and ... you know what a lot of people feel better if it wasn't on Twitter that's what I like about him\nBecause he just flat out says this is you know he let you know and to many of these liberals dance around things\nAh and this guy's keeping his promises and on top of that uh you know four or eight years of Obama my insurance up a hundred and thirty two percent or ... or ... and everything else I feel a lot better with this man in here\nBecause I feel like\nWe're we're going to get it we're going to get it straight and he do remember a ... of the you I think it was he was at a un some type of un summit a pushed one of those leaders out of the way hey Americans here baby we are back on the\nInternational Louisiana law he was playing around or not but I Would I really like is when he was at breakfast at one morning and unless you're like about the butter the bagel and it looks at the guy says yeah you've been screwed my country and I'm done with that we're not going\nTo happen to be more no no we got to change it it's not right you know that it's not right I mean ... ... a guy the guy doesn't care about decorum doesn't care about political and you know that\nMakes you wince a little bit but at the same time he's doing what's right for you and me\nAnd for the American people and I can't argue with them\nI Can't argue abusive to remember that he sat down at breakfast and he said you're by you're helping to finances Russian oil my line you're buying oil from Russia was not your friend and here we are protecting your for all this money that's not right is that right that's not right now and the legacy media tried to light 'em up over it\nThey try to protect you were doing something bad when in fact he was saying we're protecting you were looking out for you why exactly would you go and give somebody else the benefit when that other person or that other entity could in fact be the bad guy\nAre that the economy of this country when crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the stock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nThat some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K.\nYou know where every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases believe me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nIs Eric Trump is sort of president Donald Trump also trumpeter national it was interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people got those or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding\nEmployees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone base last employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada said no way we're going to do it then they made a deal Mexico said no way we're gonna do it but they made a deal do you use it in a way we're going to do with them they made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the Bakken how weird is that\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare rotating Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world ... keep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know flew through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug um\nLegislation that road has drastically reduce the\n... you look at a right to try to look at so many of these different efforts and\nYou know that's right because you know the politicians have been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives and then they don't care about actually governing they just want to keep themselves elected so their sales people that's not who he is I mean he's he's the one guy who's probably ever come into government who had the worst of life you know then then\nBefore he ... and there's usually I I\nThink he needed this job I go home and had he had the greatest life in the world he you know what I mean he was paid me the American dream and maybe still isn't so many ways\nHe didn't need the headache he didn't need the aggravation but he would open up the papers every single day and you'd see\nAmerica give us a hundred and fifty billion dollars to Iran a country that absolutely hate our guts right you know instead of spending it on a\nYou know our inner cities or educational systems or our military right that had fighter jets where they were going to museums to borrow parts because they didn't have enough parts for our our ... I mean it's crazy this is this is ... or giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars to a country that would love to see is wiped off the face of the earth\nAnd I see him shaking his head jail at seem shaking his head saying well what are we doing as a nation are these people absolutely\nInsane and they were and look how much he's accomplished in two years I mean look what he's accomplished a two year period of time it's unbelievable\nIt's or is there a drop drop international also of course the president or president Donald Trump\nOr in watching the germs approach it didn't look great for Republicans in fact it looked like the house is going to be easy win for the so called blue wave and the Senate was ... was was right on the border now it looks like we'll probably game three or four senators provided people do and vote and the house was up for grabs again\nI think that's got to be with Kavanaugh effect you've got to be but we were re motivated re energized on the right in traditional American values people by watching the lengths to deliver would go to do you think that can last two or three weeks or are we still okay there we have to keep on energizing people\nWell and you always have to energize people and people have to realize how important their vote is you have to get out you know if you believe in ... you have to get out you have though I mean it's just that simple even if he's not in the valley you have to get\nOut how to use about him though isn't it hurt it really ...\nIt of course it is of course it is because he doesn't have sent if he doesn't have the house it makes a lot tougher to get you know various things through and you know\nThe cabinet and look at it you know ... I mean whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty arrived at ... the Democrats we like it to me the exact opposite way only because it worked for them that specific day they want somebody be guilty until proven innocent I mean they tried to destroy somebody's family but it but aside from\nYou know the allegations aside from you know from from that side of the things I mean look at that first day in a cabinet got in there and nine thirty in the morning the first day he was set to testify you know on on on Capitol Hill America was tuned into TV they want to hear from you know ... you know potentially the next Supreme Court justice\nHe didn't get to say his first words until three thirty in the afternoon and gives you an Cory Booker Spartacus and all these people out there to grandstanding they were running for president from\nYou know from the stage it was unbelievable that's not what America is that's not what the confirmation process is of a Supreme Court justice you know we deserve so much better than this than than this nonsense and\nIn a way to get everything that my father um fights against I mean the the swamp these deep um it's so much deeper than I ever thought it was and\nYou know there are lashing out they're losing a lashing out a the Democrats don't stand for anything any more um other than you know the elimination of plastic straws and doubling your taxes which would put our country into a a\nYou know would put their country and to the second Great Depression um but they don't have a message they don't have any leadership and and and and we're winning I went into it were winning America's winning\nAmerican economy really evident in the past few weeks the your rights their platform is anything other than Trump and it's not going to work it's not resident gives gives Eric Trump or your diagnosis\nIn Houston next Monday which is going to be a great event\nI think ten thousand people will be there is no more standing outside I'm gonna try to get down there to uh let me ask you this though the criticism on the left and it's been criticism for two and a half three years now is that ... and and your father didn't like each other in the campaign trail but they're really not only are they very ... but the sound of the really similar guys\nWhen it comes to making promises and keeping them rise\nAnd this and has been great advocate of or a a my father in Washington and um you know I think I think that relationship I think the friendship has um as as as quite frankly really developed um pretty significantly\nYou know when when you come in and I remember my father was a you know a big risk that guy he didn't he didn't know any of these people you never rubbed shoulders with these people never spoke to them a cocktail parties I mean he was a he was an outsider and\nYou know a lot of times it takes it takes a while to get to know somebody and then you realize that you're you're fighting for the exact same thing and you know ... very very hard for so many things in my father's fought for and um he's been a big help and the mission to you know not to sound cheesy but make America great again which ... he's been doing them and whether\nIt be the tax reform whether it be cabinet or whether it be you know a hundred other things you know passing a massive amounts of of of of legislation take not so many issues that are so important I mean he's been a tremendous help and um I Know him personally and I've had personally and um you know and it was family and those two beautiful little daughter is a you know I Know his wife and um they're\nGood people um they're really good people hey do do do elections get contentious of course they do but they're good people and we uh we we need we need head we want people ... people have to get out people have to vote it's just a it's critically important\nIt's Eric ... you're going to ask you very quickly about too quick hits and well we will not spend much time on this but we kinda left before before we went on today I'm over the past two days Elizabeth Warren has been not not only not vindicated she's been proven to be completely long about our heritage and in fact the Cherokee Nation has asked her to be quiet now\nAnd then today because you're dead woman's lawsuit that that this was definitely Clifford in her her slimy\nA lawyer we're bringing today he called her horse race or something on Twitter when you're dead do stuff like that do you ever cringe a little bit or does it make you laugh at me what what what are you\nHe clearly won over over both Clifford and over ... I mean he's the winner in those little bottles that were off to the side when you see that going down what do you say because I mean it's blown up social media which blew my crazy\nYeah it is I mean I I'm I'm working as a media literally as we speak their picture of a duck and it says um you know it's obviously a parody of of of Elizabeth Warren but that's one ten twenty fourth bald eagle one\nOne thousand and twenty fourth and bald eagles on the phone funny little me most of us that that's the whole\nConversation today and it really is America elected a fighter ride aid and he's not one of

Nation came out a large it\nBut you know he's a counter punch your rights and and and and he's a fighter he is is that sometimes to his detriment probably but I don't know how you change somebody's

I've got no time at all and and I'm I'm going to give it to you but I've got like forty five seconds before the break and you make an Avon\nI can tell I'm a ... thing I'll tell you this right off the bat a number one a Trump\nWas the guy that nobody expected to win right hand or are we all expected to lose but he came through and he was the businessman that nobody expected because he was not a politician who is a businessman\nTo I Want to make a little shout out to my uh my my uh veterans friends\nI'm a veteran a Cold War veteran of the twenty six Yankee Infantry Division one twenty six signal battalion night and number three quickly\nIn this country is more Native American middle is with Warren turns out to be her so called vindication wasn't it actually made a fool out of herself\nIs that ... again don't live there is a big deal in Massachusetts right now is the media going nuts over this are they trying to help her out over this is this something that you'll talk about the debate coming up\nWell we hadn't talked about it during the entire campaign because to be honest with ya what her family said and what she believes is one thing right like the fact that she did take to minority hiring positions one at University of Pennsylvania and one at Harvard and she was the one who actually listed yourself as Native American international\nDirectory or that basically said that she was a ... a directory this for lawyers that college is that when a higher and look at you know\nWhen she got to University of Pennsylvania she insisted she made it a listed\nAs Native American but when she got to Harvard and got that job she delis yourself from that national directory as Native American so clearly when she was done using that it was a you know out in Port and do anymore and she never went to any Native American events on campus\nOr the fact is she never apologize for that the issue has been bothering people for a long time but he's the one who ended up yesterday opening Pandora's box and talking about it\nAnd I'm with you this was going to go away I mean the president calling her Pocahontas makes it look like ... she's a victim she complained about card the fact that she did a DNA test\nAnd put the results out there that proves that you and I are more Native American and she is and I'm not at all or ... that just doesn't make any sense she actually she look through your softball or through the president of softball or do you think that she really thought going in because she's not stupid do you think that she thought going into this was going to be\n... the victory for whoever Trump and possibly that get thrown the national stage to be the nominee of twenty twenty\nWhat is it a couple of things going I think she knew she had to try to put the issue aside somehow if she's going to let me say twenty twenty and\nAnd during the Kavanaugh hearings she was so desperate to make the national scene that she\nDocumented video and did a fundraising letter off of that she also did another fundraising letter off the uncorroborated or testimony of Dr Ford\nAll of this basically to try to make her name out in the national headlines at a time when she's competing with Kamala Harris and of course a center of Spartacus yeah I mean that's what the oil is for her to try to beat the far left progressive nominee for\nA two thousand and twenty and again in Massachusetts I\nFirst of all she has missed leading us for a long time you know she was on meet the press saying that she has no intention of running for president Joan yet said that many times and then all of a sudden she says I'm going to take a hard look at it we found out with ...\nLast weekend that basically she's been spending a lot of money half a million dollars on candidates\nAround the country raising over seven million dollars for candidates like she's of course been to Ohio recently of stumped for their candidate for governor ... in Pennsylvania in Oklahoma a few weekends ago while I was up in Lawrence dealing with people with the gas line explosions here in our state so she's been spending a considerable amount of time\nUh basically working on that presidential run and now I think people in Massachusetts are fully aware she has no intention of working for them show or spend the next two years if she's reelected traveling around the country a delivery nothing for us\nWhich is actually also admitted that she she would not commit to uh to to living on her term if he wins again she sort of I I Can't promise that all state senator for the next six years which is something that you will promise right\nRight exactly you know Massachusetts has some issues whether it's health care the fishing industry the opioid crisis\nAnd things I've been working on things I Know I can continue to work on a whereas she's been MIA and I think I'm right now it's really interesting there's a move afoot in the state to try to get Deval Patrick ... he's the former governor of Massachusetts has become a candidate\nFor a running and twenty twenty so it's interesting even the Democrats in Massachusetts seem to be trying to crowd her out of this field because I think it's clear at this point\nShe really can't avoid stepping in it anytime she is on the national stage whether it's calling law enforcement in criminal justice system racist whether it's saying that anybody who voted for Trump is part of a stew of racist I mean she really just has that same negative tone that Hillary Clinton had as well\nYeah I agree totally it's Jeff deal he's a Republican running against a Elizabeth Warren ... percent of you know in Massachusetts but you run a ... and that's a it's a pretty good place to go because\nThe Republicans were looking like it might be a bad November of ... the blue wave whatever that is as you mentioned ... but anyway uh the blue wave allegedly was gonna give them a house back the Senate was going to be very close might even give him the Senate now it looks like\nThey might gain three or four seats including you um ... comment on even those who were center center center left to live in Massachusetts did not like with the left just dude you're not hearing are you finding that to be the case are you feeling this the impact of Kavanaugh on on your ... to see or know\nYeah there's a lot of people in Massachusetts that feel that he was railroaded I'm the father of two daughters so of course I'd want them to be listening to if something happened but the fact is there was no corroborated evidence with a a basically an eleventh hour smear attempt a Dianne Feinstein her the senator the ranking member of the judiciary could have\nHad that uh those allegations investigated in private six weeks earlier she didn't she chose to drop it like a bombshell too embarrassed if a man and she ended up ruining two lives um the accuser any accused\nAnd then the process made the Senate look increasingly bad and I think that people are so sick and tired of Washington looking dysfunctional and they know that Warren is basically the tip of that dysfunctional spear um again because she takes such awful actions about going out there and basically saying presumption of innocence the cornerstone of our democracy that means nothing if you want to just\nMake sure that Republicans don't get their nominee for the Supreme Court or that partisanship doesn't work even in Massachusetts and I I'll say this Joe\nYou know we are the state where Ted Kennedy used to hold the same seat and even though he was the liberal lion of the Senate it would work with Republican presidents and Republican governors to deliver for our state people are sick and tired of war and not delivering and then becoming a national embarrassment as well\nI Wonder if Massachusetts is ready for somebody who's not for overwhelming regulation overwhelming grace of of government overwhelming taxation because to me when I figured Elizabeth Warren other than the Pocahontas stuff\nThe thing that comes to mind is she's basically your socialist she's basically far leftists that says if we control everything we're smart people they knew people will have a better life I don't want her to control me who does that really what it is it's sort of be the guy who believes\nTo believe that she's the smartest person in the room\n[laughter] well look I'm an Eagle Scout I always thought you'd have to anybody campground better than you found it I ran for office at the age of forty and now that the running for the Senate never thought I'd be doing this but it's something I think is calling it's not supposed to be a career and I'll tell you with Elizabeth Warren wanted the\nWar and wanting to nationalize business having government determine what your board of directors composition should be you know that's one step towards Venezuela and look at what's going on right there she wants health care to be run by government and\nIf you know if you like having a you know dialysis six months after you need it\nAt like England has sure go to that socialist healthcare where he like having hip replacements after five years\nGo to Canada but if you like having the United states where we actually get procedures done in a timely manner\nYou know we shouldn't have government running our health care\nAnd so you know one cannot have government run our lives enough in fact she wants to access to the point where uh I think on CNBC she said fifty percent would be the starting point up too and we don't know that feeling I guess the the host said Ninety percent might be too much and she agreed somewhere between fifty percent Ninety percent I think she would actually take a year income Joe\nI just doesn't make any sense artist Jeff deal he's a Republican running for US Senate against Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts I Wish it nothing but the best of them you've got to a debate coming on friday night or your kicks maps\nAnd that and let's talk again before the midterm I I I really hope to see that she turn red for the people of Massachusetts more importantly than a numbers game for me I just think that the people in Massachusetts are

I'll tell you I'll tell you Laura New Jersey people are smart and and they you know they recognize how poorly served\nBut the bigger issue really are are twofold one is affordability ... New Jersey economy is being dragged along by a very strong national economy people were underperforming and the people in Jersey or most highly tax people in the country property taxes are outrageous\nIncome taxes sales taxes corporate business tax\nEvery tax the top of the heap and\nIt we were losing families a senior citizens are leaving we have the fastest way about migration of Eighteen to thirty four year olds because it's so wonderful article for young people to live here so affordability is by far and away the number one issue secondly is the fact that\nUh you know Washington has failed them were fifty fifty with a ... we get we get respect from Washington than any state in the country and people say it's time for change your dirty deserve to be treated better\nWell the the state level of taxation isn't determined by a U.S senator correct\nYes but I have to tell you Laura leaders lead leaders go with the problems are in one Washington has failed New Jersey when we're fifty out of fifty so poorly served every anything we get back is better for Washington has got to help you for the ability of New Jersey\nAnd give it but also you know there's only three three jobs in New Jersey that every citizen gets a vote on the two senators and the governor I'm going to shine the light of day on every issue that matters to people in Jersey with us missile issue counties state or federal issue ... leaders go to solve\nPeople's problems not just say somebody else's problem somebody else go take care of it we've got too much leadership failure New Jersey it's time for leaders to leader\nHey Bob listen uh Menendez hitting the trail with Hillary recently wasn't that happening\n[laughter] yeah I I was surprised she came I don't know how much the way he has let race has been pretty ah neither that's why a\nSchubert his crowd is how to put I think I think it was like seven and a half million of outside Washington money against we already in this race\nOr she was apparently in New Jersey on one day I'm surprised that she'd want his baggage with all the the the L I you know ... or ... why would what his baggage if all the stuff she's put up with her life about sexual misconduct\nYeah I mean I Do think that a ... piece today and the national review sleazy Bob Menendez\nIs thinking New Jersey campaign and basically saying the Democrats effort to save him may end up torpedo knowing their chances are retaking\nAnd and basically saying the Democrats effort to save him may end up torpedo knowing their chances of retaking the Senate and Michelle\nOutlines all the various problems with Menendez ethical problems of course not flying as Michel says the cronies guys on multiple luxury flights to the Caribbean with a wealthy donor pal Salman ...

just just to\n... explain what Bob was saying and further detail about what Menendez did with these ... these visas okay a gate and Michelle calls at ... thirty six a double ... visa program again doubled the cup\nMenendez and his staff pressured the state department to expedite the foreign tourists in student visa approval process these for a bevy of buck some foreign beauties\nAnd she ... a previously had reported on this one of them Brazilian actress and porn pent up star Giuliano Lopez AKA girlfriend number one had her F. one student visa application moved to the top of the pile in two

I Wonder exactly um what people are thinking about the the Lone Star state because I think that people have a certain image of who we are as as Texans and I think a lot of people are surprised that a guy like old war two was so far left and so far socialist is even in the ... okay did you hear that that he has been telling people that his mother was a lifelong Republican\nYeah I heard something about that earlier today yeah Beto\nO'Rourke has said his mother was a lifelong Republican who for the first time in her life will vote for a Democrat because he's running\nMhm yeah I mean that's a hard to research is it\n\nJust was mumbled it for ... to just come out there I guess I'm just wondering you know\nMa'am and then or ...\nOr is this is a works mother a lifelong Republican\n... voted for him\nNo I mean for for president in two thousand eighty that you voted for um\nProbably Obama\nKnow that you wait a second bad though says that she's only voted Democrat or I was only voted Republican her whole life and will now switch to vote Democrat just costs her son's running mhm so clearly to president who she voted for\nWell then I guess you have to know Republicans send them from McCain\nAide we're right the first the Muslim or non rug\nObama be forget I mean seriously that we really we do we really have to fact check his what he says about his own mother at least we argue against them I don't want to I Want to take him at his word but it turns out he's full of it so yeah I mean it's been reported by the blaze but in fact uh works mother voted for Barack Obama\nThat wasn't the funniest part of the answer because 'cause cruise actually said this last night the after partying it got a really big rousing laugh out of the crowd he was talking about the blind squirrel I'm\nMegan is wide yeah bad though you said that his daughter was is there something back to health applied score yeah go ahead\nWhat oh blind squirrel isn't that just isn't much of a joke you know not every once in a while I was like it was behind that was like a gimmick\nThing no last night that yes this really did happen and it's it's out there on the Internet somewhere I don't I don't have it we don't have video of it but there is video that somebody took and they posted it the first thing I said my name is Joe ... Joe ... but you can Kobe toe and that that's it [laughter] the crowd was I had him in the\nBottom of my ... had to do something that and and and I won't elaborate much but Ted Cruz didn't make reference to a ... stone last night in your party uh-huh okay\nSalem I'd ... I'd Lardy blood on the stove or somebody who's lived with his army definitely did he went there All right so let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on their side again many people watch those who can't vote for either one they don't live in the state or this was the top trained on Twitter for four hours straight\nAnd and it happened organically it wasn't it wasn't sponsored it wasn't promoted I'm and I'm interested in hearing what you say let me let me start in Texas however here's David Hi David what's going on\n[noise] Hey Joe thanks for taking my call ... so that you are real quick or you know the problem now is like at the at the last election you know I was a ... got a hallway\nAnd hindsight [laughter] you know and we're glad he didn't get the nomination 'cause I don't think he would've beat her\nI was a cruise got away and hindsight [laughter] you know and we're glad he didn't get the nomination 'cause I don't think he would have the her\nWithout the groundswell of the Donald Trump or you know totally had I mean he he pulled out people that close but not a cold out so in hindsight it was a good thing he didn't win the nomination now I think he has said that they get a lot of enemy\nWas the guy a lot of guys are going for that real conservative so I think he has a ... a good shot down Trump get does get a second term that are the better thing really aggravates me that guy you know I like to drink a beer with him one day just to get the\nToken ribs or something [laughter] I just a liar he just\nHe is he's misrepresenting who he is he he and he's told many many you know are just fall foods during this campaign if you've been listening to my show for a while you know David that I was a cruise guy from the beginning to\nAnd I'm ... and I did want to cruise to get the nomination once it was clear that he wasn't going to a hundred percent was going to support whoever the next person was going to be and that person became Donald Trump um I was never against Donald Trump candidates the I thought it was actually pretty cool but somebody who was not in politics could could do so well\nAnd it was close man I mean Ted did very very well I mean think about it he was second place it's almost got the nomination but I agree with your your assessment I think that you needed Donald Trump to beat Hillary Clinton needed somebody who is going to fight going to roll it sleeves up and not\nCare whatsoever about what the establishment or the or the historic worthy\nUm traditional politic a politician looked like he wanted to come in and say whatever you had to say to win whatever liberal jihad he would mix\nAnd and I think you're right he's the right guy at the right time it does crews have a chance in in in ah twenty twenty four I think he does other you certainly right up there\nI I Hope he makes it in one last thing like you know at all I got from it and it got or or whether he says yeah better than real popular aims to get\nPeople on the border he's from the border town and he says you know he's just using that in the ... right you know it's real and you you said Robert scientists I think we are in that name often I get a kick out of your taco an adult and the cash ... say [laughter]\nI'll just say one thing I I don't know when\nI go that's what I'm saying now that was good that was good I better be away so so here's the thing with um with O'Rourke\nShe wrote that ... you can correct me if I'm wrong if I ever speak out a term when it comes to an actual news item in actual fact\nCorrect me if I'm wrong they're going to court my opinion not to be a different thing but you can as well as you were good friends but when ... wrote that that a review of the play when he was in high school right after high school whatever it was a late teenagers Seventeen or Eighteen years old\nHe wrote it and when he objectify women talking about their butts talking about their boobs\nOne name that he uses a byline\nWas it Robert Francis I don't remember it was Robert O'Rourke okay he wrote it as Robert ...\nLet me ask you something if your name is so Beto back though if that's your name and that's the name you go by at forty something years old because you've only always been known as that name\nAnd if it's such a your name but it needs to be on the ballot when you run for election something is official as wanting to be a U.S senator why wasn't it your name when you wrote some stupid article when you're in high school college\nIt's a good question I don't know\nI think it's a valid question and I I Would like for somebody to ask him that question when did you become ... full time when did that happen\nHe's always been known as the look here's a picture of they're wearing a sweater with his\nBeta fulltime when did that happen\nNo he's always been known as the look here's a picture of him wearing a sweater what's his name on the front side of a sweater which I've never seen before ever I mean seriously ... Gary you and I've talked about this I was a\nDumb into the picture yeah but but even I didn't have my neighbor's front of my shirt [laughter] okay I didn't know that Adam that may be on the back need maybe a new born shirt maybe on a Jersey but as your last name in the back of your shirt or anything right right\nOkay\nHey Casey forgets his name or in case the teacher forgets what to call and let me write this on the front of the shirt man yeah yeah I got edited nine for one pack Joe ... dot com back out to Minnesota see what's going on high\nWell hey there they love the show every day for all that you are a lot of snow this man I was just wondering if there's any possibility that they could get fact checkers on these debates it seems like if they had a panel for people or something setting off on the side and when\nUh the people debating say no no no that's all wrong with that for a fact checkers could go and\nLook up about the truth as and popping up on the side of our TV screen so we don't have to wait for the next day four papers that come out and in fact check everything and then people don't see it because they don't read the paper or read the news every day or hear the news\nI think it's actually a great idea I mean here's a great idea I just don't know I mean as fast as the Internet I guess you could get you you could get some sort of a fact checking going during the debate but would it take away from what they're actually saying and and do the moderators do it or do you have people like ... like they had\nA uh Internet bank last night of a bunch of people sitting there actually taking suggestions from the Internet in question for the Internet so I guess you could fact check it that fast\nI mean but then what do you do the moderator finds out that a worker Cruz just said something wrong didn't invent circle back and say we just that are fact checking it turns out you did vote that way or or what are you saying that that uh well uh I don't know\nMaybe it would be interesting I think the debate would have to be longer don't ya\nYeah the yeah I suppose they'd have to get more time that's why at first I was thinking that they just pop it up on the side of the screen that no this is actually what it is and then let them face the consequences the next day and have that be in the newspaper instead of instead of them fact checking out the next day and then people don't see it anyway\nSo instead of making it apart and we had a little debate where the moderators would then go back to what you just put it up on the side of the screen or in the bottom of the screen saying a ... vote was this way or crews did say that\nThat was one thought that I had I thought yeah though to say what happened they'd have to talk about it\nWell I I don't I don't know that and I appreciate you thank you I don't think that they would agree to it I didn't cruise probably would agree with every two or three days by reading that he's ever said and done um\nBut but when it comes to work I don't see in the green to talk about you know to to accepting a fact checking that his mother didn't vote that way in fact\nAccepting the fact checking that in fact he did vote that way in the barrel of oil fact checking like when he says look we don't need a wall look at all Paso I mean the fact checkers say a there is a wall or offense in El Paso so yeah I mean I think that it would be cool I Would do would you be open to that carry\nI think I I think that's very interesting and as far as you know now that the voting in the in the oil and then ten dollar taxi wanted and Ted Cruz said no oh it's getting on my website it would've been really nice to spend money and they were fact checking during the debate and before the debate was over\nGoing back to work and saying hey we did our homework now what might be happy to say because apparently right in that way I Would really like her that answer from him\nWell the weird thing is why would\nExactly right in that way I Would really like her that answer from him\nWell the weird thing is why would he used that as the example of calling Ted Cruz a liar win a war can self knows the way he voted\nFor now I now have rattled by God and I think that listen I think\nThat he was he was advised by the whatever the hell it is that's a ... um call him a liar at some point bring apply in Ted that the president said oh by the way also I Wonder if those across the nation today really believe or work when he says I Can't wait to work with the president on this that and the other\nHere's a guy that has promised to impeach the president should he become elected to US Senate\nWhat he wants to work with the president and he's using the president's words against Ted Cruz\nVery odd to me all these years very strange editing nine four one package Joe packs dot com let's expanded a symbol take calls on this to let's expand it how would you make the debate system better I mean obviously we're better than to guy standing on the stump in a park okay that's so we've been improved their um", "station": "KQTH", "city": "Tucson"}
