used to be one of those people you have a security guard you hire a security guard or you hire a bodyguard that is either trained in hand to hand combat and or both and they carry a firearm I Would just rather be the one that's trained\nBoth so I don't have to expend yeah like a you know taken that cost of expenses that are unforeseen and I needed right I Know how to back I carry firearms and I'm happy about it and so she can continue to use someone who's going to follow her around on her journey wherever she goes everyday who's carrying a gun\nI don't know how then you're not okay with gun\nRight no I was telling you and me that we we shouldn't be able to do the same thing\nYeah and and my question is why can't we and if if you're saying it's about being empowered woman and being a strong woman then why wouldn't we want more women right where the number on victims when it comes to rape and attacks\nAnd murders why wouldn't we want more women are aware of how to fight back and how to protect themselves especially on campus because you know we're dealing with you know no campus carry right now\nNo it's absolutely true it's I'm tired Jones echo your Jones on Twitter ... dot com they'll get our music on our tunes on Amazon una spoken about how you had been object to fight in your career a lot of people treated you like less than a human being just a woman who could\nStream we tell it didn't you're much more than that I'm as somebody who's been through that as you watch the Kavanaugh hearings as you watch the fact\nThat um that he's probably going to be confirmed are you still have the ... he's a serial rapist would fall it's do you have somebody who's really been through this\nTo what we know at least two of the allegations have it looks like they were completely false and Dr Ford believes that she was abused probably not by him what are your feelings as you watch this unfold as a as somebody who truly understands you know being object dividing and possibly victimized\nVictims are in trouble here on the when when you have non victims claiming something directly\nGo real survivors of abuse are in trouble and you have to understand what's going on now is two things to separate things when you have women come forward and say I've been attacked I abused what you're what you're saying now is that well we have that\nRight so you have a lot of people going well we can leave them if they don't have proof or there is not\nSomeone who ... story but sometimes there is no one to cooperate a story sometimes it's just her you know so you have these situations now where are we going to believe the woman real survivors of abuse women who really have been abused this is a scary narrative to even question because I Do believe in due process I Believe that you should hear both sides and then we\nFigure it out but at the same time you can't just take someone's word for it because they're bad people want to say oh well he did this to me\nAnd really it was he didn't do anything to you but you just didn't like him or I mean to you know you can't\nMake it\nFair process but unfortunately what it is going to do I think for most CEOs CFOs and the masses of companies that hire\nMen or women do they're going to go with that in the workplace because of this unfortunately and it's actually going to affect women in the workforce more than ever\nI've been driving the you're absolutely intelligent to say that this was going to hurt women it's just like the the boy who cried wolf ... you're just not going to believe it\nAnd we should take every allegations seriously but when we told you that the notion that\nWe have been abused let me just say this because I Am a survivor of abuse not only that went on in my home but also went on in the music industry with myself okay\nWe don't ... it's not funny\nAnd it we don't do a baby talk there's an anchor that you go through as a woman and then eventually forgiveness and it's real thing and it shouldn't be joked and mocked and when ethanol is making a joke I bet you it's not\nA just war it's not okay because of use should cross party lines it's not in our Arctic thing it is across the board throughout our world unfortunately\nVery real issue so how\nDoes that dumped it bubble of\nThings to me we have any proof they did any of these things and then the other girl that came up for the Kavanaugh stuff said if he did it yeah I don't remember who abused me but I Will never forget it and as a survivor it's appalling to me that we are turning this a few you know

you just a a bright shining face this time of the day glad to see [laughter] and ah let's let's\nHop right to our salute to America\nBoy my salute to America I could probably take up the whole show talking about this but uh I was traveling last week to see my brother in the Sacramento area uh he's in the radio business and we are put to putting something together that's very special that\nProbably over the next couple of months we will be rolling it out can't let the cat out of the bag quite yet but one of the uh uh we had an opportunity to go to a multiple sclerosis\nAdvancements center and I'll tell you I'm going to talk about this as the salute today\nBecause it really changed my life it it really\nHas me looking at things in a different manner I actually called it's actually called the multiple sclerosis achievements Centre located\nIn the Sacramento area and we specifically we're on a mission on an assignment to go visit with a gal who's now in her mid seventies and uh for a number of years had been a in a number of TV commercials and the uh the eighties and the nineties\nAnd also on Mork and Mindy so we got to ask her a little bit about all the cast and certainly Robin Williams and Pan Am ... and all that but why we were there was\nTo talk to her and to get a sense in a feel for where she was diagnosed\nWith multiple sclerosis about Fifteen Years ago and not knowing really what we were going to be experiencing we got to meet the people behind the scenes who work with these individuals so the salute to America not only goes out\nTo those who have this dreaded disease and who are wheelchair bound but to those who have given their lives to serve these people are the achievements center is one of six year in the United states\nAnd what was fascinating was the spirit the the esprit de corps\nThe entire atmosphere of everybody who was there which there were probably about twenty five people there\nAre in wheelchairs and their outlook on life now this was a Thursday that we were there and one of the gentleman that we spoke with a quadriplegic all he could do he had a little instrument that was about just right across from his mouth and a little ball\nThat he would be able to use a computer he could talk but he couldn't move anything and had it not been for that apparatus and somebody had just done a screen shot of from the torso up you would never know that this gentleman\nUm whose name\nBut ... but he made the comment he said Thursday is the most important day of the week to me this is what I live for and if you think you're having a bad day 'cause you're French fries or cold for McDonald's or Starbucks messed up your drink think about these individuals\nWho are wheelchair bound and who are dependent upon others to help them and so I asked the question I said Bob at what point did you realize that you had to surrender\nSo that you would then allow other people to help you because you cannot feed yourself you can't shave you can't bays you\nOr in a worst position by not having the right types and kinds and amount of life insurance in place and number two is disability this was interesting or going back to my\nMultiple sclerosis achievement center it was\nA unsolicited but ah the gal who we were talking with said mark and my brother Paul uh I got to tell you something because I asked\nHer how you doing right now financially how are things going for you she said there was a young man who had just gotten into a life insurance business and I felt very sorry for him and so what I did and she was a member of the Screen Actors guild she said I\nAnd I bought a long term care policy from this gentleman because I felt sorry for him fast forward to today she is still receiving benefits\nFrom that disability policy and from that long term care policy now unbeknownst to her at that time she thought she was doing him a huge favor and perhaps she was financially\nBut in retrospect and look at how much of a great thing he put in place for her had she not had those two things to be drawing income from who knows where she would be so disability is number two number three is retirement\nThe goal today for many people is to try and get the highest rate of return they can from their portfolio in my opinion whether that's in a four one K. plan or an IRA or in a brokerage account\nThat should not be the focus the focus should be our use saving a enough money to day\nTo make it through retirement\nIt's not about ready to return it how much are you saving and if you're in your thirties and forties you should be saving about Fifteen\nPercent of your income that's what you should be saving for retirement don't look at me that waitress in your glaze dies or perhaps his thinking man Mark I'm nowhere near that amount okay Fifteen Percent as you get closer and closer to retirement because hopefully you bought all the stuff\nYou've taken most of the trips you've done most of the improvements around the house let's\nTry and raise that between twenty and twenty five percent it's not about ready to return\nIt's about how much are you said are you giving yourself a chance a shot at making it through retirement by saving enough\nMoney not just about rates of return we're gonna talk about this during the second half of our show today it's not about assets when you get into retirement it's about income and for many people that's very difficult to digest but I digress let me go back to the fourth peril and the fourth Farrell is long term care\nI'm a broken record yes\nBut it's so important that people get their arms around having an elder care plan in place that addresses the need should want to rise when it comes to having\nA life changing event something that's debilitating perhaps you're able to stay in your home but for many people it's they have to go to a skilled nursing facility and assisted living facility of some type\nDo you have a plan in place I mentioned the perfect the ideal plan\nAnd what does this have it has everything to do with the ... of life the five perils of life are always addressed in the perfect ideal financial plan that's what we'll do a number five our taxes\nI Want to read you something here that are just really just came across\nIn one of my emails recently there's a new movie I've I've talked to this is a this is a different kind of movie but I talked to a book about a book called the power of zero which addresses the fact that it is a possibility for some people that when they get into retirement\nThey are in a zero percent\nTax bracket well this has been so profound this information has been so moving and so stirring they're actually coming out with a movie\nSometime this month if not in November called the power of zero with the subtitle that tax\nTrain is coming and it's a major Hollywood documentary with\nAn all star cast George Shultz PHD's David Walker\nCPA who used to be the controller general for the United states it's lot who many people know as Mr IRA he's been on PBS a number of times gentleman named Tom Heck no who we've actually had on our show Ben Miller and then David McKnight the gentleman who's really responsible for the content the power zero\nAnd it takes it an in depth look at how the U.S national debt is setting the stage for massive tax increases\nWithin the next ten years and how they'll impact a retiring generation\nOf baby boomers it says this is the first movie ever\nEver to explore our nation's looming debt crisis and the proactive measures baby boomers people like you and me can take to protect their retirement plans from the crush\nOf higher taxes so this is going to going to be released nationwide pretty soon here because the movie makes the contention taxes will be increasing\nTax deferred accounts\nLike four one K. plans and I are age or a huge liability in a rising tax environment think about that many of you who have four one K. plans you're thinking mark what in what are you talking about\nYes the movie is going to discuss why tax deferred accounts like four one K. plants in IRAs or a huge liability\nIn a rising tax environment it makes sense doesn't it the map doesn't why do you get out to retirement and you're in a higher bracket because the government desperately needs money although all those funds that you'd deferred way way back twenty thirty maybe forty years ago when you were in a lower tax\nBracket being pulled out in higher bracket is that fair well does anything the government do is does anything that they do fair I don't think so\nAnd why baby boomers point number three in this movie why baby boomers should consider transferring money into tax free alternatives like Ross IRAs and life insurance while taxes are still historically\nLow see we talked about that\nWow it's great that they're actually coming out with a major motion picture documentary\nThat talks about this it's just not Martin Kenney here in little Tucson, Arizona this is going to hit the theaters across the country\nThis is life changing information the question is are you going to pick up the phone and give us a call and say mark you talk about this I Want to know if I'm a candidate how can I possibly get in these zero tax bracket is that even possible\nWhat can I start doing today now maybe it won't get you to a zero but what if we can save your ten Fifteen Percent maybe even twenty percent would that be worth it to you is that worth picking up the phone and giving us a call\nWe think it is and then on the flip side what if we can get you another thirty to fifty percent increase to retirement income guaranteed\nWe've seen it as high as Ninety percent mark that sounds way too good to be true well some of those things in life that do sound too good to be true are indeed true this is one of those things take me up on the offer give us a call\nTwo nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five go to the Web more F. S. dot com the smart money master plan Tom ...\nWalker the optimize their packet I have a challenge I'm challenge each and every week to try and keep the optimize their packet below five six seven eight ten pieces of information and articles that I can email to you because\nI seem like more and more stuff is coming across my desk each and every week that is indeed life changing\nIn the past we talked a lot about annuities about how important they are we do want to discuss those in the second portion of our show here why annuities because things called pensions are no longer for the most part around the pension guarantee corporation is in deep deep doo doo\nMany plants that are still out their pension plans are underfunded what if we could put together construct with great great emphasis on the receiving that thirty to fifty percent what if we could create a pension plan that gives you that additional thirty to fifty percent\nWould that be of interest to you hardly have cracked open anything here during the first portion of our show but we do need to take a little break want you to stay tuned hang in there with us we'll be right back with more life changing [noise]\nWhen you think about it [noise] life is all about the choices we make\nIn retirement so I said don't believe me don't believe what I'm saying over the airwaves get these pieces into your hot little hands read up on the unique features found in income annuities\nThere was an article I was reviewing it even before I was coming to the station today and it's called the crisis in retirement planning\nAnd it's by a gentleman named Robert merchant M. E. R. T. O. N. and noble a Nobel laureate in economics so this guy you know this does capture your attention when you find out this guy's a Nobel laureate in economics he's probably got some interesting things to talk about\nSo while he talks about has to do is really the absence nowadays of what we call pension plans\nAnd what has happened over the years and he points it out and most of us who are forties fifties or sixties know that four one K. plans have for the most part\nReplaced pension plans and\nTraditional at well what's interesting to me is how can we get back how can you as a consumer who maybe doesn't have the opportunity to become involved in a traditional defined\nBenefit pension plan how can we get you back there\nOr we can do it through what we call lifetime income annuities because traditional defined benefit pension plans were conceived and managed really in essence to provide members with they guaranteed lifetime income\nBut we're we we are really attacking this field called retirement planning really reverse in reverse as I said in the first person who are so many people are focused on look at what my four one K. plan returned last year\nLook at the rate of return I received look at how well it did\nIt make you say that regardless of how much they put in\nBut if your goal is to make sure when you get out to retirement that you are going to be receiving X amount of dollars in income irrespective of the rate of return\nIt achieved over your lifetime then wouldn't you want to know today if you were actually putting in\nEnough money that's the goal the goals should be March when you come in am I putting away enough money in retirement assuming I'm going to earn ... percent on that money to even have a chance\nOf making it\nIf nobody has ever shown you what that's going to look like then perhaps you need to pick up the phone and you should call us if nobody has ever shown you based upon what you're doing right now how much you are going to have in retirement\nThan shouldn't you know today so if if indeed one of our recommendations is Mr and Mrs client you need to be socking away more money you've told us\nThat you're comfortable with assuming you're going to earn five six seven percent on the money that you are investing in your four one K. plan but\nWhat if you are not putting enough money aside wouldn't you want to know that today\nMost people would say yes I Want to know that today but then when you get out to retirement let's assume you've met with us we've shown you what you need to do today because you're maybe ten Fifteen Years away from retirement or if you're a young person like for instance\nWhat instrument do I need to be looking at today so that I have a chance and I have options when it comes to retirement\n\nWe will show you those instruments we will help you navigate the maze of different products that are out there in the marketplace all the noise that you hear through the different mediums be at TV or radio or newspapers or magazines or the Internet or social media\nMark I'm confused what do I do\nSo when you come in and you tell us your story you then clearly helpless to define what is available and what you can or cannot do with where you are currently\nSo remember you get out of retirement were climbing that mountain the example I've used months and months and months over the last year probably use the mountain climbing example you're climbing up the mountain that the accumulation phase you've reached that to the top you plant the flag you're smiling from\nSheikh the cheek you're so happy he made it but now you have to descend go down back to the bottom to Base Camp that's called retirement\nAnd that's where most of the tragedies most of the injuries most of the ... the talent these occur is because it's the most dangerous track\nThat you could have won it means climbing up or down the mountain it's the downward descent\nSo we will help you understand how important it is and what priorities you need to establish today because of the trouble is that most people have the wrong goals they have the wrong measurements\nAnd unfortunately Wall Street has been very misleading and a lot of circumstances\nAnd so our goal is to help you obtain a crew of creed accumulate the right amount of money so that when you do get to retirement you have any chance\nOf making it the ideal plan takes all of that into account and that's why\nAn annuity for many people is the answer because the annuity mimics or mirrors what many defined benefit plans\nDid for many people who are retired maybe Fifteen twenty Thirty years ago many people maybe who are listening are receiving pensions why don't we create your own personal private pension plan we can do that the sooner you get started the better\nAnd so we're probably going to I'm probably going to include this piece\nIn the optimize their packet called the crisis in retirement planning see it's not about assets in this article goes on to say is that risk should be defined from an income perspective\nNot from an asset perspective it's about income in retirement it's not about assets and I see people struggle with that particularly the gentleman that come into our office because they still have working it's alive and well what we call the G factor it's greed\nThey want the most amount of income so when I say I would if I can get your thirty to fifty percent they get all excited\nThey like that\nI one of my goals is I have to try and keep ... clients I have to try and keep clients from indulging their appetite for agreed they want that proverbial cake and eat it too they want both\nAnd they also want to have guaranteed income for life there's some massaging there some mastering that we can do when it comes to that but it's possible\nBut first and foremost when you come in and you sit across the table with us we want to hear your story what's important\nTo you argue saving enough money on a yearly basis to even give you a chance of making it are you we will help you understand\nThat that's important to us it should be important\nTo you you know everybody should be focused on the pile of money when they get to the top of the mountain how big can I get that pile\nBut then what happens to most people is there in there and then not figuring out that they can't live on assets\nThey live on income\nAbout your ass as they can be lost they can be stolen they can be swindled sued divorce disseminated\nOr decimated [laughter] in a market crash they could be decimated in a market crash the ultimate success of your retirement is not about assets and that's reading right out of Tom Hanks this book don't worry retire happy it's about income and risk\nManagement folks you probably scratching your head because this is a huge paradigm shift for many people\nFor many people it's a huge paradigm shift and then they ask us which they should mark one should I be taking Social Security we will run for you that Social Security ... and report and that's part of the smart money master plan so we look at all of this\nThe ideal planned the ideal the perfect financial plan number one it should be simple it shouldn't be overly complicated you should be able to tell your spouse your kids\nYour siblings whoever is near and dear to you you should be able to tell them what your financial plan is\nAnd it could easily be just as easily saying look\nMy financial plant I've covered the five boroughs of life you could just simply say that look I've covered the five boroughs of life\nBut let's get a little bit deeper they want to go deeper they want to say look I've got Social Security covered I Know that should I pass away prematurely I've got a life insurance in my ... in place my wife is going to be\nApt to ask dot

doorman model one [noise]\nWelcome to the show and what it has been\nWe have the news flooding into the office here we must talk about it we have so much about Kavanaugh and our wonderful Senator Jeff flake from the state of Arizona who's leading the aluminum\nDo you not notice that Jeff Flake is owned by Goldman Sachs\nI think the listeners of this show no that but those of you who are Republican and you think us crazy conspiracy conspiracy theorists just make this stuff up\nYou can tell now Jeff Flake is bought and owned by the elite your now waking up it is a it is the most exciting time to live in because people are now see in it I don't have to convince that we just need to break it up\nBring it up and let the information flow because it is flowing at this point people are waking up like never before on both sides of the aisle\nIt is it is the best of times and the worst of times because the aluminum showing themselves more and more which means they are like clean lines and you know what the Clintons do they they have to deep plug before they fire\nSo it is the best of times of the worst of times we all need to find any of for war it's a very exciting thing and let's get right to it\nWe're going to do the Kavanaugh hearings here on the back half of the hour we're going to compare it to the Salem witch trials way back when and we're going to be talking about that today but here in the most important and I don't think I have to\nTell people uh how the ... he uses debt as a weapon but that's exactly what they do America's committing suicide over the past twelve months the U.S national debt has increased by one point to seven\nOh there's and it's getting worse and there's no one in Washington both Republican or Democrat has any will terrain it in\nSo we can see that there oh I'm just the crazy conspiracy this there's the thing that crypto currency is going to take over that has no debt ... associated to it of course it's going to take over we talked about last week\nHow it was J. P. Morgan who set up now blocking technology to ... to transmit arch a transfer dollars across\nA international lines will it's just a matter of time before they start using crypto which is what block technology was developed for the first place\nAnd of course those who have gold and silver ... it's a it's a mathematical certainty that those are going to go up a lot in the very near future so I Would have to say keep getting them silver coins look into that bitcoin I'm not your financial advisor but the warning signs are there\nAnd here in the headlines also doubt all time high bull market echoes the Nineteen twenties as skyrocketing sky rocket teen deficits increase [noise]\nNow this came I I think uh most people are aware of this but I don't think you understand how serious it is the first national test of the presidential alerts tech system\nYou will not be able to block it nor will you be able to opted out this is a thing we have to raise the red flag on because\nThey're going to use it ten times what they're saying they're going to use it and they're going to use it against us it might be good when we have Donald Trump as president but not when you get the next guy\nAnd then there's this and the news a facial recognition US Customs and border patrol agency is expected to complete a thirty day test next month abuse of facial recognition technology and they were screening international travelers at LAX\nAnd it was the department of homeland six a security that find that they had a combined success rate\nOf eighty five percent which is pretty good with this test and however they're looking to increase this to a Ninety seven to a hundred percent match rate [noise]\nSo we've all known that this is coming and I have a guy worked security at Walmart and he even says that they ... their cameras are extremely efficient even in the worst of neighborhoods and that they keep that data\nSo it's just a matter of time than that they introduced the facial recognition recognition technology to old past cases\nOf shoplifters and people are that the government desires to have information of and then they can attach all sorts of crimes to you\n[noise] so it's just a matter of time or the for this technology is so good and so accurate\nThere again you got to be very careful of who you're what you're doing who you're hanging out with ... la di di di di because this technology will be used to stop crimes but also can be used in the whole heap of conspiracies\nAnd then we have this article from this last week the latest in long standing debate over violent video games they do cause players to become more physically aggressive\nAnd my Chinese friend is a rich lady\nSo they saw us coming a mile away because here's where they're going to make some serious money\nAnd they told me if I stay in China let's say for chemotherapy or if you're going to pay like you have believed you could ever pay because they're going to make some money off of you they got it they're going to sue you for everything you can get how can you expect to get honest medical advice\nFrom doctors who are planning to make a year's salary off of you and your medical needs\nIn the movies that go with Michael Moore they said that with when it comes to communists and when it comes to people who are pro single payer system it's the exact opposite we work in under a system that it's not about money\nThat's what they say it but it sounds like these guys are more a venture capitalists than anyone it sounds like\nThey have to be who's going to go to school for eight nine ten years and specialize in something only be paid a standard grave wage per month or per year\nSo what you're telling me early on in your experience in a communist system a communist healthcare system is that the doctors enjoy the fact that they were treating somebody with money\nAbsolutely uh and my my Chinese friend who said the same thing she's friends with many doctors including surgeons and they will all say the same thing if we see a Westerner coming into the hospital\nAnd this is payday for us because we're treating a whole lot of people who can't afford to pay and if we are getting paid from the Gulf\nGetting anything so yeah you go in rich or you get plenty of special attention and special care but you better be ready to pay big time because they're going to make some money off of you\nThere's also an article this last week Chris about how uh the Chinese government takes advantage of those who\nAre having a child having a baby what were you read about this last week happening there in China and when it comes to delivering children sort\nWas an article printed in New York Times back in may in regards to women that have their children and then we're not able to see their children are in the maternity ward or have their children brought to them unless they paid the nurses in order to uh have them see\nAnd so that was the the discussion of that article was that the hospitals are nurses maybe even more particular were charging these patients these women that just have birth to be leaving sea and hold their children\nWhat would happen if someone was having a child what I mean with what you've read Leon with what you know or what would happen if a young lady who was clearly pregnant went to the hospital and was delivering a child but couldn't afford it didn't have that credit card\nYou would be my guest that they probably would not treat or at least not in most of the hospitals because once you make the commitment okay we're going to bring you through this delivery there's going to be a certain expense to the hospital and staff\nAnd if she doesn't have it I mean I've seen this in Laos another communist country did you get turned away at the door at the hospital I'm Sorry where's your money do you have cash on your preferably a or do you have a credit card that we can test if we can't run that I mean they did that to me\nUh before I got medication before I got my next ivy they were ... they were running the credit card of my rich friend and they expect that I had the money they're checking me\nYeah what are they going to do to people that they expect don't have money I I I Can't say authoritative and I don't know this but I Would guess they're going to be very slow to take that kind of a patient\nWow I mean that is what that that is the exact opposite picture we're given in Michael Moore sick go when a Bernie Sanders in so many other left these talk about a single payer system it is the complete opposite that everyone is welcome that we're going to make it available for every body\nThat we will all be healthy in their utopia\nNotice of Bernie Sanders and Michael Moore not on Medicare they've got their own private doctors they're not showing up to the emergency room and just seen a general practitioners happens to be there\nIn China it's impractical I mean if your hospital you got doctors and nurses that are taking a pregnant women and not charging them how many pregnant women do you think are going to be showing up at that hospital tomorrow between one and two million I mean it's simply impractical to offer a poor\nPeople free care in a country of one point two billion people on what you bought a billion I my poor\nSo it just seems that Michael Moore the lefty is a Bernie Sanders costs Cortez really don't know what they're talking about\nNow is is it all is the reality that we have to face their their cards used car salesman used car salesman and the left these these millions hundreds of millions of people who believe in and and show up to the Bernie rallies\nThey have a day of reckoning coming\nThey do they do Bernie Sanders and now Michael Moore trying to sell you a Nineteen eighty seven eastern ... as a a nine twenty eight teams Porsche and ... in the absolute different automobiles\nWe're going to do when they lose their health I think they're going to actually lose it Medicare I think they're going to lose their Social Security\nWhere are they going to do that number of people I think you're gonna die immediately because they can't get the care within a couple of days to a week and then the rest you'll probably have riots that will be on a par with antifa or the LA Riots of Ninety two\nWhile we're in China let's talk about what's happening with the Chinese church the uh the pope was recently in the news lately on what was the pope dealing with the Chinese government\nWell just in the last week it was announced that the pope has reached an agreement with the leaders of the communist Chinese government regarding the appointment of Catholic bishops in\nChina this has been a bone of contention there's been two separate Catholic churches and China one that you could call kind of an underground her house Catholic Church they they only accept a bishop that's been appointed by the pope without approval\nFrom the government and then you have the government approved Catholic Church which has government approved bishops while the pope has reached an agreement with the Catholic with the communist government in China regarding the appointment of bishops we don't know the details to it\nBut I'm Catholic leaders in China are saying what this means most likely is the pope has agreed that the communist government is going to give a list of Catholic bishops to the pope and said you can choose any one of these that you want and you can say that you were appointed them\nBut they're the ones the government's the one that gave me a list of whom they have already approved so the pope is essentially a pitcher relating to the authority of a communist government in China regarding who their bishops are\nLet's make it plain and clear ladies and gentlemen that the pope is giving authority\nOf the church to the Communist Party\nAnd if he did it there of course he's going to do it at the un of course he's going to do it here or wherever else in the world so this is Mike Mike plead to the Catholic people out there it's time to come out of Babylon you need to get out of there before they corrupt you more\nFurther more this was in the news that China is trying to rewrite the Bible forcing churches to sing communist anthems\nThe Chinese government\nUh is supervising a five year plan to make Christianity more compatible with socialism\nAt it that is absolutely impossible if you follow a true Christianity and the Bible or their their polar opposites cause socialism is derived from hell\nOr in which there will be a rewrite of the Bible see this in your comes at rewrite again we're talking about this last week they like to rewrite the Bible you see all these versions springing up out of the Bible that just simply absolutely is not true and it's just ... people's political beliefs\nGod's word will not pander to people we've learned this through thousands of years it does not God does not care about your opinion he puts his word above his name\nAnd it will not be distorted\nWhere what what what did you see coming in China what what do you think's gonna\nHappen well you know it's interesting because the pope's representatives uh a couple of months ago applauded China as being a government that supports Christian principles love your neighbor the good Samaritan take care of the poor watch out for the for the needy\nAnd so forth filled the pope's representatives have\nA communist government already\nAnd so the idea now that we're going to shape our Bible in order to promote socialist ideas the pope's already said socialist ideas are good Christian ideals there's there there there's there is no separation of socialism from Christianity as far as ... concerned\nMhm [noise] what I see is again I see a mass awakening people are waking up and they're seeing that the Vatican is loose a fair in that the Vatican has nothing to do with the Christian faith\nAnd more people are going to wake up I think the uh what is the hash tag walkouts as people leave the Democratic party 'cause they're too they're seeing that it is communist it's nothing to do with being a true liberal or being a true Democrat even\nAccording to us because we don't get we do not agree with them politically and they're against our loose a fair and hateful femi Nazi religion and that's what it is it's a cult or religion they're guilty and don't think for a second that there's people that have power or power at risk here\nAnd I believe that when it comes to abortion is nothing more than human sacrifice human sacrifice to women's own leisure or whatever you want to say but\nAre doing it for birth control that's the reason Ninety nine point nine and ... percent of all abortions is simply birth control\nAnd that is a religion to them and we are sacrificing our own children and they're too early on I mean what what as you were studying up on the witch trials ... what what kind of comparisons you see\n[noise] well I see this as you point out almost a religious zealotry here going on and this was true back in the days of the witch\nTrials as well or religious zealotry you can't persuade me otherwise if someone has accused you of being a which you must be a which otherwise they wouldn't be accusing you therefore you're evil therefore you deserve to die whatever\nHappens to you you deserve it and your family with you [noise] uh and and when a person was accused of being which they would steal or they would take all of their possessions they lose their property lose their hosted lose everything\nAnd so the there's money to be made in this as well and the other thing I see is you're you're going to accuse somebody of something evil\nAnd the the evidence is only someone's vision someone someone spectral vision that can't be proven its vague enough\nThat the evidence can't be proven are disproven were simply been granted credibility because these girls say so therefore we're going to grant them credibility there there's no court case here because there's nothing to be argued we simply believe them because they accused you of being a witch\nAnd just like Christine Ford oh I'm a hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh did this to me what's your evidence where's the police report I don't have a police report I went to Taco Bell a where ah\nWhere are the witnesses well they came out and the ones that are still alive from thirty some years ago and those who we know that were there they testified against what I said\nWell that doesn't matter that doesn't matter uh he drug beer notice how and I think one of the things about a ... going back to the Salem witch trials the they they suspected that a which would have some sort of pork to or like AT T\nFor animals to suck from\nOnes are ... dead ones or something like that and so you always tried to find that Pete said that that that uh the animals would suck from they always try to find a little in del uh a little blemish well that reminds me of Brett too oh he drunk beer oh he drank beer\nHe drank beer fee through I said someone he threw I when I got in ... oh my goodness you know and he must be guilty he has to be guilty tell us in the reporting through ISIS someone at a party in Nineteen eighty wow they're ... you know he he doesn't have the temperament\nTo be a Supreme Court judge because he was a football player back in Nineteen gain eighty three\nI mean any drink beer oh my goodness the there's that little blemish they try to find and that's you know I mean come on as if these accusers too don't drink beer as if they didn't do these things back in high school\nI mean let let's kind of get real\nWhen I think about this too and I think about the Salem witch trials there you had a lot of cardinal people trying to figure out a spiritual problem\nAnd anyone who knows anything about casting out demons knows that if you're going to I mean if you really want to find one all you need to bring is the name of Jesus because once you bring the name of the name of Jesus and\nThe real which will go into convulsions okay you don't need to get them in water you don't need to find that teach you don't need to do these crazy rituals I mean if anything\nOh man say Jesus is Lord Jesus was lord like ten times at there's someone not saying that there might be something wrong with them because technically a demon is really going to get\nA they're not going to be able to do it so if that person is possess at the time they're not going to be able to do it or they're going to become extremely uncomfortable the demon will show itself especially with the name of Jesus disadvantages so powerful\nGuys what do you think well it's\nThe blood of Jesus which covers all of our sins and his his blood that these demons hate and actually through that they have to flee they cannot stand in that presence they cannot hear those words they hated so much\nAnd I don't know I don't know if Jeff Flake is demonic but he's definitely corrupt 'cause I just so happened to look at his donor list and Goldman Sachs was on the top of it so I didn't I didn't have to study very far\nBut there too I think this is a this is a still a secular problem when we're ... the one we're talking about this confirmation hearing or when we're talking about these a cult test trying to block so they could find their ultimate solution any other cardinals solution\nHowever I think that's I think the stakes had been raised I think the evil ones are showing themselves more and more\nWhat he thinks certainly we've seen that across the board since we saw that under the Obama administration with all\nThe behind the scenes things that were going on from the IRS center Lois Lerner\nTo uh what was a attorney general Eric Holder and the shenanigans he had\nA John Brennan and his CIA a a nonsense was going on so it was certainly they're under the Obama administration than they thought Hillary and all her minions we're going to come in office when they got ousted in ... came in that's when we've seen these people go literally ...\nAnti first come out of the woodwork all these other folks all these other actors actresses actors\nCrazy going off the deep end flipping out news media flipping out so it's a they're they're showing who they really are\nYeah I mean if it was me I Would take this into a spiritual fight and bring in the name of Jesus right there in the confirmation hearing and watch Dianne Feinstein go into a compulsion\nBut I'm not on a I'm not I'm not voted and right now and and and see all the senators and and really have a a a come to Jesus meeting and find out who is really good and who is really evil because that is what we are talking about in the end of the day this is a fight for good versus evil\nOr furthermore now let's take it back to notch back to the secular\nIf this woman is found guilty of false accusations and perjury she deserves jail I looked it up\nSince that's all of this fiasco happened if someone falsely accuses another person of rape in the secular world or in most jurisdictions the punishment is one year of prison or jail\nSometimes it's a little less ... depends on the circumstances of course the print depends on the judge but you weren't looking into jail time\nThis woman should be looking at jail time and when we have suspicions that Christine Ford\nIs part of a self hypnosis used to retrieve and create artificial situations\nThere needs to be a call of an investigation not on Brett Kavanaugh who has all the witnesses on his side but on her she knows needs to become the defendants the Democrats need to become the defendants and there needs to be an investigation on her and wasn't Christine for isn't she had democratic operatives\nPart of what is it a pharmaceutical company or plant dirt roads\nI represented the pharmaceutical company that makes the one thing that they do it is the abortion pill or you four eighty six [noise]\nAnd so my thought is on this is could this just be about abortion well old thing yeah cabin arch out\nAbsolutely it very well can now that drug is not illegal correct correct so she's not supporting illegal drug it ... legal right now is the abortion derive is the abortion pill and so\nLike you're saying could that be an influence of course it can't because this guy could be the this guy could be the swing vote in Chris I mean\nIf it were me if our Brett Kavanaugh all man\nI Would make it my mission to ... roe v way\nAmong other things as well yeah I mean the abortion is just a one ... one of the issues that the left this would seek to keep a in play that's why they don't want Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah and you see how a you remember how every time a Supreme Court comes to a decision all the judges or what is that right a dissertation\nOn why they came to the decision that they can choose a couple of pages long they're quoting a lot of other different cases that ah I compare this to and they bring in their own ideology interpretation of the constitution I Would just simply saying my dissertation I'm doing this for Dianne Feinstein\nI'm doing this for Nancy Pelosi I'm doing this for every said panicked harlot out there who is trying to use the judicial branch as ... as a basically legislate from the bench yes which", "show_name": "James T.
