I'm delighted\nThat Democrats have poured thirty eight million dollars into the race and works as he will not share it with other candidates\nSo that's money that could have gone much more competitive races in places like North Dakota\nSo um I think it's it's crucial for America's safety that the Republicans keep both houses of Congress so that the ... the house of representatives doesn't become a nonstop impeachment show trial but um I I don't think a cruise is going to lose to to Iraq I think\nPart of the reason the polls showed cruises vulnerable for a while was because the bad blood from the presidential race I was a Cruz supporter through the convention my girlfriend hated when he did at the convention I kind of liked it I rallied to ... you know during the general election but still they're still bad blood 'cause\nThere's a lot of support for Trump in Texas and a lot of people were irritated with his dog it fight against the president I don't agree with that but you know that was one of the things suppressing ... cruises support Trump has come to Texas and done rallies that its Cruz has worked well with President Trump\nIt's funny in the last debate\nOr work was trying to run away from the rest of the Democratic party he was talking about how he could work with the president uh you know he's worked with with Republicans in Congress but his saying that he could work with Trump better than cruise cruise pointed out you have called for President Trump's impeachment\nDoes not mean somebody the the Donald Trump is going to [laughter]\nActually I mean it it if if I were elected in Texas it'd be like we didn't have a senator senator had died and we just decided to leave the seat open because that's how little impact you would have\nLooked on the other hand drawn his views real ... just to twenty twenty as though I mean we've seen people sort of short changed the\nThe process I've always thought that a lot of people had to go through to become president you expected them to perhaps run for the house the Senate maybe become a governor run a state for a while get some real experience we saw Obama short cut that\nBy saying oh I don't doubt that I can be in the\nState legislature in Illinois I'll hop right to the Senate all immediately start running for president I'll spend very little time and accomplish almost nothing in the Senate never having run a big organization of any kind never find the\nFront of a paycheck be short cut all that is Beto O'Rourke thinking well run for Senate or get some named million earning a raise a bunch of money and then in twenty twenty all run on my good looks and charm\n[noise] yeah I think you know somebody to sit down with Robert Francis overwork and say just because you drive drunk asleep is seen as an accident does it make you a Kennedy\n[laughter] that is a great line I Hope I Hope you've already said that one out\nBut now it's disturbing it's for\nOwn you know I Want you to put that one on Twitter because I'm so tempting\nBut now it's just an answer for your\nAudience I Know I Want you to put that one on Twitter because I'm so tempted feeling that if you don't put it on a ...

I've said to people we all say well he only made a few billion dollars I said that's very hard to do ask anybody who's inherited a giant amount of money how hard it is to turn into a really large amount of money and I said and then go back\nAnd ask yourself if you would inherited a modest some by comparison from say you inherited fifty million dollars and you went down to your best financial advisors said well what can I Do with this and he said well fifty million times five four or five percent\nYou can sit back and collect two and a half million dollars a year\nYou know two hundred thousand dollars a month and you'll never put your money at risk and you can sit on the beach with two fifty\nThousand dollars a week you could check into the nicest hotel in ...\nAnd sit there for the rest of your life or a hop on a plane every week and go somewhere else and you could do that and Donald Trump didn't do that he didn't say I'm going to take all this money and I'm going to camp on the beach and have parties and he said I'm going to put all the money at risk and at one point\nOf it you make Eighteen and are your girlfriend makes sixteen you said\nAbout yeah about she works in the restaurant industry says she gets tips too you know like she she makes minimum wage plus tips\nRight so she's making maybe thirty thousand a year and you're making about thirty ... so you're making seven sixty five Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\n[noise] close to it about you know a little less than that but yeah OK auto asked\nBut you want your fellow you know hey spare hold on you want your fellow taxpayers to help you pay your bills\nWhy well well here's a here's where it is you know I was paying all my bills\nI'm not I don't have any like extra curricular things on spending money on doing the average life\nYou know I Try to get a car payment I got I got that on paying you know but why ...\nWhy do you think it's immoral for you to ask your fellow taxpayers to to help pay your bills why don't how about this make more money\nHow can they are paying how come how come capable of working get is out and I don't want I Am working ... or leave me around\nI'm the first guy you're going to talk to who's going to say\nIf somebody is able bodied ended up working age they need to have a job and we need to start having these work requirements that the president is pushing their Kris Kobach is pushing it in Kansas we need to have people in office who will say if you're capable of working and there are seven million open jobs you need to go get one of them\nAnd if you can't live within the paycheck yearning now\nI've got two suggestions either reduce your spending or increase your work activities find something you can do where\nThe two suggestions either reduce your spending or increase your work activities find something you can do where your work is worth more\nSo and and that's almost every I can you name me a job anywhere in America where somebody cannot learn how to do an additional skill that makes them worth another two or five or ten dollars an hour named the job as an pot\nI couldn't I couldn't and and I I mostly agree with you I used to work two jobs that they know that two or three jobs my whole entire life me too we got kids now\nWe've got kids now and ah I don't I'm not really a big avid fan of you know kids go into sitters so Juan migrants to they're they're really expensive uh now changed their\nThey day here on how much I'm making an hour\nOkay I I got and I can I Do is let me do a test with you here's an idea yeah live next to people there are other people in your neighborhood right\n\nOkay how about tonight when you get home from work or tomorrow when you're off\nGo around and knock on doors in the neighborhood and say I don't make enough money to live the way I'd like to live would you give me a thousand bucks and and maybe even make it easy to give me a thousand bucks this year would you give me eighty bucks a month would you feel comfortable asking your neighbors for some extra income\nHe I wouldn't personally\nOkay and that and yet you if you want the government to go collect the money from the people and then give it to you what's the difference between you asking your next door neighbor he could just spare me an extra hundred bucks a month for doing nothing for you\nYou you won't ask your neighbor for it but you want the government to come take it from your neighbor the point of a gun and give it to you is there any moral difference between those\nUnder the impression that I'm not already paying for this service what service not doing that with the well are they taking the money for me since I'm a taxpayer\nThey are but in theory what we should be\nI Can't have how can they can how can they don't take that money and just keep it it's well I Want to pay for somebody else they did ...\nDid about a year ago the U.
