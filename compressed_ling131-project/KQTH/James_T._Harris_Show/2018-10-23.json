Emma Gonzalez she was there to would be in Vermont of all places we live in Florida\nThey're only out there for political reasons and when you say things that you know to not be true I think I'm with you I don't know how you can possibly you know defend any more\nI I got a question you Joe yeah\nWhat is that if you want your schools Harding right you want to protect it teachers and your students why why am I ever thought why don't I just someone that I really want I Want to protect our kids right but if I actually had a gun or if I'm not saying I Want to take guns away from people\nYou know I'm a I'm a conservative so I I really want us to stay neutral along a along this whole matter just protecting school yeah but if the political uh and and now I'm at a political uh I'm getting drawn to our side because I just want the school's safe and our teachers say\nRight now I'm with you it's a Republican he's done a ton to try to fix it fix it is what you should use or on Twitter I'm watching the debate last night and you were mentioned by Ron dissent is the former congressman the Republican running for governor I'm\nYou've met with him extensively he wants to fix it he even said your name and he said your daughter's name and he said fix it has the Andrew Gillum or his campaign reached out to you or anybody else other than those who are politicizing this has he wanted to work with you to fix it\nNow added that any Democrat that reached out to try and fix it because they were on the agenda is gone and granted it's not how we get a heart and the schools how we're going to make and\nDemocrats that are reached out to me to try and fix it because they were only agenda is gonna granted it's not\nHow we gonna heart and the schools how we're gonna make entry points how are we going to work on mental illness it's all about grabbing guns and it's just a distraction or what we can get done or if we worked together but evidently we can't work together so I Want school safe and and that that's my agenda jail or a drew\nGillum last night the Democrat who's challenging a round as soon as the soup is the Republican or for governor the governor's office is going to be open the major is going to go because Rick Scott who's running for for Senate\nGillum last night didn't sound to me or do look to me like he was willing to say I will remove Scott Israel if I win\nScott is real screwed up it was it was a complete mess with the sheriff in Broward County and then he went on CNN and talked about how amazing his response was this guy has to do when I talked to the same as last week and you know this or he said yeah I Would have to review it and and possibly make a change their\n... what would Gillum do as far as you know you live there to to change\nUm the safety aspect the dangers that our kids face in school\nI'm Glad you asked me that show because I listened a last night in that debate and he asked for both of people running last night about about school safety and when it around the safest about school safety Parkland\nHe knew the issues he brought up superintendent once he brought up the promise program he brought up the sheriff\nHe brought up to the you know those leniency policies that led a dissent white or ... ... and so he knows about what happened in Parkland yeah get all he did all he did was ask him a all he did was mentioned uh the n._r._a. right you know\nThey kept on saying that the Centers for some reason and we used to see you find you've been to say this was somehow bought and paid for by the honorary he didn't answer the direct question whatsoever on what it is he's going to do to make schools safer and in fact he he he didn't really comment much on the piece of legislation that you help bring Scott get done\nExactly Joe so that that's why I reach out if if even had any democratic listeners out there I urge you do you want your school say okay and if you want to change\nThe oh just vote party in line in this race it's so important for the state of Florida that that we have a governor that that's going to make a difference that you know look at what happened in what went wrong and try and fix things not a guy that's just going to be like every other politician that comes to park land\nAnd wants to just blame gunk if it was just a gun I I Would agree with them\nBut I Know otherwise Joe I don't know the entity that sale\nAnd I know so why if you're a Democrat don't just vote on the line right here in round this time\nOr wherever you are in Florida\nI I'm I'm Talking to ... to every Democrat out there looking at that what what brought the census dancer wants last night or how he knows what happened in Parkland and and get on this just a quick to point the finger at the end All right\nDid I think that it's a it's a it's a selling point because again be survivors who have been so incredibly political since February that's all they've talked about as the ...\nThe ... he was embarrassed going to read in ... to make him going get it ready to make can kill anybody I mean the n._r._a. and I've never kill anybody don't ever plan to unless of course have to defend my family and my stuff on it because the ... already exist that doesn't mean that is why we have school shootings that's ridiculous in fact\nUm when you were watching it last night that well let me ask you this because a lot of people watching and I do have Democrats and watch and listen but they only watch I'm listening to see if they can't find somebody that so they can attack\nHaving said that when you got together with Ron descended this did any but I just ask you straight up his you and I are friends of my ...\nIt's going to see if they can't find somebody that so that can attack having said that when you got together was wrong to say that this did any but I just ask you straight up as you and I are friends of mine I'm trying to you know screw year but this was a direct question did they say we need your help to help him win or did they say Ron is really concerned about school safety what did they say\nOh I'll be the first time I met Ron was at a Republican dinner and he didn't know I was there an Enron started talking about accountability at the local level are holding local fishes officials accountable and holding accountable\nSo that really hit it with me because since my daughter's death Joe no one's been held accountable except that one kid is in prison right you know all the people that dropped the ball they do their job there is no remorse in Broward County it's business as usual\nSo I listen to his speech he didn't know I was in the audience that night and he spoke things that really make sense to me right so we got\nTogether in DC when I was on a trip and we spoke just about accountability with the FBI and he wanted to introduce me to the people in the FBI to get a further questions answered because I'm white collar on those leads that that would have saved my daughter\nIs what really what it was about solving the problem\nYes it was nothing about his race his\nPets see that's amazing to me because um you're right only ... is going negative when we enter a going negative because you know the interesting things around the same as would be a good candidate I think so too um but but he doesn't say anything about fixing anything and you're looking at a garbage running one of the most dangerous cities in the state if not the country when it comes to the murder rate per capita\nYou get a I was listening to grade each other for ended up in Polk County a great guy and he asked that was incredible he said the crime rate in Tallahassee is thirty four percent higher than the crime rate in Chicago wow how's that\nCome on man and got a guy a beer who who is the the things that he said last night first of all looked like he was running against Trump\nAnd not to say this and I as a guy who lived in Florida for Twenty one years of my life my mother still lives in my my ... my sisters still live there\nI have a great connection to Florida I don't want to see a guy who wants to raise everybody's taxes who who is running a city horribly he's city is under investigation one of his closest friends\nIs under investigation I mean it doesn't make any sense to me as I was watching it last night he was very well school on what to say in how to say it but he memorized some pretty snappy lines but man it seemed to be about negative negative negative whereas I thought the same as we're saying here's what I Want to do for the state and here's what we have to do together\nSure how can a governor ... federally on a federal level\nIf all they did was trash or president do\nFor us and that whole debate you know there's things that we need federal funding for an hour and I mentioned that red tide Enron and wants to get ahead of it and he's going to work at a federal level would operas how's how's it going I'm going to work to anything in this state federally when he he's looking to impeach up a great president you know\nIt doesn't make a lot of sense of the Republican losses don't Hermeto in February and I missed the high school I'm an idiot use that website still have running what does that Americans for class dot org\nYeah ... ... and you know ... we had an ... about a week ago yeah a a a friendly or Nancy Pelosi came\nThe whole wow wow what a photo op that is you know it's kind of sick how they keep on you know a breeding these idiots through that school as if somehow that that's going to solve the problem Missy blows used do nothing to solve it Andrew Gillum has done nothing to solving Scott Israel still has a job it kind of makes me sick any\nYeah so they came here talking about background checks or to make more background checks you know to make it harder to do background checks\nYeah so I came here talking about background checks or to make more background checks you know what I make it harder to buy in\nThe background check the background check when they're shown and even ... because of the promise program she's not smart when it comes to what she's talking about but she knows that the left wing you know lemmings will just buy it back to the problem right\nThere is no background exactly right so you know that's a problem but she's just a a you know looking at an agenda of guns at ground checks because that's what she's going to come and politicized not the real issues are inevitably unrest and so he can never have a background\nAndy we always appreciate it my friend which spoke again

D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came up Paton\nA publicity and ... was also there it's a nicer you to say that but they the group's\nVery well connected with what's happening on the ground here and what I did have an opportunity to do with with me and speak with all the people that were coming through mostly young men are a lot of MS Thirteen I saw as well as just a village or farmers\nAre able bodied working men who joined it this group in Honduras as it made its way through and what I can tell you is that absolutely the information that I was getting on the ground are based on what they were carrying their backpacks and everything seems very well coordinated they had a coordinated message\nAre they very very very few of them veered off that message because there was leadership within the group you know I speak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and thank God I Do because you know you will catch people in the line\nOkay move this way don't talk to the reporters right now we're moving forward chat this say that and I said well you told me a minute ago you didn't have a leader in the group but demand up ahead is actually telling you guys what do you know so I'm assuming you're a leader oh no no no no we don't have any leaders we don't have any leaders I'd go up and talk to the gentleman\nNo no we're just trying to keep moving forward\nI said well you guys have matching backpacks you have\nYou know the flag of Honduras at the front of your group nobody in the group actually looked that tired or hungry um I was told by one of the people in the groups that they did have some bussing\nA that people were in the villages and they heard it by word of mouth or is that a criticism use uh that they were coming to America to look for jobs this is about poverty so\nVery well coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In Honduras or remember there's and you know a lot about this or there's a big battle here in a politically between the various a conservative\nOr a government and uh the socialist government so there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a you know open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here have been coordinating\nTo do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S a elections a mid term elections and create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America\nOne thing that I I find to be very disturbing or the or are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation for children and women along the way a and these are people with flatbed trucks\nOf these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to coach these are individuals or they did that in the last caravan or they're doing in the ... and the other one in and others as you pointed out\nOn their way or if something is done to stop this there will be well they're not a Sarah a group of thousands every week coming into our into our borders ...\nI'm Sarah a group of thousands every week coming into our into our borders border\nArea abs yeah ... absolutely Lauren this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there\nUh you brought up such a great point um that the women and children that were a part of these caravans of big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media\nAre in danger are in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups are according to what a mall and officials\nApparently a child a baby I'm with trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through uh the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to\nTo try to gather information to find out what's going on here who is coordinating this they talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground or the baby was buried apparently asked by some of those leadership within the group to take the baby away and bury the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body\nOr one of the reasons or the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people that were coordinating this group with either manslaughter murder\nOr because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward\nAnd for the United states and our us southern border this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups are not just regular farm workers are people for villages that are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used and they're being used\nBy these coordinators but there are some as Thirteen gang members there is some pretty bad guys and these groups to\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while\nI was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use\nBy these organizers by these governments\nAnd I I'm telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more ways that people are\nReady to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ball yeah ...\nThere's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect and people will just\nAll of Eric ... going to let us into a country and they coached them my coach them a credible fear credible here this is what you need to say when you get to the border this is how you stay in America\nAnd it's just a it's just a game I mean it's just you say a few lines and then you released to the piece of paper\nAnd a judge subs Ryan hold women and children separately you can't keep it keep them under the twenty days and then they're off to the races and it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the the provisional status they get\n... feel like a a debt of gratitude to the left and be ... Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that has Erie ... for Republicans in irreversible\nThat's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that is eerie ... for Republicans in irreversible because of the sheer numbers\nYeah a great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of the reports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegal to have voted right\nUh and and there's a shift and there's a shift in if they become citizens of course there's another shift a one of the interesting things I spoke with a somebody from immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is\nIs that for example men will take young girls you know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know as as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate\nThe child from the mother so that they just released them into the U.S with a return to court date\nSo we're seeing the catch and release it still ongoing oh we have men who have little girls they know they can't\nPut them in a holding facility with other men because they've got to a child they kept separate them so they released them so we're still seeing the same problems that we've seen for years happening right now and the president you know President Trump is it's very adamant\nAbout the fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand that but our borders are being overrun too so I think the most important thing we can do\nFor the United states where the Guatemalan government even with in Honduras right now for the hunter in government that's working against some of the socialist a\nA aspects of their of their country at political apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any us money from us aid going to find these groups\nThat are coordinating the separate than we really need to start pulling the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people ... as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from\nFrom USAID ah groups that are that are actually assisting and there's a carrot and and we're going to hold people responsible\nFor the people that guy along this track because believe me young women are being raped a there is a lot of concern with ... with children uh being uh exposed to this type of a friend us caravan this walk be put on the back of cars\nSo people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not\nI'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose who's doing this and what's going on\nOut well again ... follow the money\nSomeone's paying the fuel for these trucks someone's paying for the\nSilverado router implementing knows that you're home is your most valuable asset we wants to help you maintain that value when was the last time your home how to check you maintain the health of your body does help you maintain the health of your home coal Silverado router and plumbing and ask about our free hold inspection\nSix nine to rewrite zero zero zero once more six nine six zero zero zero zero [noise]\nThree miles outfitters Pima County new as family friendly gun shop thank you for making the annual spring shooters roundup a success gal singing a purchasing a firearm drop outs out there is a unique return policy allowing you to return your firearm and cut it into a new purchase and always special offers for military law enforcement remember they wrap love a firearm they'll last Saturday of every month robots outfitters\nDrive a little and save a lot that you know suddenly sales tax on colossal Kaye wrote about one mile north of I tend to exit two Seventy nine or visit them at ... dot com western hospitality with friendly prizes\nFor clogged traffic and whether they're honest that during his sons morning new last used on the news and talk ...
