on his staff on on like Facebook and other social media and their travel schedule is nuts we talk about that as well but there are a couple of things that happened today and I'm gonna I'm gonna bring you this all breathe a video on television I'll bring you the audio on the radio\nHillary Clinton is now saying why the Democrats had been so uncivil\nAnd she somehow was blaming the Republicans keep in mind\nThese are the people that are dividing conquer these are the people that are separate these other people that are historically known for segregation Jim Crow separate but equal this is a separate party it always has but there are also responsible for slavery and the KKK and write down on lynchings\nThe Democrats are actually saying the same things they've always said\nWhich are we must divide and conquer and separate and if you if that doesn't work and we actually see some civility we need to be uncivilized so that we can get that we can get back what it is that we think is ours so let me give me what Hillary Clinton had to say do I think God cruise gentleman poor about being civilized or not\nCannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect its strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally demeaned the confirmation process uh insults\nShutting down the voting in Florida or in two thousand I remember we flip\nThat actually never happened that actually never happened there were no Republican operatives shutting down the voting in Florida the biggest problems were in Palm Beach county Palm Beach county was being run by election supervisor who was a Democrat she's lying because she thinks well believe it\nWithout a John Kerry I remember the things that even the Republican Party dead or to John McCain in two thousand I remember\nWhat would it would have voted ... does she remember denigrating every woman who had a credible claim against her husband meet someone like Paul Jones' paid off to the tune of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars Juanita Broderick has a book out saying Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton is suing her\nI mean\nOr what they did to me for twenty five years ... followed me alive which unfortunately people believe\nThat we have all the time they lost a lot you know Christian home and poor were reporter all the way she thinks she is she would say well\nSecretary Clinton what what lies what are they saying about you that was wrong\nTime money and effort and promoting here when you're dealing with an ideological party that is driven by the left for power that is funded by corporate interests who want a government that tactics betting it's hot and you can be several but\nYou can't overcome what they intend to do unless you win elections\nHave no idea what the hell she's talking about first she said you can't be civil then you can be civil and then she complained that she was wrong to somehow when she wasn't\nIt was actually used was disgusting which she just had to say Christian I'm an poor who is I guess a left the I don't know she must be for her to sit back and listen to that and not challenge any of what Hillary Clinton just said is pretty disgusting so you can't look at her ever as a um\nAs somebody who is a a true journalist you just can't now add on top of that Eric Holder the former attorney general under Brock Obama his wing manned basically\nEric Holder said today that Michelle said when they go low we go high I say when they go low you pick up [noise]\nYour kick a Eric Holder the only\nThe only the retreat Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the far left in this country is that Eric Holder is dumb enough to say it out loud instead of just thinking it believe me all the far left wing progressive idiots think the exact thing that he just said [noise]\nThey just aren't dumb enough to say it I guess he is ... that guy thinks he's going to be the president twenty twenty keep that in mind it is I edited nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy four seven Joe packs dot com it's going to be um a line one is John in Houston I John what's going on\nThat and that will uh Joe how you doing today living the dream my friends do you make but yeah I hear your you have to\nBe able to ask you that question [laughter] ah well [laughter] what are the the the topic I wanted to talk about the Perry actually got me on this and uh it's it's a bit about the fracking and the industry the oil or that we are capable of producing\nUm I was in the Gulf of Mexico there and the Deepwater Horizon incident wow and\nAll the the crazy stuff all the crazy restrictions and all of that that happened or we actually are rigged moved to Egypt we moved to uh\nUh the Mediterranean just north of Alexandria and or just a few a few days before a Mubarak was overthrown\nYou talked or more toward\nA off the coast there uh and so I I I got to see first hand and and hear everything that people were saying about block Obama and how great he was because he was the first president and a long time to go over there and say hey we're really sorry for being so tough on you guys\nExcuse me um and and you're not as bad as we thought and we need to get more credit\nAnd oddly enough that happened to coincide with the fracking industry and uh the middle east realizing that America really could support herself right uh so they they just opened up all the tax uh oil prices crashed you know you know that whole story\nGoing on they they they got the I mean I think that fracking it was said would cause you you have to get fifty or or fifty five dollars a barrel to make fracking profitable so what they did was they dropped the price so low that it made it ridiculous to frack\nAs fifty or fifty five dollars a barrel when you can get it for thirty that's where they were trying to do that for him to shut down the fracking industry and it worked for a while exactly but fracking still does exist that is actually pick back up again\nYeah yeah you've got a couple of benchmarks fifty five dollars is one of them that's for land drilling a for their land drilling to expand you need to be at about fifty five dollars for offshore drilling to expand you need to be over eighty\nUm and and that's they knew that and that's what they did a I watched thousands of people lose their jobs not just out in the oil field but all the and celery businesses that are associated with it right just cratered hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs that you know not to mention the\nYou know a hundred and however many died on or a a survived the the Deepwater Horizon sixteen that died [noise] but um [noise] it was just amazing that the\nThe whole chain of events that took place a and then of course that also continue to lead on to the Arab Spring and and all the chaos in turmoil and everything else happened over there after that right but ah but yeah that was that was exactly what happened is that when when Saudi\nWhen Saudi and all their neighbors found out that America wanted to be\nTheir friend that we were willing to be told what we can do and what we can't do\nAnd we also threatened their oil production well [laughter] what would you do\nYou know I I it was out of it was it was about crushing our industry here and Thanks John crushing or industry here and it was about bolstering their industry there because they needed more golden palaces\nAnd rock Obama was more than happy to incite the Arab Spring by by taking away any support for Mubarak Egypt melted down thank goodness the military stepped up and stop the Muslim Brotherhood that was taking over the country was going to make it a radical ... Islamic country\nUm and then you know you you're watching in Yemen fall apart\nYou're watching the entire area the entire region\nThrough a lackluster you know ignorance of then President Obama I'm just melt down\nAnd and it it's not okay\nMade things exponentially worse there it actually allowed for the rise of ISIS by him pulling out you know our troops prematurely and I'm In Iraq it just didn't make any sense it didn't make any sense what he was doing other than to say he really did think that that region could sustain itself without us having some sort of a a say\nI think that's where their biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to a source of the issue when you\nFinally got to see what these ... bills were especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it as these things were outdated do you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety to run it will side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are still a developing a the energy sources that\nWere buying and now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada boat very different\nPositions than we were twenty five years ago so makes abundant good sense that the president would say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the\nUh uh what do we call it the uh uh U. S.\nM. C. A. United States Mexico um Ghana trade ...\nAgreement makes total sense for us to have done that we got\nA really not perfect listen uh you know I I I don't think I've ever negotiated deal while I was governor or otherwise that I Would call perfect but um this president understands how negotiate and negotiations are not\nUm without their challenges a but negotiations are generally uncomfortable comfortable for both sides but a President Trump he gets a man I'm so glad he's sitting at the table negotiating for us because America's went and uh I like when\nIt's all I Do too in the president said will get tired of winning when I'm tired of it yet it is a former Governor Perry using energy secretaries have United States of America you and I've known each other for more than a decade now if you can believe that you've always told me that you believe wholeheartedly that we could export more oil than we do import\nAnd people scoffed at that people left to bet you also have said and I think we'll get there that we can be energy independent we're now exporting more than one importing you're not surprised by it um how did you make that happen how do we how do we as a country make that happen\nWell I Want to give credit to where it's really do and that is to the private sector innovators in technologies that are\n... you know George Mitchell is a great example of the man who is really the father of hydraulic fracturing do a lot of people tell them that wouldn't work wouldn't work and he stayed with it stayed with it\nOr when you couple that with directional drilling and I might add some of that technology of directional drilling that made it possible uh and as he's him that they came up at at one of our a department of energy national labs to be able to allow the polycarbonate ... material to stay on these drill bit\nThat has so changed uh and being able to go in and horizontally drill a these are formations like the Bach and up in a north\nDakota a there was never really built if you will or to drill horizontally but when you can or excuse me a verdict late but when you can go and drill it\nHorizontally it completely changes the world ah and and the economic impact is stunning\nAnd I think that's the real story for America our best days are in front of us are the future of the oil and gas industry in America is stunningly power or the jobs that get created the wealth that gets created\nTake a look at the eagle Ford right there and you know south of San Antonio right how that changed that entire region you go up to a North Dakota and those communities up there that are just booming\nOr the the limiting factor for them today is having the infrastructure in place that can handle the workers or it's the welders it's the all of these really high paying jobs are being created in the energy sector all across the country in the Marcellus Shale up in Pennsylvania\nUh and and you want to say adjusted position crossed that Pennsylvania and New York line Pennsylvania it's it's ... up and that oil and gas area where the Marcellus has been done\nCross the line into New York where their governor and their their government in Albany has a forbidden them to hydraulic like frack are used directional drilling and then um you know the economic uh a downturn there is palpable man it's it's it's sad that they don't see\nThat American energy and it was an ... an American energy create\nIt's washing driving down the missions the emissions in America are down fourteen percent since two thousand south yeah these countries that were you know her rang and asked about getting out of the Paris Agreement and and my response to him as a lesson\nWhen you show us that you're reducing your emissions you come and talk to us about signing on to some agreements\nAll I could not ... I couldn't agree more I mean China was given Thirty years before\nThey had to do anything so none of them in any sense or each each energy secretary Rick Perry or in and you're right I I see what's happening\nAt the eagle Ford I see that it's a boom town I see there are jobs there and in North North Dakota in Pennsylvania that they weren't zero jobs it was it was desolate land um so this is all good at one last question are you going to run and I really appreciate you taking the time um I and I told you I was gonna bring this up because I talk to 'em I think our mutual friend the former vice\nPresident for nominees are appealing to nights ago on the program and she's excited as all get out Rick\nShe she says hey we're finally doing the right thing and we're going to explore Anwar\nUm that was something that was that just politics in red tape stopping that up till now\nAbsolutely I mean the previous administration didn't like fossil fuels like put the a lot of a country off\nA out of bounds if you will for expiration because they didn't like Boston field they you know they like and listen I'm I'm a big supporter of renewables as well as lead the nation and the production of wind energy back while we were governor right in the end the two thousands and they said and picking one or the other\nBut the previous administration did they picked renewables and that was it [laughter] you know fossil fuels nuclear or coal or they they are paid a price with the previous administration Anwar\nAre not only really helps Alaska or with those uh uh revenues that are coming in it is again part of the supply\nOr globally where we need to keep this supply stable and taking Iran is a\nA oil off the market agree appropriately because of their inability to be a citizen of the world that act appropriately uh\nThen you know have an Anwar coming on line you know frankly having the Russians in the end they are and the Saudis increasing their production as well all of that is important to show that we have a global supply of energy\nAnd or the United states is leading the charge you think what's happened in the last decade or we've gone from being totally dependent upon countries that didn't have our best interests to being the number one oil and gas producer in the world the jobs that get created the wealth that gets created\nThat's what the president said he would do when he was a running for office it's exactly what he is doing and um you know I for one look at it and go thank God that uh we got to present that does what he says\nHe's got well I think is a simple question would you rather have Venezuelan oil or an Iranian oil or Alaskan oil and I think that's an easy answer your governor or in in secretary I I just think you're doing a masterful job I Love you always take some time with those it is or the energy secretary for the United states of America Rick Perry Rick thanks very much so let's not be strangers\nHey Joe let's do it again God Bless

S. dot CON flick on Facebook when you get there just send me a message click on send message you'll be signed up for the for the chat messengers I send you a Facebook message about who's going to be on the show like the bottom of this hour it's going to be Senator Ron Johnson\nAnd the great state of Wisconsin to talk about the Affordable care at the un Affordable Care Act Obamacare and the lives of the left today\nThe left is actually trying to say\nThat this president President Trump\nIs trying to do away with coverage for preexisting conditions\nIts ally it's not true it's absolutely based in nothing but but fall so it's\nAh so we break that down weeks but we're also talking about his take on the whole cabinet debacle and the hearings that would just ridiculous made the Senate\nLook a bunch of idiots we're talking about the bat in about ten minutes right here with Ron Johnson but sent me a message on Facebook and then you'll get ... messages you'll get updates on who's going to be on the show what topics we have and so on\nAh like when I have a package parity I'll tell you I've got a pack started coming up a lot of people do want to know what that's going to happen a lot of people except for Kerry lucky care like it is not one to live in Hawaii by the way\nIs um he's saying do the crazy or the Mazie parity\nMhm now yeah and that as soon as I deal with the way was not crazy about Patsy Cline it was crazy by she'll agreed\nAnd it was actually a normal sparkly that did that I think they see low of course the lead singer for novels Berkeley so I'm so maybe\nI mean I I got a couple of options now maybe do that I'm not going to lose a it'd be forty five to stay in a lot that's not going to happen so we've gotten to where you're also the website click on Instagram a lot of people a lot of positive comments on how you look on the camera today\nReally that they think you look great go ... go hang in light of course there's always one person over on Facebook Celeste\nSays Gulf thinking on her on her thank you so I appreciate that\nAnd my answer just all end is never\nShed listen ever going to happen that's not going to happen you know he's so he's got that for you which is always nice as well plus a as you there I Lived tweet during the program or if you're wondering what ... how is it easier to give it to get a hold of you you either you know sent me an email or I live to eat during the program and I\nI tend to be on the Twitter is if I'm awake I'm On the Twitter said that there's somebody has to be on the Twitter all tend to see it\nUm if if the Instagram is where you go over you go see the picture of carrion polo and the new studio carry an eye yesterday or carry and me yesterday on the screen shot from Newsmax had a big hurdle will allow me to post a picture in real painted he asked me to live and they were being real whining and eleven thirty like midnight it was like two thirty in the morning and then it went in\nAnd out so yeah go check that out all the social media is right there plus a you'll see the news stories that we're talking about right in the right hand side as well\nJoe ... let me go to the phone lines on a voter ID A lot of people have a lot to say about it it's going to be a Sheryl in line to I sure what's going on\nHere every day like from or I Do not blame you\nThank you and me when I got my registration\nOh well by mail\nYou can only vote by mail and Oregon yeah you don't actually go to you don't go to a polling place all no come on man it's All right now well then how do you know who's who exactly so ... and\nBy the way the registration card and ended up itself wasn't enough either if I lose my wife ... if I lose my wallet and my voter registration card is in there somebody finds my wallet takes my voter registration card goes in votes in my name and doesn't have to show ID\nThey get to do that and then I Would be disenfranchised that's the way the photo ID actually protects all Americans so that their franchises and taken away\nExactly so who's smart idea was to have vote by mail only [noise]\nI have no idea that they changed it over and they can get a ballot in the mail you mark hey you want for your time in the back of the envelope they get in another envelope and mail it in\nMy ... if I'm gonna have to start a new segment am I going to hold on a second one\nWe can do that\nYeah really there and it's a lot in Oregon that wrong\nAnd what's interesting is there a lot of great Americans like you that live there and then you have ...\nYou know what I mean it's it's like the state would be read except you've got a couple of concentrations of people who just don't seem to get the American way and then the rest of you have to suffer we love being on an Oregon but we've got like five stations in Oregon now and we love the open line now at age eight nine four one pegs\nEditing nine for one Seventy two four seven let me quickly grab Lisa in Tennessee leads to make it fast for me what's up an\nOkay well um well they were saying that it was unfair to um blacks and Hispanics and the elderly and young people to have to have 'em and I ... you know state id right\nBut part of the reason why they were saying that is because they said that they couldn't afford it but they also didn't have transportation to get there to get the id right\nSo I don't understand how that's an argument because if they don't have transportation to go and get yeah I Do how do they have transportation to go and vote\nBut it's a great question and also to add on top of that I'm Sorry but old people young people Hispanics blacks in American Indians are all able to go and buy Sudafed you've got to show a photo ID to do that open a checking account have to have photo ID to do that\nI mean you can't you can't go and watch that Eric Holder speak without showing photo ID so that the whole thing is a ruse\nPublicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson resolutely right last question on Kavanaugh notable onto the unaffordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left is screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their mind for we're not going to kick them off the court 'cause we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams cents a day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some you know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery shop from day one\nIn the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican race in Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garrett correct you supported the president as that all Republicans and\nHas been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and and this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helps people of the major\nAmount of people that were paying that find that tax and the an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice in health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care plan and keep your families who have their previous reduce probably five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live a year\nOr they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule where President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right and they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further\nI'm a care and Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates in in Wisconsin for example health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mama care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say ... will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I didn't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if he could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums cross because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody's saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that former senator who can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the hot and care exchanges\nWe're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford health insurance for once\nOkay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of uh the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because they want single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if or if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protection preexisting condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nOr they think they can win the election but no I mean they're long term goal obviously is Bernie ... Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts it tore his single payer\nGovernment run bureaucratic system that will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax will have at least have to double business taxes at least double still won't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down to number thirty two trillion they realize how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime my friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly\nI feel strongly that bit knowing Google the Senate stay with you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly but the house is starting to look like it's up for grabs were this blue wave was being talked about for six months do you think\nThat the moves by ... Feinstein and and uh and Cory Booker Spartacus and all these people in that process\nWhere do you think that's going to motivate conservatives and Republicans to get up off their hands and go and vote November\nI sure hope so I don't I don't know ... what else\nLike a ... to just create the discussed again if you're not disgusted by their despicable ... behavior God help ya\nYa know I'm I'm with you and I think that it's going to be probably I'm a hearing people saying red dawn\nOn on on November ah six I'm not really sure what's gonna happen\nOther that people need to go and vote or else it surely will be some sort of a strange blue wave with impeachment talk and all this other garbage Ron ... million for the time I always appreciate the knowledge and thank you so much for really straightening out with this individual health or this individual's choice and health care really is because of the larger to continue for the next month and you know the\nAverage ... ... we're back after this will be Joe packed shows the writer\n[noise] ...\n[noise]\n\nThe Brett Kavanaugh matter I think this case proves the media is out of control it used to be a man was innocent until proven guilty but if you watch MSNBC and CNN\nThey see it the other way if you're a conservative like Brett Kavanaugh is well you're guilty there is an answer better media honest media there is a channel I've been watching and that I'm On Monday through friday it's called Newsmax TV and its America's real conservative news channel I like it\nYou should check out Newsmax TV as well you get great just people like Bill O'Reilly Mike Reagan Pat Buchanan so many others you can find Newsmax TV right now on direct TV channel three forty nine dish to sixteen Uber's twelve twenty and files six Fifteen\nThat's direct TV channel three forty nine dish to sixteen Uber's twelve twenty and five or six Fifteen I Love being on Newsmax TV every day and I love watching it when I'm not on and remember to go to your smartphone\nStore download free Newsmax TB app and watch them anytime anywhere in the world news max TV is real news for real people like you and me\nIf you're like my family you've got a ton of videotapes I mean VHS she might have film even photos laying around you haven't looked at him in years and they're just be generating they're not going to get any better or nicer or better quality sitting around in a dusty box or on a shelf somewhere wanna get I'm taking care of put together\nOn modern media from a great company called legacy box I Love legacy box I've dealt with them they're incredible when it comes to saving the history of your family for years to come you can get those photos that film that VHS all that stuff put right on a thumb drive you can have it on the cloud you can have it all put on a DVD and then you'll have\nIt to save forever and to share with your family for good sounds amazing doesn't it it is and you get a great deal because listen to my program legacy boxes off remind listeners\nForty percent off a legacy box dot com slash bags\nThat's legacy box dot com slash P.

of of unity in unification and it's it's it was done as as far back as Frederick Douglass in his speech what to the slave in the ... is the fourth of July we\nWere speaking to a bunch of white women but [laughter] but she you know his take away you know do\nThe horrors of slavery and yet I promote and stole the virtues of the constitution the declaration of independence these were not slavery documents these were liberty documentary them like it is in that freedom and that liberty is unit unification out of\nTime my friend but I we get the point positive unified why you have to expose the other side and fight against it at the same time stay there [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments at Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ratio and here's how it works with the rate she'll you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part of rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nAs an historian I find it fascinating as a political conservative I think there's much to rejoice to be quite Machiavellian about is is that the Democratic party is doing itself great great damage\nAnd you know you wouldn't worry if you you know if you're a conservative Republican you were if the Democrats came out and for\nStrong national defense and the tax cuts\nAnd morality at home and on the streets and law and order and and basically came out with the same positions as a Republican that because they make themselves competitive with the Republicans and then it would get down to who's better it delivering these things a lot of people still believe that Democrats are better energy in government than the than than the Republicans are\nSo but at the Democratic party was going on a direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guaranteeing a the reelection of a of a Donald Trump and two thousand twenty by making themselves so marginal so crazy so\nAh you know out there that they just are revolting to most you know decent law abiding American citizens\nWell in it and you have a situation where the former attorney general\nThe for the the chief law enforcement officer advocate violence ... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence a Hillary Clinton says you can't be civil with people who want to destroy your\nYour beliefs are so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party you had Dianne Feinstein um claim that her office didn't leak this confidential document I don't know she lake dinner for over\nYeah yeah yeah yeah from the ... let me give you ... if I may plays is that in the late sixties\nThe radical left was you know the colleges campuses world claim a radical out being funded by the KGB and she argue which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more ... more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominee George McGovern was a lunatic and who got creamed by Richard Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nSo so the Democrats swore that we're going to happen again so they they took control of the party and and nominate a centrist Jimmy Carter and won\nThe Republican the Democratic party has now spinning out of control again as it did in ah sixty eight virtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time to feeding in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because as mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was Nineteen Seventy two\nThree social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taking power this is part of the reason why\nThe left as so enraged because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post is a sad joke of itself let's face it the New York times has said Joe CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time I watched any programming on it\nFootball games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too\nYou know the lower income shell and Fox News and two of you know Newsmax and one American news and\nConservative talk radio ... blocks and and so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite there were telling their marginal viewers Marshall readers marginal listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and laugh at\nAt a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear\nCalm and this storm don't you agree with that uh\nYeah Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change it or what but but one thing they do believe is is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than Brock a bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would have done he's got a chance to improve his standing\nAs as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy can do to prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it stand is pretty well fish but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since\nYou're Reagan biographer hum so many great Reagan books\nHow Reagan dealt with them personally riots and will will play a bit of sound or those of you who missed the show last night let's listen\nTo those people who do four days in advance that if the university's sought to go ahead with that construction they were going to physically destroy the university\nHere in many negotiate what she said what is the season public institution that is right in the universe its own community in the community in Berkeley the live around\nThem and began the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they had the right to choose the law they would all day as long as they were doing and the name of social protest\nHe gets up any leads yeah yeah that point what do you know construction he was talking about oh there\nThere was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they left want to do a a build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam you know the north Viet Cong soldiers that are saying it was completely out of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler thumb and the IOC stabbed which is what it was all about\nBut what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was\nHe said warmly ruthless and if you listen to rag and he says these professors somebody if you're old enough and ought to know better you know the way he just dismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so you know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact that he he he he went right to the ... the salient point here Craig which is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions\nCan justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... that it's a huge huge problem\nBut it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of the mob is quite another by the way this idea that uh\nLook up ... tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... a ... a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political uh people but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks is exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary\n[laughter] yeah I agree with the mob one of the Tea Party when they're dressed in period garb yeah and that's\nWhy the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they\nThey're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well the Tea Party at a protest and the liberal side of protest they must be one of the same no they're not one of the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough\nRight as long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well if you if you want to want to stand up for women in algae BT and all it then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nYeah but but that may be upset this before the show I beg your pardon perhaps but the difference today between a moderate conservative leader modern concert a politician in a modern liberal politician is liberal politicians\nGoes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know\nIt but it but a moderate conservative and that's an emotional response because of because liberals going to do with the good things for you a moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power\nSo I may give it back to you have\nTo think about it you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration of that comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities and ultimately the individual where the frame or some founders intended it to be there in the first place\nAgain power to power to the people the let me try to show up that slogan but they never really ... but that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the republic\nPower to the people stays with them not some with some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a critic I Want to play one more thing fee then we're out of time now this was Jeane Kirkpatrick and it was at the Nineteen eighty four Republican convention center in Dallas yeah let's let's yeah Harry Truman\nBasic source of ours\nWe believe in the\nPresidential candidate used to talk about\nThrill outfitters Pima County new as family friendly gun shop thank you
