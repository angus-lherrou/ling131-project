the Caribbean we ... we talked a lot about the fourteenth amendment and the fact that the president said to ... some interview that he's looking at possibly doing an executive order that would stop the birthright clause in the fourteenth amendment\nI'm here to Seattle to be president can do that unless he's got a national security issue where he can certainly do some some you know in stimulating circumstances you can do some moves um that would protect the American people I think it's got to be done through changing the constitution through a um\nA vote of the states they have to ratify it\nI Do believe the fourteenth amendment says what it says which is if you're born here\nYou're a citizen here because you are in fact subject to the to the jurisdiction there of\nThe baby is the parents might not be an I've often said the parents should be sent right back by the baby's here go to foster care to go but up for adoption go to a relative who's a citizen but the parents should have absolutely no rights to stay here for some reason we misconstrued it to me that they can but the fourteenth amendment says what it says it's flawed\nIt should be fixed it should be changed what it says what it says let me go to the phone lines in the meantime CEO load welcome to outline for is going to be William and Minnesota William what's going on high\nThat joke one I've got a couple of concerns about your interpretation of the fourteenth amendment and forgive me for saying so that I think you are incorrect\nFrom just read again I'm not I'm not a ... I'm reading it but go ahead\nThe fourteenth amendment is actually very well written when you understand the meaning of the phrase subject to the jurisdiction thereof and let me let me explain allow make explain please statutory statutory interpretation requires that we consider the plain language that is you just however if you stop right there\nYour interpretation is going to be an incorrect all you have to consider the cannon to statutory can a construction when interpreting any all especially the ...\nI'm not a determining the law I I'm going to say it again because you you'd do somebody's going to be an eight hour phone call and I love you some really smart but I'm going to need you to get right to the point of where I'm wrong because as I read it it says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there up when the ...\nYeah right to the point of were wrong because as I read it it says all persons born\nOr naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there up when the person is going on in their ... stop when they're born they're subject to the jurisdiction there up this is talk about the child not the child's parent is ... I'm going to let you continue but please don't beat around the Bush I just told you directly why am right now tell me why I'm wrong go\nYou're confusing the type of jurisdiction that hit me what does it mean are sovereign jurors their sovereign jurisdiction\nThere's adjudicated jurisdiction and a\n... ... you're you're you're assuming\nYou helped me to be wrong but you haven't said anything yet again the jurisdiction of the keep interrupting me Joe okay well you and you don't allow me to actually willing to\nLower your voice Senate lower your voice I don't have eight minutes when I have\nUsed let's quickly get to it I've told you why I'm right tell me why don't guinea the different definitions of jurisdiction okay it says it sounds as they get angry I'll hang up on you stop it don't get angry is no reason to get angry when I met at each other let's talk about it and you tell me where I'm wrong you haven't done so yet\nI'm trying to pose suppose\nFrance decides to take in and and impose citizenship on any person who visit their country and then tries to say we're going to tax these people for their income that they aren't elsewhere\nAmerican visitors would be outraged you can't you can't impose your citizenship on us why because the United states would have an inherent sovereign right to keep the citizenship on its own citizens in pack and another country\nI don't disagree with we just I don't disagree with what you just had a child I and I agree with what you just said that has nothing to do with this but go ahead\nWhen a child is born\nUnder international law it retains the citizenship on its\nHands don't follow international you're all you have to have a minimum of international law we\nFollow the laws of our country you know that unless ... unless you've been through some world court that we have to adhere to we don't we don't believe in international law we believe in our law but go ahead I'm reading our law for even got\nWell there are a number of sovereign rights that have been established for centuries that pre existed the the constitution\nDoesn't matter our constitution and ... and ... let me ask you a global list do you believe in the international law you believe in the Hague being the the the almighty I don't\nThe Supreme if you look closely at the ...\nSo you don't want to answer when I just ask you are you a little ... you believe that uh hey I'm answering or a lawyer and you're gotta anger management issues rather you got to ... well I'm telling you were having a conversation and you keep on a ... ... ... I got to tell you I keep on asserting things and you're afraid to answer my questions you guys the hurting things how old are you\nStupid I mean honestly word I'm trying to have a really cool conversation with you you've gotten four minutes so far which is two minutes more\nThen I give most people most people get a man and a half two minutes I'm willing to have the argument with you then you go to international law then you go to France and when I tried to re bought anything you say you're getting mad do calmed down you have only got about another minute and a half\nUntil I have to go to break Williams make your point as to how I Am wrong without inciting international law in the Hague and friends tell me what I missing when it says persons born here\nAnd and or subject to the jurisdiction there up because as soon as the person's born here they're subject to the jurisdiction there up if they're born in my studio they're born in Texas they're born in the United states of America they are subject to the laws here I'm missing it but if you think\nStudio they're born in Texas they're born in the United states of America they are subject to the laws here I'm missing it but if you think I Am don't totally wrong about your interpretation you're wrong about what you're thinking and your thought processes that I don't care what your opinion is telling me factually why I'm wrong and I'll hear you got\nSubject to the jurisdiction there is so personal is an unnecessary language if you simply say born there has to be meaning attached to that phrase if you're born here boom that's it that's why I have that language\nThey allege requires you to do don't ask me a rhetorical question to answer you this actually was going for foreign dignitaries this was for if somebody is a Saudi ambassador and they're in the in the ... there in this country they're subject to their own jurisdiction they're not necessarily object\nOr law across the only word says that show me where it says that let's say you don't want to look at it don't mean word says that that's where that's where it\nThese children as are being born the second they're born they are subject\nTo our jurisdiction our laws or regulations we must change\nHow badly written this was I think there was an assumption by the forefathers and I wonder if you agree that we would all of course we wouldn't just give citizenship anybody who was born here but the way it's written in plain English suggest that they are\nWell as as I said it is an open legal question whether Congress has the authority Congress generally has what's called planetary authority over immigration matters which means blanket authority\nIt's an open question whether Congress could provide that the children of those born here illegally are not granted citizenship I support that approach I support a statute that does that now we passed a statute to do that it would\nAbsolutely and certainly be challenged in court and it's possible court would strike it down\nThat that is a good faith legal dispute that I expect ultimately to be resolved at the Supreme Court but but I ... I support whatever approach get the job done which which has to change the the under wise policy a birthright citizenship that just encourages illegal immigration Libya I\nA couple of months ago was that was at a detention facility\nOr down in Brownsville and and and there ... there were several\nInfants who had been born there because very correct that women had crossed over a illegally look it's not a good system to be encouraging women who are eight nine months pregnant to be doing a hard arduous journey with with human trafficker you know that that that's not a compassionate system\nAnd yet there were several infants who had just been bored or to two young women in in many cases teenagers who had just recently crossed over here legally\nAnd he's a Senator Ted Cruz running for reelection one week from today what what's interesting about this this reelection campaign that you put on there is a bit of a distance between you and and Robert Francis old Warren but\nThey're trying anything that I just had a guy on earlier this hour who whose organization put together a pamphlet showing where you stand on being pro life and where you stand on the the laws of immigration where you stand on on the economy in taxation and then on the other side they had were were ... and\nHe's with us the answers are those that Texans don't generally want somebody stole that entire painful if we did it to make you look bad and make him look good but even left the website the same underhanded stuff like this was happening in a lot of places people stealing your your yard signs of replacing them with ... science\nHow did you get through that garbage when you know that people are pushing so hard to to keep the truth from those who will go and vote\nWell you're right that there is a lot of anger and there's a lot of desperation on the far left and I and I think that they see that that the momentum in this race is is is headed in the right direction which is away from their extreme and radical a policy proposals and and and back to the common\nSense values that Texans have always believed in low taxes low regulations lots of jobs secure the border and defend the constitution\nAnd and I I've seen those same flier get mentioned provision America you know that that you've got these ... knock off Raj where ... where it clearly was somebody supporting data roar that was just producing fraudulent voter guy than and and so\nThey're always going to be unscrupulous when they try to lie to try to try to deceive at the end of the day we need to focus on the truth we need to focus on substance you know I'm right now in the middle of it\nTry to deceive at the end of the day\nWe need to focus on the truth we need to focus on substance\nYou know I'm right now in the middle of a bus tour with traveling the entire state of Texas barn storming the state we started the day and you ... we were in Del Rio we just arrived in San Angelo and I got to tell you where the impacts crowds yesterday\nWe ... we were down in the Rio Grande valley we had two thousand people come out in the Harlem with two thousand people come out and mission I mean there was an excitement\nAnd enthusiasm weighed over a thousand come out ... so I mean\nWe're seeing people energized and we just need to make sure that common sense conservatives that freedom loving Texans come out to the cold and what I Would say to your listeners as early vote come out in early ... if you haven't done it do it tomorrow do it today do it tomorrow but get it done and then then get your friends and family and neighbors did saying\nWell we I early voted today than it was easy it was a streamlined process we voted for you absolutely um but as we want your competitors at last we spoke you said it was thirty million dollars in his coffers I've seen numbers as high as eighty million dollars you hardly get this guy to cross the finish line that's that's almost disgusting because so much of it\nHas come from outside of our state how is it that you're maintaining a lead against that kind of financial backing\nWhile you're absolutely right it is massive massive money he has raised over Seventy million dollars altogether the thirty million was just last quarter and the third quarter erase thirty at night at one quarter ... north of Seventy altogether and they're lighting the state with cash\nA Hollywood liberals are all behind it by the way you got a lot of listeners in San Antonio let me get a great reason for any any person in San Antonio to vote for me which is if you saw at the Lakers spurs game LeBron\nJames showed up for the state or have we got an ... an MBA player [laughter]\nTrying to beat the spurs that's a great reason not to vote for a Democrat is catching up to Hollywood liberal\nBy the way he was in the L. Columbus night he lost the spurs twice in a week or do do the brawn James so so so that that goes a long way to it's Ted Cruz of course the Republican the great state of Texas\nRunning for reelection

thousand people ... who signed up for tickets\nEvery where we're going we're seeing real enthusiasm what's happened in the last two months has been the people of Texas are really focused on the issues and and my record\nVersus ... rocks record is is Knight and day I've led the fight for lower taxes lower regulations and we're saying record low unemployment we've got the lowest African American unemployment that it's ever been recorded we've got the lowest Hispanic unemployment that it's ever been recorded Texas is booming\nAnd Texans want to keep that them do and we also\nWant to secure the border ... works agenda his voting record supports higher taxes higher regulation\nKilling jobs especially in oil and gas which is devastating protects us and and supporting open borders I none of

and I haven't worked together on this that and the other I don't know if you hurt my interview with the with the senior senator to be honest\nBut his daughters used nursing back to health but he also

retired guy\nI'm not sure why they do is saying you know you certainly I've you know I've shaken hands across the aisle with people trying to get good legislation done protections but what about that when somebody on on the opposite side protections like he's got support from your side\n\nLook I mean ... campaign is trying to do everything they can do to see the voters of Texas so uh you know John Cornyn ... you know has been barn storm in the state with me on a bunch of rally side by side with me and he and I work together very closely ... you saw the debate in fact the fact that Joe the last debate we did in San Antonio you\nYou you hosted the rally after right were beta stood up\nAnd had the goal to say that people should elect him because he'll work with President Trump right\nI mean it's truly a laugh line I mean there needed to be recorded audio laughter this is a man\nWho is the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country was called for impeaching President Trump right as as far as I Know they do is never met Donald Trump if he has I'm not aware of it he just he just sits in the house and throws partisan a hand grenades\nAnd then claimed oh I can work with Republicans really had an accomplish\nNext anything in the house and in fact if you want to contrast my record with they does record\nHe and I were both elected to Congress on the exact same\nDay do ... how do people think that he's a newcomer and you're the old guy it was the same date wasn't it\nIt was the exact same day we both served six years in the United States Congress to one of the big differences is in those six years I have offered in past thirty four different pieces of legislation major victories for the people of Texas\nThey do in his time as better back venture I you know can can you recall a single thing he's talked about this entire campaign that he's accomplished I mean look I Know he did introduce legislation that he renamed the courthouse yeah but I mean he doesn't have a record of accomplishment what he has a record ...\nIs is is going to the extreme left he has a record\nOf up calling for teaching the president and talking about abolishing ice and praising NFL players for protesting the national anthem which by the way as why LeBron James and Hollywood celebrities are so excited with him because they because they\nThey support protesting during the national anthem was that's not Texas and and I got to tell you one of the reasons we had two thousand people in Harlem get a two thousand people in mission he is in Texas\nHispanics in Texas where a

I'm working on it I'm working on that if\nYou're doing much better so much better ... voice\nAll right let me go to the phone lines did not say hello to welcome to lie to read it has been so incredibly incredibly patient Brett I'm going to give you the time you need my friend what's going on well\nThank you I was calling about that fourteenth amendment issue short and had a couple of points out one I don't think that Trump believes he has the power and I disagree a little bit with Ted Cruz I think he was being a\nBaby just trying to didn't want to get into it with Trump I don't believe Trump thinks he has the power to do that I don't believe you are you use your starting the argument\nI think he's starting the argument I think he wants to look at the interpretation and I do think there's an argument there even even though I'm he may not win it\nBut I Do think looking at the implicit list of being born there having a jurisdiction and then using the conjunction and and then talking explicitly about jurisdiction could be an argument can be used but that was not the intent of the law and I think that's what they'll try I think they may lose but they will try\nWhat we say what we we were interesting to me is that when you read through what Howard had to say in the federalist papers they clearly says it wasn't intended for foreign dignitaries or aliens it says that but they didn't put it in the fourteenth amendment and this is my argument\nAbsolutely right the problem is they wrote it in plain English that's easy to understand\nAnd it doesn't say it in there they should have made it longer they should've included not of course not including foreign dignitaries and\nAnd ah and aliens and so on I mean I bet it would be spelled out it would be clear and not one person can be an anchor baby the problem is the way they wrote it was to ... they assumed that we would know what the intent was when that isn't the job of the founding document the founding document is meant to say these are the laws\nThese are the rights these are the restrictions on government this is the way it is and if that doesn't cover everything amen to me\nUm the liberals are the ones who actually want us to interpret and everything and make everything a living breathing document that's not what it is it's a chiseled in stone foundation and and I think I think you and I understand that William was mad at me you been on hold long time you heard that call he was mad at me because I ... used to not read the English I just read what he said\nWell I understand that I think too though that um when it was originally written it was it in in regards to the slaves I don't think of the time they were thinking in terms of babies being born here\nHad nothing down your athlete or a hundred percent right it was about slavery younger brother only\nAt some point someone came along because that's what lawyers do and interpret it that way and had it backed up well the possibility exists to reinterpret because it was once and interpretation and self\nThat it was you know you're you're right the Supreme Court interpret it it I think an Eighteen Ninety six Eighteen Ninety somewhere around there and yeah and they they're the ones that said yes this applies to anybody born here um yeah not not only do I want it to be reinterpreted I actually wanted\nTo be rewritten I Want it to be altered to say the original intent not including foreign dignitaries not including aliens not including fill in the blank make it clear because the founding documents should not be interpreted in my opinion it should be read and understood I I don't think that's asking much\nI don't think yeah I think you're absolutely correct yeah I think Trump that will bring that out by pushing that she's going to push it out there whether or not he wins I probably will is\nYou know but at least he's bringing it out and I'm good with that but when I only got one other quick\nPoint I think you'll like this is um I Do believe that will you be happy because we are if it does get reinterpreted we'll be right in line with France they did that Ninety two and did away with\nThe ss [laughter] well well thank God we we knew one of the laws are afraid to be our laws I guess are I'd appreciate your bread appreciate holding on see there is a nice conversation now live in I mean he went back and he pretty much\nHas the same exact stances William without getting all mad and frustrated in many got right to the point here is that they intended here's what it says here's what we have to do and and also you know the reason why President Trump brought it up I think he's probably right and I said this earlier\nThis president has shown the ability the unmitigated ability ability to to start a conversation in this country I don't care if you're on the left or hate him you're on the writing you love them or are you in between a you're not sure about\nHe can through one tweet or through one quick age or of a question in an interview\nSay something that will get us all talking and I think that's a good thing I don't know anybody in any side can say that's a bad thing that we're talking about the constitution and what the meaning of the fourteenth amendment is ... you know what I'm saying I think that's a good thing to\nBuy back to the phone lines is going to be ah let's see your line one's going to be rained on what's going on in Kansas rental high\nYeah are you doing living the dream eyebrows up\nThe fourteenth amendment I think ... is pretty plain and simple for me or not just solely for slaves I Believe if a woman coming here to the legal process it she happens to get pregnant along the way\nJust solely for their slaves I Believe if a woman coming here to the legal process is she happy as they get pregnant along the way and then all of a sudden she gets in and then as the baby a few months later debate it gets to stay that way I look at it\nWell I agree that maybe just to stay with us she came here legally or illegally I think she should leave the problem is and the reason why we have the issue that we have is chain migration and visitation I'm I'm a I'm a travel as Ted Cruz talked about\nWe need to get rid of chain migration the babies born here I agree it's a citizen because that's what the fourteenth amendment says to me the mother isn't it the mother is a citizen of wherever the hell she came from your baby on day you know no no I agree with you the baby can stay she's got to get out\nAnd and we start making that the deal just what they're not going to be coming here and having babies and leave their babies ear and by the way there is some rule that says you can't take your baby back with you to Honduras even if the babies the United states citizen I don't think so I'd never leave my baby behind I'd take it back with me\nYeah why even have the legal process law if people are able to just dumped their kicks off whenever they want you\nKnow I I wouldn't know listen I again the fourteenth amendment says what it says\nThe dare I say it carries should I say it and go ahead\nIt is what it is ... ... ... ... is what it is so I it is what it is and again I I Believe is clear several times over the years who said again for those of you are new to the show\n'em and those of you are going to try one should leave on 'em you come here illegally you drop a kid it that that is the the medical term right ... you know ...\nNow now\nDrop the kids slapped land and then there it is it's an American citizen congratulations\nBrave drop the kid where\nGo your ass back to Mexico I mean to me [laughter] that's the way it's got to be done to fail and and I and I smell it out I'll spell it out as simply as I possibly can\nYou come here you have the baby the babies are citizen you've got three choices but the baby up for adoption leave the baby was with somebody who's in the United states was a relative that easier legally or you take the child back with you the idea that you had the child here and it's now a citizen which again I agree there's fourteenth amendment says so\nBut then you get to stay and the dead just to come here from wherever and then the great parents get the gum and then the tea on the D a good to come and everybody else forget it dude\nNo you had the baby here three choices take the baby back with you which is the humane thing to do as a parent\nLeave the baby here up for adoption you never see again or do you have the baby to a relative of yours who's here in the United states legally\nWell they should and and the fact is you know Detroit coming back though in Detroit coming back and private investment and and again Gretchen Weber watch bigger government or more mandates that would and we're gonna have a Republican Senate and the and the Michigan Republican House we didn't want eight years in gridlock and that's what it was with a\nA you know what a grand home and that's why I work with a house Republicans the Senate Republicans and continue to drive Detroit forward\nAnd uh you know gets writes about a PET scan el edge and and uh and Gilbert a whole lot more people private investment or rebuilding that city and that's where we want for Michigan's future we don't want to go back and and that's the key thing is and then the question from Michigan is it as hey\nAre you a better off today than you were eight years ago you know an answer is yes and so let's not go back to the last decade\nHe's a candidate for ah for governor the great state of Michigan he's also the current attorney general Republican bill shooting a bill how close are you watching the uh betrayed\nUm I was going to see war is literally trade wars the the ... between Canada and and the United states specifically because\nMany people don't notice but Michigan voters Canada dairy is huge in Michigan Canada's bad ... been terrifying the dairy from Michigan to the tune of almost three hundred percent how close are you watching that because I Know that the other side I'm guessing your competitor feels this way has a problem with the with the president tried to even things out\nYou know what the president is trying to do is rebalance trading relationships and get a better deal kind of a better deal for Michigan end up and you know first he cut taxes for America and are Republicans in Congress in Michigan which means we're moving their production of the Rand truck from Mexico to Michigan now where I did that happen\nFrom Mexico to Michigan around and that happened before it's remarkable and now he's trying to rebalance trading relationships because because tags the or you\nKnow the manufacturing worker and and and Michigan was left out of this uh you know there's a global economy when the elite is a\nUh in New York and the west coast are enjoying themselves that we had tool and dye shops closing down and ... and people lose their jobs and so now\nA President Trump is it wants to rebalance relationships get a better deal\nAnd with respect to agriculture you know I got I received the endorsement than in Michigan Farm Bureau which is a huge uh have your cultural organization and and so on their guy and I'm going to be a hard working a governor for a a farmer's across the state of Michigan and I want to milk producers you get a better deal a fair deal\nI I Love that you brought up automotive ... and a dentist bill ... he's a ... the Republican who's the attorney general currently he wants to be your next governor of the great state of Michigan by the way I still have a house in Michigan so you'd be my governor to\nA woman in Atlanta what county ... county okay I won't ask for the address again\nIs that [laughter] well hopefully hopefully my taxes like hung on bill hopefully my ... well you will because\nI'm I'm going to eliminate the grand on whatever income tax increases on about jobs to take paycheck agenda and that's been a a a tax increase it was supposed to have been temporary as Ross Michigan families and small businesses are eight billion\nDollars and it was according to a fat and uh well uh we're going to the states that and get ... Michigan a big pay with\nNo absolutely and again you brought up automotive ... and I think a simple question has to be asked of the residents of the voters of Michigan do you think these planes would be coming back\nHad the corporate rate not been lowered these bonuses that went out to workers these increases and pay the went up to workers those are because of Republican or conservative values and the idea that if government gets out of the way business can flourish employees can flourish more people more jobs more stuff why is that lost on people bill\nWell you know it's part of this communication and I try to remind folks remember eight years ago Michigan was on the map where on life support\nAnd merge and seeing them we've rebounded of and now we've got to build on the success of the last eight years and go forward and the ... are there to draw a radically different or drastically different people\nI Want to take us for it and cut taxes and more auto insurance rates and and you Gretchen ... she wants to raise taxes\nWants a government run health care which will mean Dr bureaucrats or choose your doctor and how do you pay for a a government run government dominated healthcare by your taxes so she's ... she's in a Jack up your taxes you won't be able to choose your doctor or that's the road to the last decade part too\nCan't it's too risky it's too risky and that's why we're going to go forward with Bill shoot\nI Lived there full time when John angler was the governor and you're right he he won by very small margin but when he left there was a surplus\nIn the government taxes have been lowered he was talking about\nYou know having people drug tested before they get some sort of a social handout from the government he was actually looking out for our tax dollars are being taken out of our paychecks is that the kind of governor you want to be used while you're looking for a tax dollars make sure that we give a climate and the great state and the great lakes state of of more employment more business was coming back\nWhat you've got and I'm running for governor because I Want to Michigan to grow and this is about us being competitive and winning or again and beating the other states in America that I have a more growth and more people than we do uh I don't want Michigan and the smaller shrinking a less significant state we\nOnce had Nineteen members of Congress will have Thirteen and after the next census and that's it\nSmaller shrinking a blessing that against state we\nOnce had Nineteen members of Congress will have Thirteen after the next census well and that's a evidence that to\nOther states are growing faster than we are at our ex batch and uh you know that's not sustainable I Want Michigan and be a place where people are they call their home or not a vacation state of place they ... so we need to grow our economy\nGrow a population a and and improve our demographics shall we go forward that's that's what it's all about\nAnd that the reason people are leaving is ... it's not because it's not a beautiful state it's an amazing state but people are leaving because of the jobs left\nAnd whereas the jobs come back and they had been slowly but surely doing so and as you get more conservative policies from people like you I Believe they will come back one last question it's built Judy I'm S. C. H. U. E. T. T. he's running for governor\nOf the great state of Michigan he's the Republican he's also the attorney general right now and he's done an amazing job I talked to can pack that a lot about you and you've done an amazing job as the attorney general\n... the good guy go he is ready for Texas has for short or any general at Texas yeah\nI'm I I did before I let you go to the polls right now they're tightening you're right she's still up a little bit but it's within the margin of error in in in a lot of polls what do you do to pull this out you've got a week\n[noise] but you know what it's our message and it's all about how Michigan goes for the two big questions from Michigan you want to go forward or you want to go back and again that this specter and fear of the economic policies the extreme\nFar left policies is a a ... a scare people and as I say I've got your where every governor\nUh you're you're in danger of losing her job and then that the question also is a better off today than you were eight years ago answer is yes and so let's not go back and it's all about okay I'm Gretchen what will raise your taxes though she is going to cut your taxes that's pretty clear to me\nYeah I I couldn't agree more do we appreciate your we wish you the best uh let's talk again very sued and hopefully you can pull this thing out I'm feeling good about it\nUnless you were going to land a can be a nail biter um you know some or you know just like Trump won by ten thousand yeah that one by Seventeen thousand so they strap your on your seatbelt here we go or where to put a mix celebration and now we're going to win this thing\nHe's the aging of the great state of Michigan it's bill shooting running for governor he's the Republican go and vote for Bill we appreciate you\nGet thank you so much bags and I'm grateful that I talk to your show back after this and the Joe packed shows decorator [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy generic mattress built for everyone else you'll actually built asleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the interest of match your body type and sleep references to the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper\nLike a plush or affirmed bed which he looks there is no more guessing or confusion just go to ... dot com slash packs\nPigs are too many sleep quiz they're going to match you do a mattress do we'll give you the best leap of your life you'll excuse even split the mattress down in the middle providing individuals weren't needs and feel preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty\nAnd you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off all mattress orders get up to a hundred twenty five dollars off at ... dot com slash bags\nThat healing sleep dot com slash P.

I don't know this uh this county ... this part of the country\nAnd I mean I grew up surfing on the beaches here and a better I I went to high school here in ... and a college here have at work to Europe so what it is is that if the president is an issue but we've got an outsider in this district was trying to\nA game right to represent us a guy on the is legal part part I mean really\nYeah well there you know obviously in the ... year seat is a is quite a trophy if the Democrats\nCan defeat you a ... and Fifteen terms I you came in as a strong Reagan a conservative or libertarian leaning and are you now are in the fight with you know someone who's getting an enormous amount of outside money\nChallenging the entire world view of a Trump and conservatism as Orange County itself has seen an influx of a folks from Los Angeles and more liberal\nAnd the itself has seen an influx of a folks from Los Angeles and more liberal enclaves of the state of California uh so what do you say to my listeners a congressman or our backer about\nWhat California has done wrong that could end up transplanting itself across the United states extending across the United states\n[noise] well ... part of our on our big problem that are in California and of course uh it's it's now having a major impact or they say on our quality of life you have to look at things and and how pervasive this whole issue\nOf vision of having millions of of non citizens are coming here illegally and two hours into our society are right now our education system\nIs going as good as it gets the disaster for the education system but we have issues that people talk about like uh how about the homeless\nAnd when you take a look close looks at what that means is there are a lot of people out our state for example who are down in the White House the homeless people yes have drug and alcohol problems but there are probably half of the people were home those who are people who\nGo on the ... they lost their job or something and they can't find a housing that that they can afford that they that they have the money to be able to pay the rent that's because\nFor the last Fifteen Twenty years what's happened is all the political housing the low low priced housing that would be available like Craig house but it's clean and nice living it\nHas been taken up by people here illegally and they they'll be two or three families so here we have so much of our of our problems bill directly from the fact that the federal government isn't controlling the border\nAnd as I say here I think when people think about it I think historically if he just successful I Hope he will be this person with Don critical services and\nTurn around the country but I was doing it\nAnd I want to play than really quickly for this is from your a primary I think this is from the primary debate with Iraq current your your opponent Harley route to a less listen\nWhen do you support expanding expanding Medicaid for undocumented adults as well Mr ... yes and when I talk about Medicare for all or some of these other measures that provide some level of assistance to some groups are the answer would be for all residents of the United states of America\nOver Congress don't get much worse I'm Wendy Rogers Republican for Congress running against Tom allowances could be the deciding vote to put Democrats\nBack in charge of Congress their gender repeal the Trump tax cuts ... eyes open the border to stop the president's trained deal just dry the economy then impeach tromp impeached Kavanaugh and replace the rule of law with mob rule to Massey clumsy and\nThere are some collateral damage\nSome others who do not share our view while healthy it\nCollateral damage what does that mean that doesn't mean you lose your job your home and everything you've worked for my son of Democrats can push the radical agenda on America\nI'm Wendy Rogers I approve this message and urge you to ...

there's going to be a rally for Rick Scott and also think for moody um we've already for age ... or I'm not really sure average immature I'll look it up um but that said to be happening in Boynton Beach and high ridge road tomorrow salmon are going to go\nThey didn't put that in the amendment the amendment says what it says period end the story now\nI Know what the intent was Kennedy intent matter well not if you're a conservative\nAnd you look at this as the foundation that this is in stone what liberals do is they say yes I see the first amendment but his living and breathing and its movable and it's multiple and it's like play though I disagree either get says what it says\nWell the second amendment is mobile and we can make all sorts of laws restrict or access to guns and infringe your access in southern because mobile reasonable and that and it's play though I disagree I think it says what it\nSays I think that for all of the amendments so if it's poorly written fix it\nAnd it is poorly written they should not have left out the part that said obviously this does not include a team together would obviously this doesn't include foreign dignitaries this doesn't include um the children of illegal aliens they should have said\nThat had they said that\nThere wouldn't be an argument now what do I want I don't want there to be birthright citizenship\nI don't I Want birthright citizenship to not apply to people who are coming here illegally there should be a change to this amend the constitution change the fourteenth do a a a convention of the states where you have to do there are proper process sees in place to fix where they screwed up\nIt's that simple\nSo I Believe will you know I agree I Believe that most of us agree that I don't like the fact that somebody can break the law come here to drop a kid and the kid is a U.S citizen that should be fixed in changed it's interesting because on friday I Will have um oh have representative Ted Poe\nThat that should be fixed and changed it's interesting because on friday I'll have 'em all have representative Ted Poe who's a former judge and he sees where I'm coming from and actually agrees\nSheriff Clarke however disagrees\nWilliam disagreed although when you take all of it away carry the one thing that is constant here is that those of us who are having the discussion or a smart enough to have the discussion and B we truly agree that we don't want the children of illegal aliens to get citizenship because they're born here\nWe all agree on that\nThey're just mad at me because I won't agree with their take on it and this talk show host said that this legal scholars show the other there's nothing that is hard to understand about what I just said the words are the words I read them they make sense to me they're English we should fix it\nNow I Will take your phone calls but now now you know what my stances we'd probably agree on what we want the endgame to be\nWe just disagree on what the current wording of this constitutional amendment says we go to the phone lines and again if you wanna light up over how I react to William you're more than welcome to what am I going to I'm going to have you on the phone very long in the show is it about you know the\nLet's play the talk show host sucks and they want to go do that today oh let me go to Joe in Kansas City Joe what's going on high\nA gel taking my call you got to be in the I don't wanna like yeah but I Will say I think you're rude but I Would like that the argument let's go earlier I'm a lawyer and city okay so I Know yesterday that that you don't interpret law and you're going to Europe and in that do it\nNo no I Want to stop you because that will you made the mistake of saying that to by the way William got angry uh William was snappy William took six minutes but if you think that was rude I can appreciate that you feel that way having set it\nI didn't say we don't interpret laws of course we do I said ... amendment shouldn't be interpreted now I Know that you can make the argument that an amendment is the law but I'm telling you is the time it is not a law it's a directive to the government as to what they can do to us\nAs far as taking our rights away so I think there's a bit of a difference there if we're going to believe is conservatives that this is the foundation that's etched in stone to me it's not open to interpretation but go ahead I'm listening\nWell that's what the courts do what they interpret laws and writing a fishing okay so so it is that French reputation and and the fact that you said a moment ago that you think it was poorly written is would agree that it that it's and it's not clear\nNo no no no I don't think there's any big us at all I think that it says exactly what it says my problem is that the senator at the time Howard said exactly the way it should've been written this does not include dignitaries their children their families or\nAliens he actually said it it's written all over the place he never put it in the actual amendment I don't think that this is\nThis is an enigmatic at all I think this is very direct it says what it says and that's why I've got a problem with it that's why the interpretation which is what liberals do they interpret\nThe southerners written in stone and again I agree with you about laws against constitutional amendments are laws in my opinion they are on adults rented rights of the American people that can't be infringed upon or taken away by the government why we think we can screw around with him is strange to me there is an amendment process by which we can change things having said that\nIt says what it says I don't think it's in the U.S at all to you\nYou're a lawyer you read you read this doesn't see what it says or\nThings today that your original person and I'm an original person on the ocean like ... and they give us it's not so clear and the reason why it's not clear is because the word jurisdiction doesn't necessarily mean exactly as you are kind of characterizing it yesterday as meaning like if somebody's already or a studio\nThere under your jurisdiction that's not exactly how or does it mean then well\nYesterday as meaning like if somebody's already or studio ... they're under your jurisdiction that's not exactly how or does it mean well actually an example you just gave us perfect say is that the people here that are here illegally are not allergic to the jurisdiction there not right right and so their children are also not subject to the\nJury I disagree because once the child is that it's a different individual that person is in fact because the person broke the law to get here they're not falling or laws they're not under the jurisdiction that person should be sent back but if they drop a kid in the meantime what did the kid do\nThe kid is now if the kid is now in the journal under the jurisdiction look if the if the the mother had the baby the baby was in dire need would you give the baby care\nWhat yeah why why the economy or jurisdiction send them back to Mexico to send them back to ...\nTo care you know against the woman can\nAnd why and I I I understand that I'm asking you about the child because the woman clearly broke the law the child didn't do anything wrong the child had been born here and the fourteenth amendment says you know in our jurisdiction\nAnd therefore you're a citizen I don't know how that's in big us now the fact that you and I disagree doesn't make something and big us that's not the definition of ambiguous ambiguous means it's not showing the the the defined meaning\nThat was intended so it's not the fact that you and I see it differently I think you're smart I think you can read those words as well as I can and\nI actually think you agree with my interpretation but you don't want to\nI think that you want it to mean something different look door jurists down is used all the time by police agencies I Can't do that I don't have jurisdiction this is the FBI's jurisdiction it runs it it it's a matter of\nA community in which the laws should be followed and whether you have to follow them clearly the illegal alien didn't follow the laws they're not under our jurisdiction go back to where you came from oh you had a kid he hasn't done anything wrong with the kid is in our jurisdiction therefore this unfortunately\nBy its wording says that's a citizen I wanted to be changed joined thank you and I agree you really think that there shouldn't be changed\nOr actually here's what I Would say is is you know it's I'm not a judge and you're not a judge and ultimately a judge will determine this I think that what\nI've been suffering others with the court's going to I think you're right\nRight and actually I think that's what President Trump is doing because realistically it's the only person that's going to be able to get this on the front of a court would be President Trump and the reason is because nobody has standing\nWell how do I have a little older than I Want to stop you because as a lawyer what you just said is incorrect the president doesn't have standing\nThe president can't sue to get the fourteenth amendment change\nI mean you don't you're right you're right I mean he can't I mean he can do with Obama did but then again we'd be saying let's let ... let's let Trump do when we hated a liberal president doing Obama with his ... his phone went around Congress went around the the constitution constantly\nChange laws all the time and you and I both stood on the highest mountain in screamed and yelled about it but now we want this guy to do it I look I think President Trump doing a great job\nOut of the game to do anything view executive order now he can try and then maybe he'll be sued by the stage\nAnd then maybe you guys are part of the Supreme Court if that's what you meant in a roundabout way that\n... that's exactly correct because the fact is is right now nobody would have standing to question the law as it's currently interpret it\nNow I disagree I disagree with you I tell you why I think the California New Mexico Arizona and Texas do have standing because we and I'm In Texas we are are encouraging those major medical fees\nI mean nobody's nobody's going to a hospital in Laredo having a baby and paying the bill they're not paying the bill so clearly there is somebody harm to you you'd agree to that\nWell I Would however that type of stand and it's so much more difficult to get to go get the getting to court and so what's much more easy is that she denies the right to a newborn a of an illegal immigrant that\nYou get to getting to court and so what's much more easy is that she denies the right to a newborn a of an illegal immigrant that New Orleans directly have standing the question the law and then it's going to force the interpretation of the court\nAnd I'm going to tell you that it if it gets in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals are going to be as clear as I can with you and I think you sound smart I think you're gonna agree with me if it gets to the Ninth Circuit court of appeals and if it doesn't get to the Supreme Court which still may\nThe Ninth Circuit court is going to say you don't have standing to bring this case they're not going to put anything they're not gonna ruin even just going to throw it out and say he doesn't have standing you know that happens all the time\nWell it would be the child that would bring into the child would have standing and so the child in the New Orleans is who's going to bring this case right now nobody can bring this case because I Can't bring it to say either you know somebody only legally\nYou bring your case I mean it's probably be does the ... the executive order that's exactly\nThe ACLU would do a little like we're doing multiple do or you know everybody would line of\nHabit right right and and it would be thrown out because he doesn't have standing that's what I'm saying or know who wouldn't have any", "city": "Tucson"}
