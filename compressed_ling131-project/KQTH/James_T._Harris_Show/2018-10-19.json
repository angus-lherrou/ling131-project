answering it was so him oh yeah typical man pretty general them I mean ... it's a editing ... outcome carry you will please update us on the caravan heading this way for thousands strong and growing from Central America\nFrom Fox News hundreds of migrants who reportedly a broken away from the caravan moving through ... announce it to be at that country's border with Mexico just hours after President Trump issued a warning and he may ask for the military to get involved in officials there can't stop this onslaught migrant shelter intake Qunu mine on the Guatemalan side of the border report it Thursday\nAnd now it's gone\nWell that's what it does I'm hanging in the ... or ... intelligence the left his hand on tree out making your new stories ...\nMigrant shelter on the Guatemalan side of the border boarded today hundreds of Hondurans the caravan of about four thousand have already made it there and the rest of ... hours behind in Guatemala City as a caravan appear to be the first thing in some parts\nMigrants are hopping on buses and hitching rides instead of burning northward on foot but it's unclear whether those who've made it the farthest will try to enter Mexico immediately or wait for others so they can attempt to mass crossing\nVideo circulating on social media purportedly showed hundreds of migrants many wearing backpacks walking on foot and the Mexico Guatemala border town Mexico's already sent a simple east to the border to me the migrants\nAs that anyone would travel documents and the correct visa will be allowed to pass up the mothers and the group can apply for refugee status officials also cautioned that those who tried to cross into regular manner\nCould be detained and deported\nAnd now a showdown which according to Trump could become a matter for the U.S military Mexico can't stop the caravan in addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over the population I must and the strongest in terms of asking Mexico to stop this onslaught\nAnd if I'm able to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border Trump tweeted Thursday morning and translate a threat against the caravan which originated in Honduras in his bound for the U.S in the bed to escape pervasive poverty and violence comes the secretary of state Mike Pompeo has to Central America to discuss the issue\n[noise] so the the simple question is what to do\n... what would you do it in and I guess the secondary question could be who do you think is funding them and financing them I think the left or so is is so backward and so anti this country and our our traditional values I think they're so against any border whatsoever when you've got people like visual work I Do for some Texas\nSaying that we recently took half of Mexico um\nThere's no doubt in my mind that those on the left and far left or the ones who are supporting and promoting this you'll also look I have seen some interviews with the people that are in the care of him\nAnd they'd been translated I don't speak Spanish well enough to understand it as as people are speaking out as they go a break it down it's been a little bit but I'm seeing a translated people are saying uh or we want the American dream we want a better job we want a better life\nThat's what everybody wants that I get better I mean I understand that that makes sense but that's not a refugee that's somebody seeking refuge from sudden certain death\nFor their family for their wife and kids that somebody who should apply to do it legally that somebody who should apply to come here and be a productive member of the American society and we we enjoy people like that we want people like that we employ more people like that come here but when you were being interviewed and you're telling me that you're ... you're going to come here and you're going to request political asylum\nAnd the reason why you came here as for the American dream it a better job that's not the same thing you're not somebody who should get asylum you're not somebody who needs asylum you're somebody who's seeking refuge it's just like the late\nThe thing you're not somebody who should get asylum you're not somebody who needs asylum you're not somebody who seeking refuge it's just like the lady with the child the three year old that was the poster child it turns out she took her child away from her husband and our doors who's got a great job as a truck driver or something\n... there was no immediate needs you just want to do\nAnd it wasn't the first time that you've taken his children from him without them knowing that his approval so the idea that these are people in dire straits\nThese are people who need political asylum or they'll be killed for speaking you know their mind um there'll be killed for being a certain race or ethnicity or religion none of that's going on these are people who just want a better job\nAnd do it on down are spent my entire life trying to get a better job and expand what I Do I agree with them but I Want you to do it legally\nIn because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone who's down or losing you only try and\nSends out there is because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone who's down or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is winning for this country again and and they know that he's draining the swamp and they were terrified because the old way of life is over\nAnd they knew before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington DC well not going in and and voting on behalf of their constituents so it makes them scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's\nDoing this because he loves his country now as a whole anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before\nUm which is all the more reason that we need all the Republican support we can in Congress\n... really great to talk to your brother in law ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nOf woods you may be announcements I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do the ...\nRouge early jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for countries said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process when it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take the stuff\nHe actually that all of us down and said\nI Want to do that and then two days before the famous ... birthday during dinner and that\nYou guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rose um but but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew\nThat my father in law can do this job he's a businessman he is so smart when it comes to negotiating the one who has been able to do in in so many different respects what Tara with trade um he really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it\nUm it's so for me it was a hundred percent and\nAgain I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um it it's it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and different tack every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of planes in here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history of one of the greatest presidents and countries that are had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or husband his or her father in law is the president ... Mbeki twenty six teams of bitter she just said it was nowhere near I mean you expected that the media would come after the leopard come after you does but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would just to this extreme you're going to the media for a long time I've been to newsrooms for a long time as well just they lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this so what what was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be [noise]\nWhile I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because I Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that one\nThe new shows but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it was a very clear wine to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president ... but um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child I mean come on and so it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to became president that if he got in there\nThere was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their own way of life was going to come to an end do um I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you and you guys were you have the ... of any family you've ever seen in my wife is Lara Trump era 'cause her husband her father in law of course is the president of United States we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people go and vote\nIn Texas where I should go Ted Cruz the incumbent who's doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your father in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being challenged from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know these are far left wing socialist disco war you look at places like Michigan or W ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show the ... seat this really used gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the ... you can go vote I mean it's really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I speak to you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will be onto your day ironically and Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them to think about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted on by president and and really pushes agenda forward\nWe can see so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what they saw them look like look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda for rent it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that since shock everybody to a degree that you you not only are going to get out and vote in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nOn it it's very area and I know that it felt like a fight and twenty seem to get Donald Trump elected in certainly certainly was the fight isn't over you and you can't come back you can't relax we can't be complacent me have to get out and got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nDid run if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to them in their shoes are delicious lose his wife is from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting it is there I mean there are people waiting in line for foods and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in the country could as horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country\nOr tells you a quarters Beto O'Rourke you've got people who were actually saying there's got to go live in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nOr actually saying this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go lower last question I really appreciate your time and by the way I'm Glad you're in Minnesota we go for great stations there we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul and Katie okay they're hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying voters will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts you can take more of your money away at will drive jobs out of the country that's what they're running on and the fact is there almost fifty fifty right now in almost every poll you see\nWhat is it that we're doing wrong you and I ... I done junior the president of the Fox news sanity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that is crazy to me\nWell I don't know that it's really I mean we thought how accurate the Cold War and insurance and a great point I don't really think that if that out there I think there are people that are afraid to tell a pollster that call them coaching them on the street\nThat they want to vote Republican because the media and ... and dined such as a number on on people whenever they come out in support independence or as a Republican I'm thinking that make people when all that teen choice or support sometimes but when they get into voting\nWhenever no one else is walking when they think about the ... where we come in the country and almost elected in two years on your president Donald tramp Trump\nAnd they think about their children and the teacher that country I really think that they're going to vote Republican and I'm just a matter of getting people out and encouraging people to get out and vote falling here knocked or make phone calls how everybody you know to go about\nYou know I'm On the road from now until November that I have a Thirteen month old son believe me I Would live in the home hanging out with him but because of the hand and because I Want the teacher\nAnd being the best they can be perhaps I'm Down here doing that and they must important thing I can be doing\nAnd that's when beautiful baby congratulations on his birthday recently oh yeah I'm the pictures of look over on on a Instagram are amazing thanks so much lower for taking the time was talk again very soon can we\nOh I Would love that I think yeah\nIt is Lara Trump Eric is your husband and father in law's the president of United States we're back after this on the Joe Petro stay right here\n\n\n\nRelief factors are great all natural product that for about a dollar a day actually less than a dollar a day you can see if it will help you with your pain like it helped me with mine so many people will try to release factor and their stories are amazing it's a hundred per cent\nLeaking again the fact that you know hot water you fix that I tried okay I guess it's time to call for ...

I'm a logical gotten a rational guy if people are being arrested\nBecause they're not men and they're using man sized issues I'm On their side leave them alone and let them use the names\nAre absolutely yes ... and this is about how people feel it as it is it's a snowflake man out and it's a Great Britain writes in England yeah\nJohnny how cheerio rodeo we've received complaints about the size\nOf the changes that cute little chicken doo doo shot [laughter] they go out that it doesn't ... dog beer them to call them a little tricky new do so [laughter] I think that would be a writer you them yeah I Would actually buy an idea\nWhat should happen now listen and I've got a huge audience in England as you know and it said man or a mess yes in ... when you get off the law the in the fall and so and\nI urge those listening on watching it England right now to go down to the drugstore and demand some man sized issues because this is a stupid this company is if enough people asked Ford they'll probably be dumb enough to change it back to ... and that are really good views of\nTerrible\nFrom now on the show will be known as the Joe ... show men sized\n[laughter] ooh I'm going to do that I'm going to put in a way that you can usually will no actually it was and then my kid was sort of a show ... can I Can't listen what else is going to be gone like I said man which will probably be gone yeah and hungry maybe when you're on for men yeah the hungry and on\nBut what is it fair job I don't even know what that is\nSo as we see with many uh many leftist program but the group is promoting this has really engaging in double speak care their version of fair is not the version up there that you or I\nOr any of your listeners would think so because of course air to them and means free benefit I'm very high wages for wages up for jobs that would be food service jobs or just minimum wage job um they're calling for free transportation for workers I W come on live more than\nI offered camp on\nHealth care free health care\nFor all employees at all levels including undergraduate students who are working a few hours a week um they're calling for increased wages and they're also calling for\nA employees to be promoted within the university instead of university hiring managers from outside program but\nWhat I found really funny about this campaign was when I spoke to students on campus and said here's what the progressive student union is proposing how do you feel about as\nMany students didn't even think these concerns were relevant I talked to a student who works in our university library at George Washington and she said that her manager was a former uh employees student employees who had worked his way out and she also said that she got the rains every single year and make the high paying wage so\nIt made me wonder if these reforms were really not the theories or if they're progressive student you knew was just trying to tell the liberal party line of of promoting this idea of socialist\nAddress or understand what they're saying you have a I'll go to work and I'll do a job if you treat for me there if you pay me wondering worries and\nIf you promote people from only where are you so you can promote them even if there's a better candidate outside you have to know that person\nIs correct that's what they're advocating for 'em in the list of demands also includes unionization of all your employees and variety of other radical I'm a campaign\nAnd the list of demands also includes unionization of all your employees and variety of other radical I'm a campaign that they're promoting\nA hold your ears for a second because I think this is so bad\nOkay so I just I don't know how to get better is Abigail marine do follow her at ... over on Twitter also go readers story she was a great reporter at a chemical from Dutch ordered\nThe next one is ... is professor so senators do deserve your civility really so so what does that mean go beat them up on my phone that's what this on\nA senator you need that's what the teacher is saying I'm and essentially this professor university professor at Ole Miss tweeted that\nSenator don't deserve your ability at restaurants on and that in addition to harassing them and heckling in them and yelling at them you should get up in their faces and stick your hand in their food and take their feet away from that this is what this professor is advocating for and history\nAnd and and the tweet at actually is advocating for breaking the law that's what he's saying do is against the law disease and not smart enough to know that\nYou know it's not that I don't think he's smart enough to know that I'm sure he does know that but the question really is does he care and clearly he he does not have a problem with harassment of elected officials who he disagrees with\nBy the way that's all we happening to Republican senators would he be okay with that if I Do the to um to Dianne Feinstein would it be okay with you that the Cory Booker me busy\nI'm the I'm sure it's just because people you disagree with and you know I've had this conversation with college students on campus who are totally fine with the harassment a GOP senator as well that it's been happening in recent weeks and I've asked them\nWhy is this okay why is this violent okay why this harassment okay and their response is that\nThe Republican Party is trying to take away uh American civil liberties and then when I asked them what they mean by that they never have a good response they say something about Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court and when you follow up with any logic out well can you point out an example of how civil liberties are being taken away or how your rights are\nBeing taken away they don't know what to say because the only train of logic they can go to a liberal hockey point that the media has to be feeding them\nIt's a you're a great journalist so I'm not going to even pretend that I can give you a question to ask but if you run out of questions one day and you're talking one of these new fusses\nMaybe actually pose this question can you tell me what a civil liberty is and then shut up and let them answer you because they don't know they're just sick of the key word milk and\nFor so many students you I speak to on a daily basis civil liberties are things like ah they consider abortion to be there absolutely right and they don't even want to entertain the idea that there could be a different perspective on that that's a big concern on college campuses right now especially in the wake of the cabinet confirmations\nWell here's a great follow up to that asked them to show you abortion in the constitution and tell them that your weight or is that rivalry show me where is the constitution [laughter] I'm I'm happy to see it\nWell I I Would be happy about that but the problem is many of them don't care about the constitution bars\nYou know why are they talking about civil liberties you better believe it yet but they're connected to that [laughter]\nYou know I Know because the media doesn't connected for them and that's all they hear and that's all they repeat\nIt's a ... on Twitter she is a ... way correspond over ... or less loan you made a a University of Maine bars that professor who set up an entire cabinet D.C trip that this was a big story for about a half a second to the media and then ran away from it this is obviously a liberal professor who was what loading the buses\nSo this professor offered a free credit to students who got on a Boston would do talked to senator\nThe buses\nRight so this is professor offered free credit to students who died\nOn at Boston without talked to senator Collins out her D.C op and unfortunately the leadership and just you can't miss her ... reports on\nThe story all the time has one professor used their authority to promote their personal political pawns and even if you get extra credit or offer credit students but luckily the university caught wind up thanks are recording they\nStopped it right in its tracks and they said this is not allowed to happen and they are the professor from ever teaching again\nAnd I believe that private universities and colleges have have more leeway more rights than than a taxpayer subsidize university this was a University in Maine but it's paid for by every taxpayer where professor legitimately said I Will buy\nI Will buy you some credits if you if you will do do my building down and Susan Collins face basically we're saying do my political bidding I don't care where we get funded I don't care what what were they were subsidized by the taxpayers I Will allow you to have a free credit on the taxpayers dime if you go and do my political or persuading that's really what this person bit\n... and sign up for that trip it of course as a professor all that for one credit um there were different selection that students are required to fill out like are you require are you able or willing to be arrested and paper ... are you willing\nTo talk about your experiences with sexual assault on a a live stream or a large groups do it very clear that this professor wasn't just trying to bring a crowd to senator Collins opposite he was trying to cause an issue she wanted or would have been totally okay with um the students being arrested or\nTelling their stories to senator Collins ... you know achieve the goal of trying to get Brett Kavanaugh not impressed with the Supreme Court\nOh God I have gotten the credit had been a student there instead of going to go down and think calling for voting for them\nYou know I I somehow I doubt that I'll come on the trip or that you don't even want to go on to I think he's surrounded by people who think you're you're a bad person for supporting Brett Kavanaugh um but I don't think there was anything specific about that\nYeah I I I'll I'll bet a avid go we always appreciate the hard work from you and everybody over Cuba's reform cabbage reformed up or go there every day like I Do check out these incredible stories Dijon excellent journalists are doing a there'll be no the legacy

look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does rain if it's a great question um you know basically that generic ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points a CNN had a poll\nDays ago or ... or so that show that that why is that what you're seeing is that it almost all the polling that it's there now that said that the current trend that a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because their car and a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're calling a lot of people who aren't at work\nWhich don't tend to be Republican uh and as you get close election they got a better idea of actually going to vote wherever rabid mid term it's like you know roughly twenty five percent of the people vote so attorney actually going to vote is that's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll that has Democrats up three in the toss up\nDistricts now if you're only up three and a tossup districts that's within the margin of error and in the Trump total era I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call right\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had one that came out to be in the lobby the hotel\nI've noticed is clean story don't worry as you said um she said\nHey I I just want you to do I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad about the angry ... treatment of capping off I'm voting for the first time it it it it ... this is this this is the silent vote are not going to get picked up in these polls I think it's absolutely a dynamic that's Eighteen\nSimilar to how it was in two thousand sixteen there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own already\nYou know a Gallup poll came out and said fifty seven percent Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party is shifting\nYou know a Gallup poll came out and said fifty seven percent of Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party is shifting becoming much more radicalized and that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about that um you know the the the whole question about electing socialists\nPeople like Ocasio Cortez et cetera uh it's really waking a lot of people at a normal folks in the country just say hey baby out to vote\nYeah and I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from um NYU last night attacking a of a a statesman like Henry Kissinger he's Ninety five years old\nAnd when you see people you know quite mental that's what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to you in Florida Man I thought she was going accuse you of being a war crime and um you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people\nThat's a big turtles in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge journal tell me about the Trump effect he is he is dumping all over the country including in Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that live at ten pm on Fox\nUm what is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic better president would stand by a nominee like Kavanaugh end its historic that our president\nWould basically go all over the country is aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's national is I think in the era of Trump\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about Trump he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about trumpet Republicans who run from it because they don't like a portion of what he does or making a mistake\nOf voters know the difference that down so it was a one account guy they don't think that every Republican his truck they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are authenticity is on the rise in politics and that's a good thing\n... years is the reality the Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't compete and there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um\nWhat are your concerns though Matt should the Democrats wrest control of the house what will that look like\nWell they're gonna start persecuting people like my wife worked for Donald Trump they're going to go after every White House staffer they can they're going to try to bring people down to their age this whole idea of the mob mentality that take it over the Democratic party will turn to\nDabble in power in the house and it'll all be about trying to get air quotes corruption Trump corruption and everybody that associates themselves with Trump they're going to try the same strategy Hillary tried which Donald Trump his agenda is so obnoxious and toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it\nAnd it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our wits end already I Do not know what's gonna happen if the Democrats dispatch which they will have to choose because it's just that there is no which at the other than stopped Trump that is the agenda\nWhat it what does your got tell you Matt where does this and I'm actually I did I what do you think happens\nMy gut tells me that we're going to have a fantastic ... Senate I keep saying to be picked up in the Senate from fifty one degree I actually it could be higher than I actually think many of these races like clear McCain\nI think to be picked up in the Senate for ... do you want to I actually can be hard but I actually Mickey's racist like Claire McCaskill in Montana West Virginia which um answer I think the Democrats are totally vulnerable I think the Republicans have a great chance to pick up the I think in the house of the coin flip\nOn I think I think other can still having a chance to hold onto the house\nBut it's\n\nA tension you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lowered costs dramatically you may be significantly overpaying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings you may be able to save as much as forty percent\nDoes not permit order\nAnd promotes chaos that was at the heart of what he ran on so this cuts I think uh his way as these midterms heat up and they get they are very\nSo this cuts\nI think uh his way as these midterms heat up and they get they are very close now most of the polling still shows democratic victory in the house but there is a path\nFor the Republicans to hold the house it would be extraordinary very rare for president after his first you know middle of his first term they usually lose seats it just the natural political pendulum but\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you wanted to say about\nReasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters polo see Feinstein and Schumer I'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths\nAnd I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston on Monday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit and coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that is a swath of America\n... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves are all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia when we lived here frankly\nYou know there are parts of places you you you know I I ... you could go never see a black person never see Hispanic face in some of these restaurants\nThat it it ... northern Virginia for whatever reason it carbs up that way it it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided live separate lives not in New Orleans we are side by side we share a music we share food we enjoy each other's company drink together we have fun together Mardi Gras together um\nAnd you hear a lot when you're in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you\nI think there's a lot of the disgruntled men out there with not only the mob stuff but the tone\nAnd the lack of results from Democrats Democrats should have it seems to me come up with a governing agenda I don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look\nThe Trump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z they didn't do that they have no what are you going to do you're going to run against joblessness\nYou gonna run against high wages you're going to run against high benefits business is growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you what Kamala Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe called Trump's fever\nSo when Democrats are coming around who your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you once you've won and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of it Terry Alabama does that work for you and what do you focused on during these midterms\nExactly right I think it\nAlabama does that work for you and what are you focus on during these midterms\n... exactly right I think that Democrats are not all but they're evil\nYou look at what they can't I Can't do a brain Brett Kavanaugh if a judge right Kevin report what because they're you know what you're trying to control that they\nFall while I'm there and it's that great boat and we can go back that your state for a while and it [laughter]\nOh we lost you there I think we're losing your there Terry but I got a point and I think you know to to to too many the Supreme Court has become the holy of holidays you just almost a high church too to some on the left\nWhere they see that as the ultimate instrument of control and social change and deprived of it they feel they've somehow lost something that's era treatable so this was a major blow\nEven though a Brett Kavanaugh as it down the middle of the road straight down the middle jurists she's not a radical he's not he's not\nThe next battle is going to be the battle royale you want to see blood on the floor come to Washington for the next round of confirmation hearings when Ruth Bader Ginsburg gives up her seat\nAnd Trump appoints maybe a woman a conservative woman to that seat or more a a a rich restrictive jurists one who reads the law and interpret it appropriately\nAnd doesn't make it up if you get a let's say Amy Coney Barrett\nGod help us all I'm leaving I'm going back to New Orleans\nI mean it it it it will be what we saw from Kavanaugh will be a cheap warm up\nFor what awaits that nominee thanks for the call Terry or we're going to take it very quick break we'll be back in moments Laura Ingraham show continues what are you focused on this mid term and and\nDoes do these

I've asked for an interview with him for the past six seven years this is the top talk show in in San Antonio\nBy far in by the way it's also the top talks with a lot of your city too and I thank you very much for doing that I really do but Joaquin it would do him well to come on and take down the hill conservative you know entertainer the monkey on the radio me and he's been afraid to and every time we've ever called he's all yeah let's check his schedule get back with you never get back with us\nBut he's the guy that's out there impeach Trump hates Trump Russia collusion he's he's a guy who is a completely unhinged I don't know what it is he thinks he does for San Antonio that people have San Antonio he does a lot for the illegal aliens that are here in our city and he seems to think that's a priority and it's not\nUm the priority should be for the people of the district you know that he that he represents unfortunately there hasn't been a solid conservative to take him on in that district and because of being recognition they'll keep on winning\nBut he was on CNN I Believe this was yesterday and and if it was it was the day before I'm actually to show the video on the live stream into and I'll play the audio here but he's I don't know who the host is and that's I'm not denigrating her I never ever ever never watch CNN I don't know who these people are\nA hit list basically and this guy was on it he's basically alleging and let you hear it again he's basically alleging that the president or his son in law\nSanctioned is hit or something listening to it again I I Am not making any of this up this is how nuts\nThe left is\nI Know poppy that there's been a lot of discussion about this will be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies list\nTo the crown prince to NBS in Saudi Arabia and the friends then may have acted on that and one of the people that he took action again as Mr Kissinger getting kicked\nAnd they're not that we have I just find me fair for the or we do not have that reporting I'm not sure where you're getting\nThere hadn't been reporting to that effect there has been ... I've seen are reporting to that effect\nThere has been reporting I've seen reporting to that effect\n\nAre we asking too much for him to tell us where the reporting was\n\nEven those of you who vote for walking Castro or for who young Castro or for anybody on the left is acceptable to you\nAnd what bothers me is there is a fraction of people in might maybe a sizable fraction on the left that here's him say it and believes that Jared Kushner gave a hit list to the crown prince that the crown prince then acted on that's what your representative some of you\nWalking casual just said that and there was some of you that believe it\nOr by the long and short of it is that that needs to be investigated this entire they the entire time line of what happened up any sharing of American intelligence with the Saudis and how they may if\nWe'd dude I Want you to really consider what you just heard\nAll my misrepresenting when he just said no no no I mean each his own words\nPaul ... misrepresenting when he just said no no no\nI mean he's his own words I'm not putting one word in his mouth he just said something about Jared cushion or having a hit list giving it to the crown prince than the crown prince\nActing upon it and even I I Know that\nThe other thing I'm kidding in a puppy somebody is on CNN and looking at her I don't know her last name but this puppy person who clearly is on a network that leans very left so much so that walking Castro is not coward enough to stay away from there because he was afraid to come on my show I'm going to I Want to bill in truth\nHe clearly felt safe going there and thought he could say I've seen reporting there's been reporting well that having been said and then he blows\nIt off\nAs if what do you just said wasn't as disgusting as it was this is the American left now I'm going to say it again\nIf you go and capture belt in early voting starts in Texas Monday you go and cast your ballot for a walking Castro you're casting your ballot for somebody who has no fear of going on network television and saying something that disgusting I Want you to understand that\nNo fear of voting for a guy who says Russian collusion although no one has ever been proven not even close he has no fear of saying the guy should be a peach but won't say why\nJust like this video Rourke ... you have to understand this is what they do\nI Would ... I'll bet poppy what's her face here probably got in trouble for saying oh is that we haven't seen that reporting on betting there might be some people maybe the higher ups and see it in order to say that you probably shouldn't say that look let that wouldn't go\nThat summer for a bit that's a U.S representative who just made that discussing allegation\nEight eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com we go to the phone lines to see a loan walking I appreciate you waiting and a Frisbee front of me a lot of phone calls and say what's happening and it's going to be line three Christian Minnesota Hi Chris\n[laughter] Hey Joe I'm In the not so great state of Minnesota and I'm stuck\nNow I think it's a great state I just think that both politically speaking guys are a little bit backward\nNow while they are hey I just wanted to tell you that I got a call your I got a car you're wrong on your ah three three\nTopics there okay stupid ignorant and a believers rice I think stupid voters are the ones that vote just because they want to vote that way they have no clue of what they're voting for they have no clue idea of what the policies procedures and stuff they believe and they just vote because they felt like Democrats or the way to go\nIgnorant you hit on the head and believers you hit on the head but\nNo no I I think I think you've used actually describe ignorant because that's ignorant when you just vote for somebody and your ignorant of the facts that are available to you you know that's that I think that will you just said fits in to that point the stupid ones are the ones that actually are presented with the facts they look at him they say well that's that's a ...
