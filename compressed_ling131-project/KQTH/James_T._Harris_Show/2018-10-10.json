I Do not blame you man I Would have as well yes\nMatt but anyway I was sitting in a cafe this morning and divine Texas Halloran taco and four guys walked in there all day in her middle twenties and two of them were saying if ... character things we think he's Hispanic\nIs lot and that's all I got the talking a little bit and they rarely no\nUses panic is not and therefore I got the talk a little bit and they really know where the laughter is that they're used for guys were in their mid twenties Jordan or Marines rope and they said the Democratic party has walked by\nAnd talked and talked to me I'm a veteran and I said you know about forty five years ago I took oh defend their country in the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and right now that matched the\nIs the Democratic party\nWell it's interesting take ... and by the way I Do have my my big fat hit on billboards boy as can be pillow twelve years ago now ... and you woke up let me just say about your welcome ...\nUm\nYou always forget the domestic part when we talk about defending because usually just\nOrder these foreign and domestic I think there are domestic enemies\nThis is a\nA program that was developed a few years ago when we were talking about energy independence for America where we were just spending billions of dollars if you remember the time when we were sending billions of dollars\nTo the Mid East for oil because we didn't have enough and really were drunk on a or a demand for oil and we weren't producing it\nBased on the uh uh if you remember the drill baby drill a mantra their way of uh gotten out here and understood that America is the land the great natural resources and\nWe've got great petroleum natural gas resources we also have another uh good clean environmentally friendly a source and that's made from something our farmers and other farmers are really good at and that's growing corn and we can convert that into and the good clean energy how they in energy\nAnd at this level with the delta between a rising all price it just provides a balance where we're no longer held hostage\nTo uh all shippers internationally where we used to send just billions hundreds of billions of dollars are out of this country into the hands of Middle Eastern people who didn't much like the United states\nWhy someone would like to help subsidize farmers before I Want to build any more golden palaces in Saudi Arabia I mean without a doubt a but but I'm confused because at my gas station a Sunday there is a sign that says he eighty five I even have I was ... five\nBut in this article than reading and you and I talked about this a bit beforehand were talking about ... Fifteen ... which which that\nIs similar to side of this thing going there you know what we're talking about is mixing Fifteen Percent ethanol which is made from corn right in a process and then the blending that with petroleum fuel you either got eighty five percent gasoline or Fifteen Percent ethanol so it's really the uh both sides of the same coin\nOkay and and we find that ethanol is they were unable fuel like like the gas where he put it you've bought it burns cleaner that's why we liked it and again and it helps that farmers\nLess greenhouse gas emissions more energy independence for us to a U.S of the nation of America and a less or more consumer choice so it's all it's all good news for America and this will be beneficial for corn growers are egg market\nUse the secretary of agriculture right here in the U.S a very it's Sonny Perdue Europe they're pressing the flesh of these farmers every day\nYou're meeting ... up with these men and women these raids families are for generations have been doing this what is their outlook because I Know that when the terrorists in the trade issue started being talked about it and again you and I think already knew that the president was using it as leverage to get a better deal\nBut there was an interim time where it looked like farmers were going to suffer and their outlook immediately was hold on a second what are you guys doing here what is their outlook now what are you hearing from\nWell amazingly though Joe farmers have been very supportive of the president understanding he's\nTrying to get them a better long term deal they know that China is not late fair\nAnd they've not been reciprocal in their trade policy and they know the president's willing to stand up for them that's why they've been amazingly resilient and supportive of the president there surely it's ... rounds from economic thing for them and maybe some prices that terrorists have hurt\nBut are they understand that the president I think the president's validated in this trade with this latest Mexico Canada deal you know and then the course meal with South Korea talking with Japan they you they I think they've got confidence in whole and that's what farmers all waste\nThis deal with South Korea talking with Japan they you they I think they've got confidence and hope and that's what farmers always trade owners hope and optimism for the next crop and the next better price so I think there with the president they understand and I think he's validated is trading philosophy with this new deal\nI think a lot of Americans like be found it very interesting how fast the ... you said yes let's make a deal we've found it interesting how fast the Mexico said yell at me to go seek NAFTA Canada held out a little bit but they're also coming around are you surprised by how quickly the leverage of the possibility of terrorists\nIs working and how quickly these other countries are going All right you're right we've taken advantage of you for a long time which make it more balanced\nI don't know that can say I really understood that until the present demonstrated\nYou know the results of that you and I think again when he threatens auto tariffs on ... in Germany and France and others as well as Canada and they understand that they've been taking advantage of our huge upload consumer market here\nAnd certainly by U.S companies taking a jobs and plants and Mexico and then shipping them back over here they're free you know the president said no more so this is the kind of thing and he is recognize\nI probably was not an early recognize that I wanted to sell as much egg products as we could rise but also like most farmers understand that he's in it for the long term gain and they're going to be better off in the long term he's\nThe secretary of our department of agriculture here in the United states of America Sonny Perdue or as you know I've got stations across the land and we're on television too but Fifteen of my stations are in Texas and I'm based in Texas\nIn Texas there were these heated races for house and Senate where of both sides you're talking about our trade specially agriculture between Mexico and Texas and Mexico and the United states of America\nHow how involved are you in the trade negotiations with Mexico when it comes to agriculture between Texas New Mexico Arizona and California and our friend to the south\nWould you do you know that are us trade ambassador Rob Bob light has has the legal authority to negotiate the specific legal deal right USDA supports him and the things the agriculturally that on the table so we had the portfolio of agriculture\nAnd we have people from us did it right at the table with a U.S they are helping them to identify a where our lines of ah\nOf agreement disagreement are so we work very closely together and ... in touch with us on a routine and regular basis when we're doing these negotiations so he fought hard for the dairy access as you mentioned that Canada right and it's a big supporter of agriculture\nBut what's interesting is the people that are running on the left Democrats that are running for either the house with the Senate in Texas specifically are saying Trump is is hurting our ability to trade with Mexico he's hurting our our farmers he's hurting our agriculture how would you respond to that\nWill uh I Would ask them to read the paper from the last two weeks about the new\nUnited States and Mexican and Canadian ...\nIt's a U.S MCA and tell me what is not better than the original NAFTA agreement it's better all around and for those people you know when you're running for office in particularly in the minority party\nYou know you can just say anything it doesn't have to be true you can\nPersuade them to see it at any people as as well be deceived but the truth is this deal validates the presents a strategy of knew better deals and certainly the U. S. M. C. A. is a better deal and we had a NAFTA\nIt is a Sonny Perdue the secretary of agriculture from United States of America are great secretary of agriculture one last question is that the ... when the farm bill\nAnd then after it is a study for do the secretary of agriculture from United States of America are great secretary of agriculture or one last question the\nThe ... when the farm bill is talked about we say the farm bill ... what is what does that mean to the regular America and that is it on a on a tractor on a farm I mean is that something that we can look for prices will go up will go down our agricultural go to more people around the world which will benefit our deficit what is the farm bill mean to me\nWell the farm bill is a bill that has the policies of the safety net it has farm programs and they're much more than that as conservation\nMeasures and it has the Supplemental Nutrition program known as they stand right for\nMany people that's where most of the farm bill money goes into the people that don't have enough food and that's why the disagreement or putting people back to work in helping them to get out of a a life cycle of poverty is very critical of this president into a and the Congress\nAnd the farm bill can actually be less expensive well Americans actually do better\nThat's right that's the goal is to help people that are in a time of unemployment for eight point seven percent or more jobs out there than people looking for jobs or that we really don't have a lot of excuses about why we should allow people to stay on food stamps indefinitely if their job and going lacking out there\nHe's the secretary of the USDA it's sunny produced sunny thanks a million always appreciate it\nThank you always great to talk with you back\nAfter this and the Joe ... show stay right here\n[noise]\n[laughter] ...

story just didn't make any sense\nUm I think sincere makes sense I think saying that she I Believe that she believes something happened but the story about Brett Kavanaugh was not credible\nI I agree

you when I talked about this this had nothing to do\nWith concerns about women and their rights for issues are not abortion this has to do with one point\nFive million dollars of taxpayer money that goes into Democrat coffers every single day by the vehicle pants Planned Parenthood natural they're worried about well the Democrat Party is imploding you can't get Americans to vote for on their plan of importing all of their voters from foreign countries isn't going so well except in California\nAnd a couple of others sanctuary areas and so now\nThey do not want to lose at one point five million dollars a taxpayer money they get every day because they know the Democrat Party will fall off the cliff at that point and that's what they're facing and that's why they're so desperate\nOr that you're a hundred percent ... Regina loud and it's a mad politics keeping your sanity and we'll going crazy you're absolutely right um this was it about cabinet oh this was it about women this wasn't about Dr phil just want a better view that\nThis was about trying to stop\nWhat they fear will be\nA traditional look at the constitution by the bench that which is actually what we want we just want them to sit on the on the bench those knowing ... need to look at the constitution and decide on the cases before them is this legal as per this foundation\nThey want the foundation to either be destroyed or they want to be living breathing in movable um this is I think a lot to do about abortion as well which there is no abortion case up to the Supreme Court right now so that's also specious\nThis is really about politics this has never been about because I haven't heard of a word about Harvey Weinstein lately once the way we view I mean it's like ... just went away\nAnd then there's\nWhat are you worried about how we Weinstein way we once we leave you I mean it's like ... or you just want to work\nWell and then there's the whole Keith Ellison storage where yeah where we\nGet a job because you're so right and that's the one that you should have been brought up to the ocean was he was investigated by the DNC by the Democrats who say well just over to see here there's a woman who's going to push reform to them succeed with work arbitrator ... afterwards she says she did to her and this guy might be\nThe top cop in Minnesota should help you understand that\nWell yeah and there's a nine one one recording I mean there's tons of evidence and where are the screening pounding on doors wearing blood splattered shirt ridiculous people you know who are demanding\nThese survivor's the quote unquote ... where are they so this is it this is totally expose their hypocrisy and when I was in the west bank this week they were telling me\nThat uh you know their internal polling looks extremely good for the midterms nobody wants to get over confident but there's no question that have nothing has helped us in show if you look at the tactics when the twenty sixteen election you have to almost laugh\nIf it weren't so pathetically sat they didn't learn that identity politics doesn't work and then they've gone through this whole cabinet thing and they're not realizing that doesn't work and they're just going to turn their guns on the next\nPerson that you know of course it's Donald Trump all the time it was cabinet now I was the Jim Jordan last night blessed to be with congressman Jim Jordan of our Freedom Caucus says you know one of the good guys and um he's going to be nuts because if he if he has a fighting chance for speaker we do keep majorities\nUm when he he is elected speaker he's even thought to be a up for it then they will go hog wild over him as a coach they've already started attacking him as a you know it'll get worse it'll be fever pitch and here's what I Want your audience to understand their next\nYou know the moment the president calls you up on stage because maybe you started a successful business or something like that that's what they go after\nYou they have docked me they probably docks to Joe I'm getting horrible letters at my house now address my home address where I'm not even registered to vote I actually have an anonymous registration for exactly that reason they've given out my home address book and Cindy hateful things and the list goes on and I'm not an elected official\nIt's so expensive to me if I'm a public person I'm here to take abuse I guess like you are but you know our elected officials that we put their how\nDare they how dare they docs than and expose their families they speak for us there our voice in the electoral process and this is actually not just cycling free speech not just an attempt to undermine our entire constitution especially our bill of rights\nBut really an attempt I I'd have to say the anarchy\nAgree with you I think that it's directly that and I think that it would it be terrorism and they need to stop doing it but they're not going to start doing it if it's effective Berkeley does he just said to the doctor gene allowed no other reasonable just mad politics keep your sanity and it went on crazy worst question and I really are this is going to do with the your expertise or\n... would just topics

bickering and ... and dined Feinstein and and Coons him and his lawyer ... even though\nThey really over there he didn't they will just make a psychiatric or psychological trees in the minds of people who would I'm not going to vote in the mid term maybe they don't vote no\n[noise] oh well I think that's exactly right I I don't think there's any doubt about that in fact a new polling came out today and I'm a ... forgive my being remiss I Can't remember who the posts\nThe right I I don't think there's any doubt about that in fact a new polling came out today and I'm a firm ... forgive my being remiss I Can't remember who the pollster was but it is that exactly what it's spelled out exactly what you're saying that\n... Democrats even in the vast majority of Democrats did not approve of how the Democrats\nHandle cabinet independence in record numbers I leave the number fifty eight percent of independence did not approve of the way the Democrats handled cabin on of course Republican numbers were off the charts and so this is what they're dealing with it look you've got this guy comes at\nThree in this new law clerks Joe are all women one of them is a black American in the world to to try to paint this got they look ridiculous and they're losing boats and it's not working they better come up\nWith the campaign platform I had Democrats on my show today I Will not every day who tell me the same thing moderate civil normal Democrats who just happen to like the party of Kennedy\nAnd uh and maybe Clinton but they don't like that and they've been totally alienated and they are desperate to save their own party and ask for me\nAnd I believe you'd probably feel this way too even though there's a little bit ugly and seeing the Democrats actually lose the election I don't like the idea of total Democrat demise because the lower that party gets the left it strengthens the Republican Party I Believe in healthy competition I like a strong robust Democrat Party I don't want to beat him\nBut I wanted to see them because they're good we're good and we just one I don't want to beat him because there is this dumbing cut\nThat off until you can give it give it to be taken every competition but this was in a competitive this was somebody showing up and try to kill somebody's reputation you're dead writers from march ... well ... you don't ...\n[noise] yeah well I Hope they're happy with themselves because they are also running their own jobs in my case and if they're running their own audiences most all leftists propaganda media is completely desperate for ... losing audience every day while while networks like Newsmax that just presented\nFair and square we have Democrats on every day I Know you get both sides um you know we're winning\nAnd were rolling and financially and so there's going to have to stand by what they're going to insist on\nHere's their problems do you know that\nThey're big problem is that their funding all comes from the left coast you're right and and from and from a Washington DC inside the beltway and from Wall street\nAnd put their voters are actually somewhere out in the mid west in the south ... devoted that they need to pick up and they get it because they have to say about this leftist regrets it socialism to keep their funding\nBut their problem is the middle America voter will not spouse that so they have a real\nReal dilemma and I don't know how they're going to make it past the midterms unless they change something fast\n...

you're carrying it looks like a girl well I said\nBecause I had a dream four days before she gave birth I said she was going to be born on October ... a whole lot ... six she was born on October second I blew a third mhm the only person got closer was Alexis who said the ... or do that with later but\nI I had a dream that it was a girl after having thought it was a boy the whole time and I don't know that was why would I Dream that it was weird so I told her and said you did you had a dream I said well Rehman ... Rehman know at first but ...\nI could just tell from the way she was Karen just 'cause I you know ... when it's a boy usually it so that got straight it's like a parade right out front when it's a

just that little bit there James ... we we we each are born with a sex but we live in an invented gender hierarchy no it's not invented it all play the end of that\nWe are all I find that in there for a gender identity and therefore play [noise] and they fire is\nNo no no no no you're sex determines your gender its not invented by anybody one is a male one is a female I won't have I don't want to

is not alone I read another there is another state\nThat I just read about or that has done the same thing\nIs this is just breaking today but I look up might be Minnesota maybe I I I remember last week there was a similar story where another state was opening up the possibility of X A third gender option on a birth certificate\nBut see I think ... should be determinative of gender ... they should be filled up at a hospital not an option for parent on a birth certificate ... this is not optional\nYou know this is like how much did you away\nAt what time were you born and what is your sex these are facts determined by the birth of chill Minnesota non binary gender identification on driver's license approved by state okay and that was uh when was that just last week right last week\nAnd and so ... this is a there is a trend here now these are grown ups in the case of Minnesota on their driver's license saying I Am now identify as whatever okay you're an adult you can identify as whatever you'd like\nBut a baby at birth should they be allowed to the parents have the option\nOf redefining the sex of the child on the birth certificate okay Brent Pennsylvania you wanted to say what print\nYes I kept\nA rancher there go Hi just as good\nAs brand you I'm from New York pay what\nThe or gender identification I Want to know if I can identify as a rose Bush because I Am pretty do I still have to pay taxes\n[laughter] I don't know but uh ... be careful with that they might clip you and I'll take your thorns okay thank you for the call 'em let's go to Bob Bob or you're in Minnesota right\nYes\nNow your state just passed this law where people can define whatever sex they'd like on their driver's license so you're ... you're really in the middle of this experiment\nWell I I think the whole thing is is the the socialist the Democrats are are following Solomon skews eight roast radicalism and they're trying to remove God from the ...\n... and we'd like this country was built on God's ... of male female husband wife we let it happen and we wonder why this country's gone in the ...\nWell look the certainly the in the Bible and in in classic Christian belief or ... ... it is it is held that God created the male or female but let's put that aside for a moment\nThere is something called objective fact nature itself that corresponds with this idea so the notion that this is\nHierarchy invented anything it's a fact of life like there is a free and their eggs and there are sperm and they're all you know these are these are objective facts built into nature that religion and man have acknowledged and embraced\nBut when you when you try to redefine the thing at its origin\nThat is concerning my problem is people are looking away from reality from science from ... the the sex of the child itself and I'm not so sure we should give parents the right\nTo shift or bend the sex of their child or or not to find that at all on a birth certificate I think for the purposes of the state that's a bad idea\nThat has many many uh ramifications thanks for the call 'em let's go to Kay in Iowa you wanted to say what\nI think you've just said part of it what I Believe this is as the spirit of deception\nYeah I think it's spiritual deception and confusion because it just is the last man said kicked got out of everything so now it without the gender identity with all of a stab at least in the book of genesis you're right he made them male and female\nSo now let's try to change what God did so that's all part of another idol it's it's something that is against what God created and that's why we have this it's deception and confusion it's a spirit behind it just like everything else that's going on in our country people just becoming a hysterical and radical\nScreaming I heard ... say the other day it sounded like an insane asylum the same hollering that you would hear that would come out of an asylum we were in a bad place right now and I'm only

becomes one of the first in the state to receive non binary ex markers on\nBirth certificate and driver's license now did this person we're going to look at the story but I think what they did was go

York Yankees ... if you're a sports fan of baseball fan you're going to watch that game up by the way congratulations to Boston they'd be my Yankees last night or going to go to the uh the AFC us against the Houston Astros ghost rose look I I'm not hating on Boston\nBut I'm a Yankees guy and I'm definitely an actress ... play the national anthem at a national day of a few years ago so I'm pulling for them but I just really bad timing to put it on\nAnd I guess the featured artist the entire night was killed her swift who suddenly he was like a politician and I think that turns people off for me\nAnd this is from the rap ABCs and they set a new record low in TV ratings on Tuesday to spite Taylor Swift opening the show with a performance and closing it by collecting the evenings top award in Music Awards settled for a one point eight raining this year money don't Eighteen forty nine which is the demographic most attractive to advertisers\nAnd a two point four and two thousand Seventeen and special aired on a Sunday in November last year or two point four in ... the previous record lows that by the two thousand sixteen version\nAir than others can there about two thousand Seventeen and in ratings that one didn't do great either but it's Neal the returns were twenty five percent better than last night\nWhen the ABC special lackluster performance and be able to tie the Disney on broadcasting that in terms of primetime ratings averages\nCBS won an item I totaled viewers ABC settled for third anything with third in total viewers with six point five million American music awards the only show on its primetime schedule airing from eight to eleven PM\nI mean at some point football players singers dancers entertainers at all\nWho act you know whether it's the Academy Awards or the Golden Globes or or the Emmys uh at some point they're going to have to realize that we're just you're turning us off everything you do we just don't care anymore when you're going to get what was it a one point six yeah\nCome on do you think of the biggest stars on earth were on that show last night they got a one point somewhere between eight one point at one point eight mhm\nI forwarded last Thursday we had a two point oh I'm just going to say but it's always the entire show it was three hours away I think you are alleging that yeah it's ah he's only I edited nine four one paths ended eight nine four one Seventy four seven I Wonder are are you in the same boat as I'm In are you sick and tired of people that\nLook we did not give you this celebrity and again keep in mind the celebrity comes from our caring about you your career whether you're saying you dance you act whatever you do you play football whatever you do\nThe reason why you're making that kinda money the reason why you have that kind of career look I realize\nThat I have nice things in my life because people are listening to the show and people like what we do but you knew this was this show is that as advertised\nWhen you say why should we play football and then I tune in and you're protesting that actually it's um that changes the game when you say by my my song almost that record Paris old I Am parents that one I rather old yeah ... by\nMy record and running around around that go on a turntable [laughter] so um when I say by my song download my song come and see my movie watch my TV\nLet me to it in and then have you tell me your your personal politics that's in my opinion is a bait and switch\nSo I Wonder because again last night people oh Carty or somebody was trending and then there was a Lana somebody was trending and there was somebody else who was a as Ilya and I don't know if it was ... or if it was a zillion banks I think it was a zillion banks um because she's very good at printing\nBut I'm ... and it's always about uh what's her face was but who who's the one with the but\nI'm actually in the center of all I can picture I'm looking at her home alone as J. lo she got the money was Carty Nicki Minaj Nicki Minaj idea she's always trending I mean\nAnd then you go and see why all because of M. and m's wrap that he really tore down Trump and the no stop because now it's starting to make me realize that even though something is trending on\nTwitter it doesn't mean that it's that important to people and we we now have the proof to show that at one point eight\nAnd it was the top print on Twitter even while the Yankees Red Sox were playing think about that so Twitter is not really a digital town square Twitter is a digital town square for people who choose to be on Twitter\nLet that sink in we've got three hundred and twenty some odd million people in the United states\nWe live anywhere near that many people on Twitter in the United states nowhere near that\nIf every single person we're on Twitter and we really did all react\nTo what was the most important to us sorry lettuce somebody in a car to somebody and and and Mickey somebody would not have been trending not even a little bit it does it opens my eyes that's for sure and I'm Wondering if anyone listening actually took the time to watch the game as ... any reports of politics happening at the ...\nMm I think Taylor ... as she mentioned something by getting something let it go down and you know there are stupid\nInstagram thing yes she's supporting the Democrat over the Republican and she thinks she knows about Marsha Blackburn she really does I mean I read what you wrote she doesn't know anything mhm I'm ... did she always said going voter did she say vote be your\nVote I feel I I ... I think it was hey everybody go out and that\nOkay it is I ended a nine four one packages go to line one is going to be done Hi dom\nHey yo you might mad I listen every day but you know and I need to bust and you'll bring it most every show because you know you're crazy wacko and you know that makes my day\nYeah but done and have you had to listen to every day you can't listen when you feel like it I Would I mean\nOkay well it does start you know I I I I think about it you see that's why I like about your spontaneous and you speak she'll come the hit which is what I like about it and they run out of it that's the way I Am yeah\nI I'm into politics but not every day but I just wanted to mention how they how they how the uh Hollywood thing you're talking about him I was watching this last Sunday I I watched that Madam Secretary once in a lot I don't know if you've seen\nThat show because I figured it was about Hillary so I ignored it you know\nThat you know what the what she wasn't this last Sunday Hillary and Colin Powell metal out right there were all a guest appearances and the thing was that nuclear weapons or not the\nGreatest threat to the word but nationalism which makes people hate each other like them not like them is is that that and Henry says ... on them I've been telling you that for a long time and you know be aware of what's going on in our country\nIs how I'm going to stop you only Saudi Hillary actually said he was owed them or\nOut of many one should not be so hold on a second ... is one of the show that I'm clear on this she's the leader of the I've already met is dividing ahah she's the leader of the party that is filled with hate and she actually just said we should not be civil with each other and the words that came out of her mouth or even ...\nExactly what I said the Republicans take the clip you that in all of your ads were running running the election I Need is that coming out about it for for marketing\nDollars with you and I appreciate you as always out of Minnesota Jerry I I mean it doesn't really matter what side of the politics you're on mhm Hillary Clinton say purpose seems to be out of place a record from yesterday where she said don't be ...\nUh I Believe so yes yeah\nYeah she just said don't be civil Eric Holder today said Michelle Obama said when they go high we go low and holder said when they go high we go low they kick them while they're down yeah\nWe have the the known that the crypt the Soviet signals intelligence intercept that proves that yes lo and behold out this was a Soviet agent at the top about government so if you're surprised\nAt what the Democrats did the justice Kavanaugh over the last month don't be they get update done it before and not just Clarence Thomas they did it back in Nineteen forty eight with this great American hero Whittaker Chambers\nThat is the unknown mistake voice of Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies that's an unbelievable story because I ... and again I'm you and I talk about it all the time and you know that\nUm but but I Know a little less reactive fact [laughter] I\nI it's a I Know a little bit about history I pay attention I I Do a little dog and pony show every day I Would never ever have thought in my wildest dreams that the Democrats have been doing this\nFor Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago yeah they did exact rising ammo this ain't modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing or on the ... of the Supreme Court so you're saying this is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens\nWhen you make a deal with the devil\nWhen when the left decided that the ends that they're ... getting power\nJustifies the means this is what you end up doing was destroyed innocent man\nYou will try and you'll use every dirty trick in the book because as far as that can said\nIt doesn't matter what I Do to another human being because I have to have the power and that was so important I I couldn't put it in my book you know why we fight happened off they came out yeah but when the president stood up\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world\nI pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did that justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounced in is that that was a historic moment because just as wicket chambers was innocent Seventy years ago so is justice Kavanaugh eight year old man who the Democrats tried to destroy\nThe name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies go get five copies giving to your friends and family inside Dr Sebastian Gorka that I Am yeah I\nI read the audio book this time so the whole book in order for me with my funny acts that\nIt's not funny at all and that that that's going to sell a billion copies everybody wants to hear you read the book so go and get that as well get the audio book as well so so let me ask you about this ... this whole idea from the left that that you so well say actually talk to my\nMy friend did go ... about this as well he goes back even further even before World War one and World War two to wear this sort of fascism has\nBeen known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen\nThat way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why but but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving you this justice Kevin decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because of the right always gives in and\nPull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I I'm ... I'm a strange one why\nBecause I refused I just refuse flat out from day one to talk to the the fake news I I I didn't know whether it was what's the post Diehl lines and I said no why would I tool to people who wish to destroy this press that I'm ready to go on record her off wreck or the trouble is\nThe majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh hearing the majority of their status when the G O P Senate is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House they want the joke they won the approval\nOf the New York times why they want the approval of CNN this is the problem and you know why that is so ridiculous number one they wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years and secondly who cares about CNN yeah the you know I I\nYou know how many people watch the most quote unquote important show on\nCNN every night and listen to what I have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it like he is the ... my colleague at all it's yes he is the king millions and millions and millions of us to every show\nAnderson Cooper the star of the Clinton used that work Monday Night his show gets six hundred thousand view is\nAnd that somehow they're showing record Dr Gorka how how is it that people and you're right people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what Anderson Cooper will say about them\nRight when we have three hundred and twenty five million people in this country on less than half a percent what's what's Anderson Cooper if they were paying thanks to ... and we now they we now do they pay if they were paying the CNN to be broadcast in America's airports\nYeah that'd be three people including some who are watching this show it is is what we have to break the ...\nThe approval of these people but I Know what last friday did you watch the press conference by the Republican senators\nIdeas you it really it was actually in power yeah\nThey were angry I have never seen them so angry at the Democrats will that disgusting behavior so you know what I think something's changed but everybody be\nDeadly serious the midterms are\nThe most important election of our lives don't take it for granted go to vote take your friends to vote if you like the last two years and he wants six more we have to win the mid ...\nHe is Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies one last quick question I always appreciate the access in the friendship thank you and they'll show and I said oh we're friends as well I'm a welder when it comes to left versus right politics I just saw an article by the hill that says that millennials overwhelmingly\nAre liberal leaning left will vote left I also saw another recent polling I forget who the pollster was but it's a real one that says that suddenly the G. O. B. S. even things up for the race or the for the house of representatives\nHow do you balance that zero fear in your mind as there is a little bit in mind that these young people will go and vote like drones for the left they don't know why they're doing they lean left um and that will somehow counterbalance those of us who actually have studied these things that are more middle age or a little older\nThat will go ... go to the polls to how how do you counter balance that you have a fear of what's going to happen in the house\nLook I I'm a happy warrior like Reagan I Am an optimist I\nThink we can we can we can take or we can keep the house keep the Senate the millennials are problem if you look at the victims of communism foundation they did a poll that said forty two percent of millennials want us to live in a social\nNoticed that they didn't know what\nIt is but but but you know there's two reasons not for a number one\n... a lot of millennials just don't vote ... this is amazing garden you chew called Austin flatus he goes by the name of like us on ... ... E C C C a s what's HIS Video he goes to the rally she goes to the you know dumb Trump rallies and he goes to the camera and the interviews these millennials\nAnd he asked them you know all these amazing questions and then he says so did you vote and sixteen and they always say no they don't vote they'll they'll\nGo out in ... city yeah they well they don't vote for some reason so I'm not too worried about that and also I'm optimistic because look what happened in sixteen look what the polls told us Hillary Ninety three percent shoe in\nNew York post I saved the tweet Ninety five percent ...\nIt makes me laugh every time how stupid they worry about the other thing\nThat I think ... now we're going to see even more people who don't admit it public\nThey've seen your four O. one K. increased by ... percent yeah if you're unemployed Robin and we'll go out of your basement because he's got a job [laughter] we got to vote for that vote for the people who ... who wants to\nBan ice the people don't want to tax more what is the Democrat message bring back ISIS though I'm confident but don't take anything for granted going to vote and say your friends and your family to vote\nIt's Dr Sebastian Gorka his brand new book just out yesterday why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies doctor I Hope that you sell a billion up and takes a million\n[laughter] back your by God bless you on the listeners\nWere back after this and the Joe packed shows the writer\nFor [noise]\nThe early ...
