purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments that Quicken Loans we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nOr to um be on the verge of defeating the ... in combat but we still have a week to go he joins us now uh it's good to have you on Mr Morsi how are you\nI'm doing great Laura thanks for having me on your program today\nAbsolutely a let's talk about the effort to blame this president his rhetoric his language for this horrific attack on the synagogue\n[noise] well I I think this is just another example of what we've been seeing all fall you have a resistance obstruction impeachment caucus that's\nBasically on Capitol Hill and the house and in the Senate and you have Hillary Clinton who says she's in capable of civility you have all these radicals\nThat they're only goal is to bring this president down and they're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president\nWho has done so much to restore American credibility aboard if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and actually had\nThe guts to go and follow through to make Jerusalem the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge but\nThey will find any way to pick at President Trump\nFortunately in West Virginia President Trump has a lot of support he won the election by forty two points\nWhen I get elected I'm going to be a conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda\nAnd separately the reason why people are fleeing from Joe ...\nIs he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWhy um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance in the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why the action is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast to let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and some price of Hillary and Obama but ... is not pro life a mansion supports Planned Parenthood\nMansions supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst\nThings of all is that Joe mansion doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe Manchin and the more people learn about his actual record\nNot his rhetoric because for what he does is he says one thing in West Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion they move away from them so it's an education process\nWhat about the um issues of just basic fairness that we saw a rise after the\nKavanaugh I'm hearing Joe Manchin a voted for cabin on the end but a man\nThat I think most people just saw that as just an example of rank unfairness and treating some time treating someone who is it 'cause he says you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion\nThey were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know the Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first called on the Senate floor mansion took a powder and\nIn fact he only came back the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia should cast a vote there should be the leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe Manchin could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nKavanaugh we know that Feinstein held that material for months why\nBecause she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided enough that it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they used that's what the problem is a guy like Joe mansion you know he may appear to be more moderate and rhetoric but in reality when\nYou're first vote is to empower these radicals then you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing the liberal and more and more voters are learning that\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia the president decided early on that he was going to try to do what he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life\nOr and yet he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw it but just today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] yeah I think many people realize that the president has really followed through on his promises to the people West Virginia let's start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition to defeat Obama's coal killing rights\nAt the U.S Supreme Court but that that is served as a bridge to President Trump and then he fall through on his promises which were on some of those crazy unlawful rules and that's putting some miners backdoor now look we have a long way to go\nBut you're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump presidency but it goes beyond that\nThe Trump tax cuts are very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling of the standard deduction and the lowering the rates but in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities always which are going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that's huge and that's\nCredit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he\nKind of goes back and forth and say well he was open than he wasn't the reality is he voted no he voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for it and that's not the kind of leadership ... but we are seeing\nA resurgence in West Virginia and you have to give this president credit for so many of the good things he's done on taxes on regulatory relief on picking rule of law judges that instills confidence in the system which allows\nA entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nOr we are going to be covering this race very closely over the next to seven days election day next week but you can vote early in West Virginia correct\nYes in fact ah October twenty fourth or early voting began swing hours people to go out to the polls if you need to learn about your early voting location go to Patrick or she dot com or vote that GOP and they'll take it to the right place\nA fantastic uh Patrick Morrisey again and the latest poll he's up by a couple of points against incumbent Joe

I'm a fan of I just can't watch these people anymore because they aren't entertaining Baron fundamental makes you laugh I don't get your Waverly they only Jimmy Fallon does uh last time I saw him anyway but I remember him apologizing for messing up the president's hair and I found that to be weird\nI found that to be odd so all of these people protected by guns including members of Congress and governors and mayors there are all out there talking smack as they're protected by good guys with guns\nSo I'm yet to hear a real solution from somebody in the lead look if you're on the left you have a solution and listen to\n... I'll say it again what I've said many times rock Obama in my lifetime was the worst president he may be the worst president in modern times Jimmy Carter is a close second Jimmy Carter who by the way still injecting herself in in uh in in news and in issues\nThere were bronco bomber was a horrible president\nRuined the economy divided us and the lines of race doesn't like how we got here hated colonialism\nJust complain does if slavery ended yesterday not a hundred and fifty years ago very strange what he did he did it with a smile and he did it is very cool it's like a rock stars that people found all over him and just didn't even pay any attention when he was doing he was a horrendous president\nBut I agreed with him when he was right I agree with him several times three or four times get bin Laden I agree with him kill bin Laden I Can't see it like if the if this president was the one that found bin Laden that he killed him\nTrust me or give you order to kill them trust me the left would say it was a horrible thing how dare he hates Muslims I'm telling you that's what they would do but when rock Obama did it I said well listen that was the right call call you had to make absolutely\nWhen rock Obama said let's cap CEO pay five hundred thousand dollars if you borrowed money for the taxpayers I agreed with him pay the tax payers\nBack first then pay your CEO whatever you want to pay him but if you borrow money from me you're not gonna give this guy ten million a year what are you stupid I agreed with him I thought that was smart I agreed with him when he said take out the pirates off the coast of Somalia that border American vessel I agreed with him\nAnd it's okay\nYou know you can agree with people that you generally speaking politically aligned with you can agree with them when they're right when rock Obama said marriage as between one man and one woman as he was running for president two thousand they agreed with him\nI did totally so listen and\nThat's all about a blind squirrel finding a nut I mean that's that's about him really taking the rights stance on a few different issues the rest of the time he was a radical that was trying to change the country from the inside out because he hated how we were founded\nSo when this president does the right thing like there's not a whole lot about blacks it today you know a black suit is Carrie\nYeah I've heard of that that yeah you're right and see anything in the news and that and\nMuch of black people went to the White House young black conservatives went to the White House to show that they are not going to be on the Democrat plantation anymore it's getting very little if any coverage in the news it was getting any coverage the coverage is a paddle a black folks complaining about how stupid they the other folks were for going to the White House\nThat's weird Alison camera on CNN when she was on Fox she wasn't this person knowing CNN she is actually asked um somebody from I guess the person who runs the synagogue the president's talking about possibly coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue which you welcome\nHim carry why would you ask that question would you welcome him and has not being a question I Would ask a little bit loaded no I mean you're looking for an answer their ... and his answer was absolutely he's my president why wouldn't they wanted to come here and ...\nA little bit loaded no I mean you're looking for any answer their ... and his answer was absolutely he's my president why would not want him to come here and that was the right answer but she expected he might say no he should stay away\nWell listen if even if you're on the far left and you're a Democrat who happens to be Jewish you know this presidents looked up for Israel you know this president has a history of working very well with and loving Jews so pretending like eat something other than that is stupid\nIt's just dumb he's the only president out of twelve and a promise that who really moved our embassy to Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel\nGet Allison Kim around a thought that the rabbi at that synagogue would not want this guy at the synagogue\nBack so weird it's become now just asking that question tells me she's probably a member of the fake news media do own or do I want any harm to happen to her absolutely not do I want her to be called out for badly doing the job or purposely misleading sure we can do that went up\nSo the whole idea that you must know seize on this crisis says ... said never let a serious crisis go to waste you should seize on this crisis they make it all about Trump negative negative negative negative it was Trump\nLecture let's ignore that walk away that big get together happened in Washington is that the widely reported the walk away march ... there are a lot of people there Brennan struck was the guy but we had on here use the the founder of that of that whole movement and they had a great turnout not being covered by anybody\nSo is there fake news media you damn skippy when you ignore those things those positive things when you downplay the great economic numbers\nAnd then you get mad when somebody calls you up for missed reporting or being stupid get over yourself\nBut I really do want to hear some commonsense logical solutions to how we keep people safe for these soft targets and if the
