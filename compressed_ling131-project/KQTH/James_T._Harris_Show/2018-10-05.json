protesting Donald Trump no matter what the again but they're right or just out from them but I\nI was gonna say that you know when he now then Gorsuch delighted mentioned is going on at all you know when it's going to like ...\nRight [noise] I always talk I talked to a corner and about that specifically why didn't this happened with Gorsuch why is it happening now I think I Know why but we have the senior senator from the great state of Texas talk about that\nBut at the same time look protests to probably go to the White House every day outside the gate protests Trump's ... trumpet stupid orange whatever that you can do that I mean it's stupid but you can do it and you can also protest even if you're ignorant and dumb\nBut at least tell the people that you want\nAmy Schumer Emily whatever her face and Chris Evans and mark Russell low and share and you know now it's ... and John Legend and Whoopi Goldberg are all protesting now either today or tomorrow um at least say what it is you're protesting I don't know what it is they're protesting because originally the protest against Kavanaugh was\nI'm Betty what he's going to overturn roe v Wade in a woman's right to choose will\nBe gone or ... who's a man to say how a woman should this then yeah but now it's a stupid argument land\nYeah because they know and then I got up that was ever going to happen\nThere's nothing to back it up but at least there was on issues at least there was on something we we liked\nThat abortions available we don't want abortion to go away we don't want a a a woman's right to choose to be infringed and so on and so forth a constitutional right to have an abortion by the way there is no constitutional right to have an abortion show me abortion in the constitution to give you a million dollars\nAll right so Kerry right now it's looking for abortion and gossiping [laughter] now I'm In a ... million dollar um but\nThey have the right at least it's an issue that I can say okay I understand why they want this to happen I don't know why it's it's this guy Kavanaugh he hasn't said that he's against\nRoe v way to that he would try to overturn roe v Wade there is no case of roe v way but I at least I understand the argument\nReally argument winter well we're not gonna stop 'em on that let's stop him on all of this he tried to rape or a girl a Fifteen year old when he was Seventeen and Nineteen eighty something\nNo cooperation do anything they couldn't stop him on his actual record they couldn't stop and Monrovia Wade they couldn't stop him on soft money or by the way the left as a problem with soft money unless it's coming from ... so they couldn't stop him there\nAnd they sent out there that we couldn't stop him on on the alleged rape either because he's not a rapist I'm\nWell look at every responded do recall them a rapist in front of his wife and kids and he responded with a with an angry tone or the sarcastic tongue that needs to be on the court\nExactly right doesn't have the temperament now so big last than ever return so we know what's really happened we know the truth of the issues up till now simple question what is Amy Schumer or what our Amy Schumer and Emily Saturday him again below ...\nOkay or Eli Rogers calcium and er and er what's your face Emily ... Schumer a jar legit and ... and Whoopi Goldberg soon we'll be doing is that\nWhat is it that they are protesting if they say no rape is on the court carry I agree with them mhm wants that right now they say do abusers on the court I agree so what are they\n... who wants that right nobody said do abusers on the court I agree so what are they protested\nWell according to ride to count is good yeah she\nWrote and I guess as of today today was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination Brett Kavanaugh a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault\nSo she she's protesting the fact that he's been accused of somebody who's been completely exonerated on by the FBI right in seven deep profiles of his background\nYou realize what he was with George W. Bush he literally had ... posted a nuclear weapon you right now he literally had him\n\nThis this woman Roger ... she's protesting the fact that the leftist said that he assaulted people and the FBI is no completely cleared him a good way for him to go to court that's what she's protesting and that's what you got arrested over\nThey were denied that opportunity but we thought it was more important to get a question\nQuestions to a doctor for it in a way that was respectful got the information we needed and I think what it shows is as you suggest as an orchestrated effort not only to defeat this nomination but to a bunch of ruining\nIt Senator John Cornyn the great state of Texas Sen Cory ... book or yesterday actually said these words it doesn't matter anymore if he's guilty or innocent John is that where we are in America is that really aren't\nThat that is no that is to me that as an American I'm I think uh I've I've\nI've uh had a little cough off for too with the senator Booker I told him I said that a look a Corey I I can hate the sin but love the center but I think he's just been ridiculous in this process\nNot only the I Am Spartacus moment but saying he was intentionally going to\nViolate the rules of the Judiciary Committee and make confidential documents public because he didn't agree with it right unfortunately I think this is the kind of what he and others who are running for president twenty twenty or responding to is this sort of unhinged anger not only at the Trump Administration\nBut um that are making our politics so polarizing\nIt is a Senator John going to Republican the great state of Texas of course in the Senate Judiciary committee that that just passed Kavanaugh onto the full Senate for a vote there was some sort of a hesitation by by Senator Jeff\nFlake which was another odd moment that not withstanding it looks like he's probably going to be confirmed that what about his family does anybody care about this guy's family who's got a beautiful wife and daughter is he's got an exemplary record in the community he goes to church every Sunday to ease\nThe coach of the girl soccer team I don't think you could you could have written a movie script with a better candidate for the Supreme Court but now for ever some people who are indoctrinated on the far left senator Bayh believe this guy's a serial rapist somehow how did you get his reputation back how does this family get through this\nWell it's it's really it's just a it's unacceptable and uh and it just really violates every fundamental notion of fairness we have in this country when people are accused of things like this uh know presumption of guilt in fact the presumption of innocence due process rights to a a fair\nFair hearing and so um I think he is a thankfully are willing to endure this terrible process despite the pain\nOr that it's caused the unfairness to him and his family because I think he realizes that if he were to withdraw that this stain caused by these allegations would following the rest of his life and so I'm proud of him\nFor being willing to up to fight back there is some now suggesting I guess because of run out of other arguments that his self defense at the second the hearing shows that lack of judicial temperament but I I think it was a display of righteous anger\nThe way that he's been mistreated and the way Dr ... been mistreated by by uh by the process\nI thought that was very very smart and very sympathetic view earlier and you've said this consistently that the left\nActually took advantage of Dr Ford how do you want to take anonymous Dianne Feinstein the ranking member on that committee\nPurposely settled in this letter for almost two months somebody leak didn't only few people had it including Deborah cats\nA far left resistance lawyer that somehow was on a lousy forge team um they leak that they somehow got this out there what should Feinstein have done in your opinion or maybe maybe not even commenting on her if you say you get that same letter John what do you do with it\nWell Brett Kavanaugh's since Nineteen Ninety three has been through um a seven background investigations by the FBI so they've\nSince Nineteen Ninety three has been through um a seven background investigation ... by the FBI so they've talked to a hundred and fifty witnesses to determine what his fitness and his background are right ah for this job\nAnd what should have happened is when this letter was gotten\nIt should have been sent to the FBI so they could pursue it in addition the Judiciary Committee professional staff ... bipartisan basis could've question doctor for in our home in California and not subject to her to the circus process something she didn't consent to something she said she did not want\nBut as a result of uh her being referred\n... Senator Feinstein too I'm Deborah cats uh I think she was being used as part of this process to she was never told about the alternative\nOf an interview in in private she was a um she was forced basically into this uh three ring circus that she did not want to be a part of I think that was unfair to her\nAnd you're just a great point aimed and use the follow up on it when you've got somebody who's in her ear like again there's video out they're not making ... Denver cat she said we'll resist\nAt all costs we will resist that this is right after Jeff Sessions was confirmed we're going to resist we're not done we're gonna resist all costs ... John ... think that this this whole thing just ... buffalo\nHas been about abortion it's been about just resistance in general to anything Donald Trump does ... is there something specific ... that you and your private moments of thought to yourself I see why they did it it didn't work but I see why they did it\nJoe I think this is about power uh I think it's ah not much more complicated than that and uh willingness to do anything\nUh to ruin anybody to assassinate their reputation in a character in order to acquire it they were hoping to defeat this nomination to hold it open until the mid term ... she has been the next presidential election right and have a little bit foreigner Cory Booker or\nUm somebody like that er nominate to fill ... vacancy because they view the Supreme Court as the holy grail\nOf uh the American government and the the ... the source of power\nThat uh they are willing to do anything to to grasp\n... Senator John Cornyn Republican the great state of Texas is enrolled you knew this ... on sixteen stations now in Texas so we're getting even more taxes to hear you speak ... I'm ... I've I've got to ask you about the mid term because that's the obvious next thing I Know that you'll get a minute or so but let me ask you this\nDo you think like I Do that this has actually backfired on the Democrats and here's why I say that in states like North Dakota suddenly the incumbent he was down by twelve points the Democrat is and the Republican he's likely to take that Senate seat it's starting to look like the Senate might add a few Republicans instead of losing some\nDo you see that as a as a byproduct that isn't that isn't what you wanted I wanted to better like confirmation hearing ... the mechanism as well but that could be the byproduct no\nI Do think we're seeing a backlash against these are these tactics and something that that says um you know most most Americans when they see it and uh so I Do think this is gonna energize\nAre conservatives and Republicans to turn out the vote in the mid terms that's always been the challenge because we know the left um the anti Trump crowd is highly motivated highly energize so I think this is actually going to help us pick up some Senate seats\nAre one last question if not ... love your comment on it I've said for the very beginning of this window ... the left was pushing for the FBI investigation and flake however these women got him on an elevator that you have security around it I don't know they must have been invited by somebody uh but when ... does what he did and ... I'm going ... vote with this ... that I Need this investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive a little and save a lot since you know sitting sales tax on colossal Kaye wrote about one or the ... the two Seventy nine or visit them at ... dot com western hospitality with friendly prices\nAre you looking for a new gun the road runner locking said carried liberty can save the number one gun safe in America liberty had a wide variety of things to choose from and when you visit the show and that road runner lock and said you'll see why more people buying liberty gotten paid\nLiberty they've had a lifetime warranty matched in the industry out than they\nAre on sale at rather than a lot of faith located at five thousand one easy way boulevard or visit them online at ... dot com\nWant to watch you have to be boring which is why Joe bags as making radio exciting again more Joe packs next on one by one K.

way we're crashing into a story there were ... by paying for it\nI Know him on them\nBut let's be real about this the guy emailed me right yeah if you can email me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah she she responded in a uh probably about an hour and a half later she responded in email I'm with a blog site attached to at the time I didn't know about this blog sites are so so long story short she she says I don't have time\nTo respond to your comment but yet wrote publicly what three thousand word response on a blog who wants to me um you know addressing me as a you know the potentially you know ... ... what's that called the Daily Caller she called the daily fairer\nBaylor and you know she she is seemingly attacked my character and my reputation on this blog on you know and then proceeded to attach my contact information to the blog which I found to be\nA you know extremely extremely unprofessional\n... that's a a practice that's known as DACA so many people watching don't understand what that means so she publicly on this three thousand word blog instead of responding to you directly as a journalist 'cause that's who you are I'm and she also she let people know who you are where you want her to get a hold of you basically we're sticking to the left on you\nAbsolutely and I think Eric Trump had a perfect response to it as a ... and a power player in this town he\nSaid look this isn't so much a ... you know a person issued isn't Democrats versus Republicans this is a lady that is insane violence\nAmong sitting members of our Congress I think no matter if you're a liberal no matter if you're a socialist what have you I think you know condemning violence is something that we should all doing stand together and doing air Trump said it best he said look you know I'm a big Georgetown supporter but this clearly cross the line um many people are speaking out many people are frustrated and I do hope that Georgetown takes the correct actions\nIs ... ... so he was a great correspondent over from a Kibbutz reform dot org um this\nI mean people are frustrated and I do hope that ... the correct actions\nIt is ... so he was a great correspondent over from a campus reform dot org I'm this Christine ... is professor of fair thing is is not so we're going to do with Twitter didn't a second but I'm One would expect at Georgetown would say look\nShe's somebody who is in our employees were going to reassess because there is obviously something going on we don't support what you said we do it but they didn't say anything about what they actually said was and of course we were wrong they said well that was her private thoughts on her personal Twitter has nothing to do with us\nAbsolutely yeah that's exactly what she said and then also today a you know fresh off the news press if you will in the newsroom campus reform you know we got wind of a student that basically came out and said look\nI was in her class and had to drop is due to the brand that political bias in her spouting off um and yet Georgetown has yet to respond or you know to those specific allegations you know I I Believe this to be a complete abuse of power um you know we had a professor that is you know\nAbusing her power and saying you know you have to believe what I Believe I Believe is extremely uncalled for and we would think that at a top tier research style institutions like Georgetown\nWe would see some type of you know curtailing on this or or or some type of you know making what is right here because they do pay so much in tuition writer\nOr so so I find that to be extremely unfortunate for the students I Do attend the university I Do what I did have a friend that attendant Georgetown University and they were telling me\nThat they just want to stay away they just want to stay away and I I Do I Do I Do a you know myself after being attacked I'm you know and Abigail quite viciously a you know I I see it first hand\nIt says that group or a truce though we're talking about Christine fair she's a professor at Georgetown University and I use the word professor loosely um of course ... great corresponded from campus reform Kibbutz reform dot org go there every morning I'm long let's get into a Twitter did now because Jack\n... recently Jack Dorsey went recently to Congress and he claimed that yes we lean left but we\nPurposely or unbiased on the actual platform that isn't true I'm I'm shuttled banned all the time I I can tell when I Am because one person sees us you know tweet that I put out where I Know fifty nine thousand people would love to read it so that's ... that's not true they have immunity from liability\nUm does Facebooking does Twitter because they promised to be unbiased\nAnd they're not when it came to Christine fair she was verified I'm ... and nothing happened to her for the first twenty four forty eight hours than people like you and me and Eric Trump and others are started re tweeting and asking jak directly what are you doing\nAbout this this person who is actually say I'm inciting violence kill these people feed their genitals to swine what are you doing about it so then they suspended her account\nBut they let her back on very soon thereafter without them or vacation badge than this has been good it again and now from what I can tell she's back up is that really is that the long and short of it with her ... now you know on a short\nOf it or Twitter or to cancer and formed a a spokesman to Twitter actually told campus or one that they made an initial mistake on first suspending her on Twitter we haven't yet figured out why she was sick\nOr we haven't exactly figured out why she was suspended the second time um but in my opinion look\nThis is clear incitement to violence I think it's quite hypocritical and it's almost a double standard that Twitter has jumped on that to to unfortunate look\nA you know ideas you know for all the free speech let's make it their free speech let's not make it you know the type of pick and choose what ... what we politically you know identify with high Twitter I think Twitter has a long road ahead of them out to critique mistake and I hope that they do\nI'm with you it's that group a truce or greater a correspondent over from campus reform done or let's go to University of Texas at Austin just up the road from where I'm sitting right now where I guess the\nAnd would be a jak group a truce or greater our correspondent over from campus reformed up or let's go to University of Texas at Austin just up the road from where I'm sitting right now where I guess the young Republicans dared say support Kavanaugh confirm Kavanaugh ... students respond about\nWell they were simply having a peaceful protest a you know supporting that of judge Brett Kavanaugh I Would think\nYou know this would be a mere gathering of people are changing ideas but no the Latin get again turn to violence which we see too often the corresponding here in Washington DC now I see people marching you know and and and protesting which is important but yet it turns to violence left as we turned violent or attacking people an airport and I think\nI Know actually that a majority of the uh I'm Mitch McConnell said it perfectly said it perfectly on the board I think that we are not going to stand down to this left his idea of you know violence and all cause that attacking people and restaurant runs at attacking people airport this\n... on college campuses is exactly where this type of idea of attacking people of violent protests as coming from\nAnd I mean if I were and they weren't physically assaulting these these students I was watching that they were taking their science ripping them there in front of them are sheltering them getting their faces screaming at some point to get them back to not okay\nThat's not the first amendment was made for the whole right do you know to protest debris redress or the government doesn't have to do would you go to somebody on campus was a a varying opinion from yours in shutting 'em down that's not what it's about these kibosh is should be out front teaching that\nIt was absolutely horrible you saw these left wing agitator really really really get into space of this pro Kavanaugh supporters and and rip up their sized quake viciously and uh you know I I was just shocked as I watched the video to be quite honest because here we had these groups of students that were expressing your ideas and these ideas that\nAre commonplace the United states believe it or not you know people support Brett Kavanaugh people support the concert or I get a job that he believes then um you know it may not think that you know some some of these allegations but what it doesn't mean is that sexual assault isn't important but I think that there is this this misconstrued ID on college campuses\nFurther more college campuses due process what administration and left wing agitator have set on college campuses in light of this big thing is\nDue process what is that now that doesn't matter right and I think we see that not only on college campuses but\nWe see it in our country on Russia has been thrown out the window\nOr be Cory Booker actually said that I I gotta go jak a great reporting by you and by Abigail and by everybody gives reformed ordered keep up the

Anthony List what are you seeing\nAll week I can just to absolutely agree with what everyone else is that we have knocked over four hundred thousand doors and Indiana\nAnd overwhelmingly we have support here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the adage thing innocent before proven\nThat you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged in America we believe in the bill of rights and the constitution\nAnd that means that you are innocent until you're proven guilty and not the opposite way and that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man has been utterly destroyed without any proof and it's changed their mind\nYou know you you see a lot of that and and I think um the ... again I think the American people at their core are fair\nBeyond ideology beyond anything else they're fair minded people and had these allegations panned out had a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of this but the unrelenting salt on this guy\nIn the face of no evidence at all\nI think that his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the you're the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be me tomorrow we're going to be right back copy very quickly just want to ask you this the polls are tightening\nOf between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you were there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this\nTo the polls for ...\nWell I I Hope so I mean it's all of that turnout is those who are concerned about having a his support have announced you've got to get out there in the turnout\nWell I I Hope so and it it's all of that turnout at those who are concerned about cabinet is part of an ... you got to get out there in the turnout will matter I think with Sally can win so we all have to pull together\nAll right we believe that their latest please stay with us we're going to take a quick break them we'll get to all your calls eight five five forty ... the ... show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady of course incremental tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news ... said\n\n\nOh wait three hundred and twenty nine pounds I was a heart attack happened I got and before it makes me not so hungry I started noticing more energy they're noticed my belly we're starting to shrink started seeing we come off\nI myself and the mother of two children my daughter is Fifteen and I wonder if means so that you're saying you're worried about your daughter will not be able to what I worry that my daughter is getting a message from Congress that her experiences that her\nYeah you're worried about your daughter will not be able to what\nI worry that my daughter is getting a message from Congress in her experiences that her safety is not important but is it about abortion so you're wearing your daughter or not going to get an I'm also worried that my daughter will not have the right to control her okay okay I just I just wanted to we're talking about things that I'm worried about\nYour reaction to that Jody Smith the of the Susan B.

people remember that\nAnd one of the the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is mothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position\nYou know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family [noise] so it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and an upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about um women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed to be full and be proven guilty so that's\nWhy I Love Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel ... that they didn't have a real strong feeling about bread coming on the same way the president said a ... up until we can go I didn't know he was\nBut watching this play out watching the dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport\nAnd a man's reputation his family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what at all costs\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down a political opponent at any cost with no evidence and shame destroy use reputation for all time\nIn public and even force of all of a woman who's going through some sort of distress into the open to be used as you a political weapon that I think is is\nThe Americans look at that and go man this concerns me ginger I Want to ask you um you you have a big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between ...\nGinger I Want to ask you um you you have a a big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between Stacey Abrams in and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points do you believe female conservatives are going to a rally there in that Governor ...\nYes I did and I think that having a hearing it's going to really play into that because it's making when I\nWas really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman\nBut Brian count as a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I had thing just in the last week or so across this date\nPeople are more motivated than ever now to get out get out and that and not only that but volunteer that I was at the camp campaign the other day people were coming in to get yard signs and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and\nHow we see this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist playing dirty and people don't want to see this\nThey really are discouraged\nYeah no I I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs and confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think is what propelled Trump into office and it was that kind of well he called the silent majority\nI'm my sense is it's just working Americans\nAnd Americans would not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the working there working they privately have their views about politics that they express over the dinner table or to their families ... occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over\nAnd ... today in Washington I have to tell you I've seen friendship shattered people simply you don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today it's slash smashing destroy\nAnd I don't think Americans but particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we're seeing them in the streets but moms wives\nWorking women ... I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through everybody again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia\nAre your thoughts on where we might be headed here in these midterms\n[laughter] I think that uh due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote\nA for Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda and I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for cable because West Virginia's county there's fifty five of them\nAnd all fifty five went for Trump in the election\nSo that meant and twenty six states that made that we'd had Democrat votes as well and I believe that the Democrats also\nAnd the election so that ... that means that we'd had Democrat votes as well\nAnd I believe that the Democrats also are or we're going to get out and vote for Republicans this time so I think that the everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's my last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for a military we need we need you in December so kangaroo maybe\nMy last breath I'm so busy\nWell you keep going great to talk to you know junior high our last word do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia in the Republican Party in Georgia or given to ... years and we're seeing given the cabin all fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will end up in the midterms\nI ... I think it is energizing new voters more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about mid term because a lot of times people don't get excited about the midterms I think we're going to see where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red way is going to come and people are\nSick and tired of being bullied around and they are going to stand up for their freedom so we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to be shot shock and awe is what I predict\n... a Judy Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans were really bad at telling their story I always critique them to this they they can't tell a story to save their lives\nIn this instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how will this play the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are are are engaged in as they project themselves on the cabinet and his family and what they've been through\n[noise] well I agree with what the other gal said in Indiana we love our country we were first on the board for Trump remember that Mike Pence's as loved in Indiana and we are here to say that we support\nU.S Supreme court justice that supports the constitution or the United states living breathing document and for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator\nThat will actually be the incumbent because he is an outsider because his conservative and because he will stand for the values that Hoosiers believe and\nSo we believe that we also are going to see a red wave red sooner army in our state of voters that come out that never have before justice we saw during the Trump race where people voted for the very first time in their lives\nDrive a little and save a lot that you know suddenly sales tax on colossal Kaye wrote about one or the next two Seventy nine or visit them at ... dot com western hospitality with friendly prices\nAre you looking for a new gun safe road runner locking said carry liberty gun said the number one gun safe in America liberty had a wide variety of things to choose from and when you visit the show and that road runner lock and said you don't see why more people buying liberty gotten the\nLiberty they had a lifetime warranty matched in the industry Ogden faith\nAre on sale at riveter locking they located at five thousand one easy way boulevard or visit them online at ... dot com\nGroup of America were clogged traffic and whether they're honest that during his sons morning new juice on the news and talk ...
