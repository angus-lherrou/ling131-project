on this program so that he moved here as a legal resident alien that's okay there's nothing wrong with that and then you get legal status should get a permanent residency in but you work on your citizenship\nBut somebody who is an alien to this country that is not a negative term necessarily have you with the word illegal in front of it it is it means that you are an alien in this country you came here illegally it's just a proper term it's it's definable\nBut they're not illegal aliens here they are however illegal aliens and Mexico if they want to call themselves of Mexico is called the

well dumb as good an interesting to see if he does that already the national guard is going down there but if they're not on they're not going to help anything and they're going to be overrun so I mean are you going to be interesting to see if he does in fact call it an invasion force if he does he has every right to to by himself\nWithout any help them from Congress or protecting our borders so it'll be interesting to see if he does that you're going to say listen I already said that I wasn't so sure about that parity I got to do with two minutes left before the beginning of the show I

hard\nFor the listeners can go to see because it'll thinking about my thirties\nYeah I mean how ...\nHow did that happen I'm assuming they were listening to the pond caster ...\nMost of them over the Web site now and I mean one website you can go and listen to the parity is now a and the interviews are there and so on so he could have been going there or maybe I should without a warning on the top of the website ... weren't before sleep yeah yeah\nMaybe it'd be nice let me go back at it and say hello to a line three is going to be Joel in Alaska Hi Joel what's going on\nHey Joe hey get called her up here starting to rain a lot of big time Republican since that President Trump came up to bat cool or back in high school I said we've got to have a businessman running that country and that's it yeah\nSo he's the first person that voted for my whole life and the president while Evan it's awesome is doing everything is great but the care of it that we can't refuse to accept the fact that we're about to having a crisis down there but people get hurt or something we need to build a tent city for a\n... page at a jeweler pilots but for the richest city it was something that is that's a labor force maybe they could build the wall for us\nYeah in Maricopa County when Jordan was the sheriff there he would arrest them make them wear pink outfits and put them up in a tent city in the in the desert [noise] um I I don't see why we have to cuddle him\nWhen somebody is Lee illegally coming here the breaking the law and they're trying to basically steal from the American people why would you welcome them with open arms and give them all the benefits of of wrongdoing it doesn't make sense I\nSaid I Would say we got close that border for sure\n... you know you and I agree yeah we we agree that I think that that would Joe Arpaio solution was a Maricopa County was the right one I appreciate you Joe\nWe got close that border for sure no I don't you and I agree yeah we we agree but I think that that would Joe Arpaio solution was a Maricopa County was the right one I appreciate you Joel open light now a ... at eight eighty nine for one pack Joe ... dot com will continue to go back to Kansas City in being an IBM\nHey I don't know limited remained what's out and come come yeah yeah yeah I I I probably should have been the ...\nThe way I Love it I'm going to point out they've got a twenty miles a day got approximately eight days is going to take up at six and when they when they get here can you imagine a driving cross country with your kid\nAnd how they complain about on a thousand dollars an hour\nOh man it's how are we there yet or are we there yet I have to go to the point where we there no Lucy and I ... I Lived through bad it is it's no fun well if it is if they do have a thousand miles to go\nHad a ticket or two in my life but it also helps having a radio and TV show because I get to say hello to you\nIn front of serving the community sometimes that helps me sometimes that doesn't I have had a chicken or two in my life but it also helps having the radio and TV show because I get to see lord of the officer on the air and that seems to get me somewhere too I'm sure mark lamb sure we talked about this in Washington how close to the border is pronounced county are you on the border\nWell we're not on the border we're about Seventy miles off the border and\nWe have an Indian reservation that hung out with them in the nation that's on the south into our county is a very big Indian reservation that actually runs all the way to the border and across the board awhile part reservation in Mexico\nAnd so it's a very unique situation that's one of the or their community as in the Vatican we'd been opposed to a wall across their reservation\nWhich put them in a split them apart yeah\nYeah and so and that's one of the big reasons it would split their reservation apart and so what happens is that there is only a three strand barbed wire fence across that area and that's one of the sauce spots where it's easy for these people to come across it's about a six day hikes through the desert um\nUnless somebody a there's a coyote that transports them in a vehicle upright who\nSo about five miles south of the I ... interstate is one of the reservation ends\nAnd they had that five miles spot where they have to try to get across\nA lot of people ... on the other side on the reservation says would be responsible for charging ... drug possession right now we have a they typically have a five hundred pound threshold of marijuana so you don't have more than five hundred pounds which any individual backpack or only probably as thirty to fifty pounds right and they do that\nAnd so they wait till\nThey'll sit right on the edge of the reservation and when they think it's a good time they'll make that last five mile push because if they get caught and put out county they're going to get charged with state charges and that's where the agenda\nBut what can we ... would you bordering right on the news on this uh I'm a ... Indian reservation I'm guessing you have to cooperate with them do they cooperate with you I Can't imagine they would want four thousand illegal immigrants on the reservation overnight\nYou know there are good partner um\nPeople don't want to end up on the reservation there's no jobs there's not a lot of job opportunities there so they want to get the Phoenix because from there is a lot easier for them to get all over the country so their goal is not to stay on the reservation I'm although I'm sure some do\nNow their goal is to get up to the I ... interstate so they can transport the humans and the drugs that's the cartel that's what I tried to tell people all over this country is it's not about this guy coming to wanting to work in this country roads about our tell controlling human trafficking and drug trafficking in our country\nSo quite literally if I'm if I'm geographically getting it right in my head if they get through the the reservation the first time they step in to the United states would be in your county\nCorrect yeah it's our county now our county goes quite a few miles into the reservation as well right I ... the\nBig portion of the county of the reservations in our county but where it really starts to affect those bringing the drugs and the human trafficking is that about that five mile mark when they get into to where they could be charged in ... county and then the state of Arizona\nShare of mark lamb he of course ... County Arizona you may or may not have seen them on a lie pd which I I loved it hopefully you guys will be on the Reagan sued 'em for me\nWatching the caravan of two to five thousand people none of whom really need political asylum they've actually said we're going to remember what we want we want jobs you want whatever you know you and I are are are good guys we we want people to have a better life I'm Glad that my my grandfather immigrated here from Italy legally\nAh when you see an influx like this and it's also very close to to be election there's probably a political slant to it\nFlux like this and it's also very close to to the election there's probably a political slant to it do you work closely with ice the or close to the chest your closely with the White House who do you work with seeing this mass of people who may be heading into your county soon what do you do to prepare for something like that\nYou know I was actually a on a phone call about three weeks ago with a our eyes director because you know we have to be done to hear nice yeah\n[laughter] but I was on the phone about three weeks ago the ... the director vice here in Arizona and we were talking about this issue about this this large group of people that was coming I like you shenanigans or going on there was too close to an election\nI haven't been in these foreign countries these did their small villages to rally this many people something something behind um regardless of that we still have to deal with the problem right even the\nWhatever regardless of how they got here who's behind it they're still coming on our doorstep and we're having to deal with it um\nAnd it's a tough situation I'm like you like you said I Want people to come here I Want you to make a better life but then again you have to follow the rules that's what we're asking to follow the rules that are set for they're not coming for political asylum that they were they would've stopped in Mexico right\nThere really coming to get into America and this is a push to the dangerous thing about this court\nIs as they've gone further further there's less and less women and children right is ... I'm In that way man is predominately young man\nIt's very easy for gang members and uh people that are that do not have good intentions to get mixed up into this is and it makes it really easy and for that matter it's really easy for terrorists to get mixed into this group and that is alarming for us as law enforcement here in Arizona\nI talked to her she got real yesterday she is a ... for America done or good great national security outlet it and she's just a really smart person she says that they've already found several people who aren't from ... south or or Central America they're certainly not from Mexico they're finding people who speak Spanish\nWho speak um some other language that you might find in the middle east so there are I'm with you there shouldn't shenanigans going on this is ... somehow to balance the power after the capital hearings and now you've got all the co horrible Trump is on on the um on the border and I I'm\nNot really getting into that with you but but the real boots on the ground and and that's who you literally are you guys have to deal with is how prepared are you if you get four thousand people all of a sudden and the next few days what do you do\nNow we work very well with ice and border patrol but this is a different situation and what we're used to dealing with because what's happening is these people just want to get in the country yeah typically what they do they run from they tried to hide for border patrol and from us\nRight now they're actually running to border patrol and try to because they know that once they're in the country\nThey can they're making these political asylum claims and then what do we do it and all these people you know this is the ... this is a problem that should have everybody in this country\nTheir ears shouldn't be hurt and they should be wondering what are we going to do you agree town\nWe're gonna continue to protect our communities are we uh we're concerned about the amount of people that are going to flow into this country and in our communities and so we're watching this very closely\nBut you're from law enforcement guy and I say that\nYou're yes it's a compliment but it's also your job I've got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am a where the where the share of just doesn't care about enforcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws oh enforce these laws you seem to be a guy that says no here's the book this is where the laws are I'm going to follow those I'm going to enforce those going to make sure people abide by them\nWhat reaction do you get from people in our county the residents there last question marketing appreciate the time or what reaction do you get from them when you say if and when they get\nWhat reaction do you get from people in our county the residents there last question marketing appreciate the time or what reaction do you get from them when you say if and when they get here and we're going to make sure that we we you know stick to the laws are in or is there a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nWe're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands the majority of the people understand the immigration issue we're dealing with\nCars running from us almost ... almost every night were given the drugs coming into our community are you being affected by heroin and buy 'em by ... by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public and are you hooked on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county we get for the most part you know and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect out of the I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we had a lot of support from our up from the people ...\nAre good is if they sound like very good people and they certainly have a great sheriff sure mark lamb but al ...

S. admitted Thursday and Fox News or they believe the caravan to be at least partly politically motivated we have evidence that this carbon is also a very much politically motivated investor good here said we're obviously sensitive to the humanitarian situation that we encounter and we're acting precisely said\nBut we've also made it clear that there is no legal ground on which Mexico can issue a permit by which people can just go through Mexico towards the United states he concluded well why are they still come and then if that's the case\nWhy that he's the or are they still underway here\nWe come on\nAnd the reason is is because either Mexico does it love its own country and it does you see if the soccer matches where people are all screaming and yelling Mexico and waving Mexican flags does not have been all of their own country they just don't think they they should have to worry about it\nThey think that we have more so we should have to worry about it for some reason we're on the hook and I just don't understand that\nAny day nine for one pack Joe packs dot com Senator John Cornyn at the bottom of the er make sure you keep it here for that let me go to the phone lines and say how do I want is Jeff in ah in Texas hijab what's going on\nHey Joe you know I got to tell you man I had a hard job every day and when I come home and I listen to your show by the time is over I'm well\nThank you man I appreciate that that's why I like to do\nI yeah I Know and you should go ahead and put this on CDs or whatever the marketing thing is put it all together from the beginning and then I'll be buying the tire out [laughter]\nI briefly on that plane like crazy I limit personally thank you\nAnyway I got an just tell you okay just starting here I think this is a perfect storm and I think that the sheriff earlier comment on the kid in a little bit but I think he's in the dark on what I Believe this worry okay\nWhat is is these are are in mixed up with military eight eighty percent better I'm saying okay I've been watching the road and eighty percent better as military aged okay Fifteen to thirty\nThirty five okay that's happening now they're picking them up and pick up trucks OK and load them up they're coming quicker now I Believe this is a plant and I think\nThe last they now gone so far they are with ... they're being\nA ate it and the money's coming from the ... and Russia and everything communist in South of this I Believe this is a red dawn happening that guy's boss he says and then the other guy called before him that said it was an invasion he's more right than he no\nWell I I agree that there is an attempt now to see how far they can get it and and it's going to cause the president\nNow there'll be added on there's hundreds of training camps are going to be coming out of the\n... I mean it's if it's the talk shows here and if it keeps on growing that's going to make this point even more salient the president now but when you use that hold on hold I already I heard that family let me respond back [laughter] anyway or the president now has the opportunity\nTo do something as the executive in chief as the commander in chief he now sees that this is not just some gaggle\nOf migrants hoping for a better life right this is actually now like fighting age men veteran predominant in this caravan and this hordes of people and he's gonna have to do more than just put physical presence there without arms\nHuman veteran predominant in this caravan and this hordes of people and he's gonna have to do more than just put physical presence there without arms you're going to have to put people there who claimed physically fight people if they have to we have to make it clear that the border means something\nJoe let me just say this please it's going to not the enemy is here fifty percent of the country okay they're here to chai comes here by thousands soldier's okay they already set everything up all the the ... the east coast west they're going to come from everywhere every communist country everything because the lip\nNow knows they don't have anything don't want this like they know they've been found\nOut they don't have anything going for 'em and except have a civil war\nAnd that is going to happen but still the veterans know what I'm watching it bad I'm I'm telling ya I'm seeing it clearly this is the red dawn we've all been bearing and we're looking right at it we're going to come up with everything else but what really is happening everybody\nBetter get ... well they'll do that on the left might say that the writers and saying that the majority of middle American idols there were\nNine ... we're not we're not going to sit back and watch your Jeff were not no you that's why we're having conversations like this or not I raised my friend who's in office but I Know you've that's military is getting stronger and very like I like ...\n... and I loved Joe legit like crazy it was very complimentary Lovett Jeff love it I Can't just let you go four minutes and not say anything they actually pay the does the show but I Do love it it's uh eighty nine for one pack Joe ... dot com line three or four is gonna be Fe in Kansas right what's going on about a minute\nAgo I guess if you were at this camp and come in and sure I hate that like a year or two shareware at it is and it can get our allies any real and well at least thing is getting a little tired rubber bullets\nWell I think there has to be there has to be some sort of a force waiting on the border so that people coming here can't you know like phone back and say hey that he printed stop us at all did you come on up\nBecause I Know you've been you'll have millions of people heading from you know from lower income uh countries from ... from South and Central American countries in from Mexico itself to come into our borders we we have to make sure we dissuade them as they get closer and that's that's really important but it really is it's vitally important that we actually\nDissuade them we can't just say hey welcome\nMarine New Jersey I've got about a minute Murray make it out but\nYes a chow also I watch the blaze a blend back and I agree with him a lot he says that these are mocks his communist\nThat are coming to our country and they want to get rid of the western civilization completely now I also heard someone say mentioned like a solution for the president that it's still on the books and I think it's the Congress alien act\nThey're better off if we if we can provide security for our borders and our broken immigration system so I think it's based fundamentally on results and it's taken a a\nA a guy like President Trump who's not a politician who who knows how to capture people's attention to uh to get it done and I think a\nBy and large people people like it was more of it\nIn Senator John Cornyn Republican or a state of Texas the other seat is up for grabs as you said your friend of mine Ted Cruz going for reelection he's done a very good job and he's six years or his competitor the congressman Robert Frances calls himself Beto O'Rourke\nUm he in every debate so far John has brought you name up\nLike you're on his side like you and he worked together he really has I mean I don't know if you've seen the you have like I've worked with John Cornyn Senator John Cornyn I and I in John ... so do you think I I'm I'm sure this is what he's doing but I Wonder if you agree but he's trying to tell moderate\nThose people lean to the right a little bit moderate down the middle moderate to the left a little bit don't worry I'm not the radical they say I Am John Cornyn Scott me and my I got my back\nWell I I I'm for Ted as you know and I do believe that they do is a radical when it comes to the policies that he is espousing he is a is a\nQuintessential national Democrat yeah which means he's profoundly out of step with the Texas values in Texas voters on everything from immigration to impeach the president from\nFrom a base abolishing eyes\nUm all of these radical positions that are being a spouse that national level so says he's four and I guess I have to give him some credit for his candor is he uh is he a pleasant guy a yes is he a charismatic yes is he somebody that I Would be willing to work with where we find common cause\nThis guy a yes he is he a charismatic yes is he somebody that I Will be willing to work with where we find common cause on improving our ports of entry and trade\n'em but but I certainly think he's the wrong choice for a protects us and we certainly don't need another vote for Chuck Schumer to beat the potentially next majority leader of the United States Senate\nAnd that's exactly what it would be he's made it clear that he would be bad he's also made it clear that that he's sort of be a new you know Obama two point oh he's the guy that's on eh when he met the guy that some of the late night shows he's the guy that as you said is bringing charisma but not really talking about not out loud anyway what he would really do\nAs a very far left wing senator from the great state of Texas when you see this much money flowing in from outside of our state does that give you concern\nAbsolutely absolutely this is a this is a new phenomenon Joe I have never seen this before where you have an incumbent senator and a red state like Ted Cruz has done a good job\nThrough 'em and seen unprecedented amounts of money coming from all over the country in the small donations that are raised over over the Internet\nAnd it's it's a it's a sobering thing because ah to have an incumbent red state senator being out raised and outspent by his opponent is a is something we've never seen before\nThirty million dollars he's raised it's more than any senatorial campaign ever John should we take a look at a at the availability of people from outside of be the given state\nTo send money in I mean I'm not a big regulation guy I'm a low tax guy but I mean if California or ... wherever you lives can inject this much money into races in our states or in our counties in our cities I mean who's running the joint\n[noise] well that's a good question um and a good point I actually had somebody bring that up to me just a few moments ago\nAfter a rally with Ted Cruz in a in a while you mentioned county\nI'm just north of Austin right and you know we don't allow people from foreign countries foreign nationals to contribute to our national elections from I think that's a legitimate question why should people from other states be able to inject\nTheir money into a race that for ... whoever will represent the state of Texas such a good good point good question we ought to pursue\nIts a Senator John Cornyn senator you been a great supporter of the military even a great supporter of lower taxes lower regulations we're seeing more exports of oil from Texas and the importance I mean where things are looking really good the idea that we would ever handed to the other party is one that makes me crazy um how do you feel going in\nI I feel like maybe the Senate gains two or three seats but we've got to get people out to vote and the house really is up for grabs if the house goes the other way the tax cuts to point oh go away tax cuts for middle class families goes away and the economy probably start slowing down how are you feeling going in\nWell you're right because Nancy Pelosi ... your driver's seat and we know that you know a\nA R alive or the or find\nCommon cause with President Trump on anything so I think\nBasically Congress will shut down by and large for the next two years\nExcept for we maintain the majority of the Senate which I'm optimistic we will do will continue to be able to confirm judges like judge Kavanaugh Judge Gorsuch and the other uh eighties to federal judges that we've confirmed so far right but I I'm I'm traveling to uh\nUh to Dallas a on Thursday or Pete Sessions\nRace there is on the on the line on the bubble and then that John Culberson in Houston John quarter in\nIn ... county where I just left right\nThere is on the on the line on the bubble and then that John Culberson in Houston John quarter in a in ... county where I just left right I'm all of these are very close races and so that's why it's so important that your listeners get out and vote in each of these congressional races because it's not just Ted Cruz is not just Greg Abbott\nIt's these down ballot races that could determine who is the next speaker of the house or in the house representatives in two thousand Nineteen\nAnd Senator John Cornyn a couple of quick question senator of first of all walking Castro who is a I think district twenty ... a Democrat from\nI'm from the great city of San Antonio you know him you know his brother I mean this guy is a far left wing radical guy who just a few days ago I actually alleged that that Jared Kushner gave a hit list to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nAnd then the crown prince took action that's like a show used dead when a U.S representative says something so stupid he's trying to back away from it now\nBut when he says something so stupid I mean is there anything that can be done legislatively in the house can be censured can I mean you don't say something like that that the president's son in law ordered the death of somebody\nWell I don't think it was an accident and I think it was probably premeditated yeah an intentional but I Can't think of anything more reckless for a member of Congress to say than to accuse somebody or something like that without any evidence whatsoever I'm it it it's a I think a disgrace\nHandles seen the video and then he said he didn't say it but we've all seen the video he definitely Senate\nYeah well it's it's I unfortunately this is one of those political issues that I think is going to be decided at the at the ballot box you know it's probably not a whole lot that anybody could do I'm beyond that but I certainly would encourage people to\nTo ah remember of this and I'm and vote 'em the way they think is appropriate or enhance ways that's just not something that ought to be rewarded with the support\nI couldn't agree more now the last thing has to be the thing that everybody's keeping an eye on his this caravan of\nTwo thousand to five thousand people heading north\nI'm a these are not people who either are looking for or need political asylum when their question these are people that say we just want to get a different job a better job maybe a better life and I get that I mean everybody wants a better job better life but that's not somebody who gets political asylum generally speaking our friends who I actually go aren't doing as much as I think they possibly can do\nAnd this also you're not going to like send out a Twitter message to everybody in Honduras hail its head north this is obviously something that was that that was put together by somebody on the left there's video out there that I've seen where people are handing money to those who are getting ready to jump onto this caravan of this hoard of people\nDon't what can be done I mean we can't have forty thousand five thousand people break from our border illegally and all claim asylum at the same time what can we actually do\nWell I I think the president is right that this is actually it would be tantamount to an invasion\nOf the United states and the president has authorities as commander in chief to whip repel any invasion of their country\nYou know this this is what I think again you mentioned uh the left over playing their hand on cap and all this is another example of that I Believe\nWe're all sympathetic to people who who would like to immigrate to the United states for a better life right but we don't believe that they should jump ahead of line the line of people who are doing it awfully and and waiting in line\nAnd so this is another example of kind of a mob controlling our orders in our policies and we we cannot let him limb\nUh there is a legal way for people to get their case heard before an immigration judge and it ought to be handled\nWe cannot let him Lin a there is a legal way for people to get their case heard before an immigration judge and it ought to be handled that way\nI like the way Senator Cruz mentioned it I think it was the first debate you had with ... you said they said the difference between they do work in me is I Believe in legal immigration not illegal immigration exactly and this seems to be encouraging illegal immigration\nA senator I thought but you've been an amazing job of the Jewish new Judiciary Committee when it came to Kavanaugh Oh thank you so much how you were you represent our state and really do it it was amazing yesterday speaking in front of that horde of very excited or Republicans conservatives Texans in Houston great job I rose appreciate jumped banks\nThank you Joe good to be with

management\nAnyway vulnerable but this case this a race is down to the wire\nAnd uh several polls now indicating that you know this could go Republican the Republican away if things turn out the way I think they're going to turn out\nAnd with John James now getting the media attention in the air time he deserves now but not as much as Andrew Gillum of courses who [laughter] Andrew Gillum as he he can't he can't do any wrong even when he does wrong or John James joins us now John it's great to talk to you you were fantastic\nOn the anger mangled last night we get we got terrific response to your parents I Know it was short but that's the nature of TV how you doing today\nI'm doing great and thanks for having me back on\nA John tell us a first of all I Want your reaction to this a series of comments about President Trump that when he says he's a nationalist that means essentially he's a white nationalist John your comments\nOr I I think that folks get so wrapped around the axle around the around identity politics and it's exactly what's driving as a part of the nation we're all Americans and one of the great honors that I've ever had my entire life is leading Americans at the battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home\nYou know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics are the only things that are that look the same on us\nOur our uniforms are we are together all American and I don't have a black message or white Mrs I said last night but it red white and blue message and I I feel like you have um the the progressive Marxist on the left who don't have a message and they don't have an identity so we need to use identity politics\nIn order to keep themselves in power I reject that fundamentally on either side far left are far right and I truly believe that by serving all Americans as as equals moving all up together it's exactly the type of leadership we need Washington\nWell again the alerts to claim racism\nOr at every turn and to claim it's either a combination of ... being a wild and racist or Trump being Hitler which is which is now it's so disgusting on so many levels and insulting to Holocaust survivors and you\nKnow all people everywhere are but to me that's a sign of Democrat desperation John they have they have no real solutions Debbie Stabenow your opponent\nIn the Michigan Senate race clearly has no idea she has no solutions for America it's all about insults personal insult a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees and\nThis this is a basic this is absolutely base you know we we learned the amount of the state of English class the logical fallacies ad hominem attacks\nOn what you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these fallacies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on\nDebbie Stabenow a for her part has been a career politician for forty years has collected four million dollars from the taxpayers only got five who her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and three of those ... remain buildings she likes to bipartisanship is a buzzword when she's anything but\nShe's a solid a as a New York senator loaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five and nine to ... some of the time respectively and the promises he she's made around ... around Lauren pharmaceutical drug costs around\nTaking care of education and around um funding emergency ah funding for our troops who are deployed and and our veterans who were coming back home she's broken palms and so when I say to her all the time and I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to ask is why should we believe this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get reelected\nAnd I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to ask is why should we believe this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get reelected they will engage in this politics to drive us apart and what I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we in all this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this uh I'd love to have established now claiming she's against sanctuary cities where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of\nOf majority rule in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't\nRemember Debbie stamina standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for 'em you know better trade policies against a China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants to forty four year career in politics to continue suddenly she's Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\n[noise] she she is a selective uh in in in her positions she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her I'm centers to have it on and you can\nSee our debate a on John James for Senate dot com and follow around a but senators now will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she supports sanctuary cities and uh she will not do anything to secure our borders she's going up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is not that we need to get done right now all we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd uh the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who is going to work with anyone and everyone to get this thing done because this is a matter of uh of economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if Debbie Stabenow gets re elected on national security will be jeopardized in our ability to grow our economy will also be jeopardized\nHey John what is the reaction\nAmong African Americans in your state uh Europe proud combat veteran\nAre you a West Point graduate are you um you're a Republican which is is you know it's it's not something that a lot of people in Michigan you know are are used to because the Democrats still have a\nYou know they'll have a monopoly on the black vote but are you finding you're getting\nMore black support in your state is or or does the Republican label's still scare people off\nWell I'll tell you what if people get to know me for me as people begin to disassociate a me from the are by my name or the color my skin or they begin to realize that hey guys um this this guy may\nWant to Republican primary in a in the state and ah I'm going to be the only African American at the top of the ballot ... and people are starting to realize that everything that I'm saying a rings true\nAnd you take a look at ... now has failed to do with with uh with what concerns African Americans and uh and Michigan disregard was raised around the state uh they're taking a look at this keeping an open mind and beginning to come over I\nI Believe that the only ones who are not are ones who are who can't see past a of a a blind hatred or blind allegiance but those who I'm Talking talking to who are keeping an open mind and I recognized the I'm the best leader\nUm Fort Michigan into the future or bringing balance an actual experience on both from a combat environment understanding veterans' issues and national security\nFrom a business environment understanding how to create jobs and how to protect the American dream for future generations to include our children Detroit is the most segregated city\nNo I was in the country and it's it's not that I loved it\nAt the American dream for future generations to include our children Detroit is the most segregated city\nKnow now it seems like a hundred and ... it's not that I Love those rights but historically one of the most beautiful places incredible architecture incredible history of music and arts and architecture talked and and it was amazing decades of Democrat rule\nHave destroyed so many great American cities like Baltimore and in St Louis and and now are of course Detroit making something of a comeback but\nOut so much more needs to be done John James best of luck to you and your race against Debbie Stabenow in Michigan uh everybody get out there and support a John he's just a fantastic a young man and a he has the right ideas for the state\nAnd he ... he doesn't want to be considered a African American Republican candidate he wants to be considered the right candidate for the right time for the state of Michigan\nA and John we'll issue all the best and thank you for your service to this country uh we honor at and we support you were going to take a break eight five five forty Laura we're going to

[laughter] ... yeah um\nSo I I I'm not gonna take about well here's what I think might have happened and then a Soros called his mother ... that's that's not going to get us anywhere but um it is certainly interesting\nFirst of all I'm Glad nobody got hurt and all these packages and get anywhere near the famous people that they were sent to you they've got people opening their packages some of them were found in the post offices some of the worth of sorting facility none of them got into the hands of the people that allegedly where the targets that is true right Kerry and that is correct yes\nRight so let's let's let's not pretend that it was on Bill Clinton's doorstep and somebody you know tackled him to get him out of harm's way that didn't happen\nBut having said that I'm I'm Glad that nobody got hurt and I wish that this hadn't happened\nThe story right now is they don't know who sent it\nOr them they don't know who made the the bombs are the things that looked like bombs they don't know who sent the white powder or whatever they do know the the the upper the way they did at the modus operandi the\nWay they performed this this dastardly Dede was to send either some directly to the buildings and to the people or they sent it and they put a false address on the front and they put a return address\nTo their actual target\nOn the return address part\nHaving said all of that we're very close to a midterm election\n\nThere's already a push by both sides to make the other side look bad could this be politics there's nothing right now factually that points to that\nBut could it be\nThe only thing that would give credence to that idea\nIs that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were very very very fast to come out and blame the president I mean that's actually kind of disgusting if you think about it it's it's gross that they would say oh a bunch of bombs were sent down and instead of trying to figure out\nWho's behind it what happened thank God the secret service found this that and the other thank God nothing exploded nobody got hurt their initial thing is the president did it and then carry read the story earlier and he's earned her words she's reading the news story\nTalking about how he took the sides of white supremacists in Charlottesville whatever freaking lie\nSo what's on your mind when it comes to what we see happening in the unfolding in the news today and we don't have a bunch of information other than what Kerry just gave you know to go to south who's in ... in Florida so I was going on\nYeah I Know Joe ... that's ... I'm calling from Florida but I get you on the on\nYeah I don't Joe living in ... I Can't\nGet to that I'm calling from Florida but I Can't get you on cable down there that are on the on cable and Florida and\nWhere are you in Florida a sunrise\nAll right well you know that I'm On a fifty a WFCR that's my radio station there on on television for the second hour it's Newsmax TVs review guide do shirt or direct TV or or or several other cable outlet you can get the show\nOkay I was going to say about this uh the bombs that were laid out there ah this was all a hoax this is like a Trump says the con job or they were somebody was paid a from South America that come in to Miami or to make the bombs so they couldn't get the day and I on these people they will love actually\nAnd they were planted a by folks his office and they can't they went from there to all and\nWhen you said you know so I guess I guess she ... she said Sosa\nYes or no shows ... where are you saying ... ... from Debbie shows oh shell do you think they were sent from her office\nThey were or somebody in her office was hey\nDo you think about you know that's how you're just seeing stuff\nI mean I'm just I'm just saying that's just an opinion okay it's the same\nKinds of conspiracy theories and they just said that I don't buy into the ... what makes you think that's all right what's next thing you point which actually new boy do\nI let me say this everything came out of Miami no facts though\nThat's effort it well this is I'm not saying facts but I think it came out of Miami and they were falling here and that phone out of the fact that South America but this is this the same thing as the con job with Kavanaugh that they brought this woman forward\nAnd they paid her to come on that say that Kevin all that all the stuff that's the same thing a ... and I don't think it's one person I think a lot and what a person that was involved in Atlanta the\nIllicit sound like an appreciate your opinion but again it's just a conspiracy theory and and I need more than I think that it was in Miami and I think that it was simply South America um if you got it carries your information saying that every one was sent from Miami is that out there and not then I had seen\nYeah I haven't seen that either I mean if that's true well added to the to the you know a bucket of facts that we have and it was okay here's what we know and then we'll try to put the pieces together but just saying it doesn't mean that is true Mick is also important Nick what's going on\n[noise] ah well I have a conspiracy theory of two but I'll Try and keep with the facts but it just sounds awful suspicious I think I'm somewhat self said ah rang true we think he's on the right track but have you just look at the facts um the fact that they pick the top ten\nMost hated a demo are all Democrats liberals and supporters uh nobody got hurt they were never really meant to go off none of them went off they were very obvious that they were obviously\nAs a as the attorney general of the United states he ignored immigration laws would ever President Obama wanted him to ignore him and pretend wasn't there he did and then when you questioned him on and he always called in race somehow so how is it\nWhy don't we get a day and age and your opinion Doug where where it's okay for attorney general on any level to say the laws don't matter\nIt it really is traveling I think in part of it the law has become quite politicized and that and that's because things have become so political and you know at the federal level that Eric Holder and job creation a certain point and judges\nThings have become so political when you're looking at the law that ... at the national result I think in ... and it was very troubling about him and see what he has said that he wants to use the office to push a little agenda he wants to see the president over and over and over and things from immigration to the Internet\nAnd try to push a policy agenda through the courts radical agenda\nOr no less that's completely inappropriate\nThat he's an executive promise to do it has to sue the price\nAs an end in debate he said he would do that he said he wouldn't do that he would bring lawsuits against the president and try to force policy change through the courts bypassing Congress bypassing the state legislature and that's just only inappropriate\nWithout the um be very strong very large concentrations of blue voters and Minneapolis St Paul and and the big urban areas you probably would be up by twenty points Europe by seven as it is\nWhat's the message that you're getting out or what's the message that you're receiving rather from from those constituents who would turn to you know enforce the laws who returned to you and say hey let's get Minnesota back on track what do you actually hearing from people as you're out there shaking hands kissing babies\nLives have been done about five hundred stops all around the state a so called less Eighteen months in what I'm hearing is that\nPeople instead of wanting to general will not be political and they're tired of politics in the office that we have an an attorney general and they're and they're tired of a thousand or they're concerned about a thousand pushing politics through the office and so that's what I'm hearing there are also very concerned about eight thousand support for calculus\nThe thousand or they're concerned about a thousand pushing politics through the office and so that's what I'm hearing they're also very concerned about some support for cop killers I mean he has this is a guy that repeatedly has been a cheerleader for criminals as Sarah jails and others on his ... now\nThe murders Los Angeles police officers using I I'm Sorry this is Keith Ellison spoke at a rally in a river and tried to raise money for her back in two thousand in in Minneapolis it's just very troubling stuff people are very concerned about that and it just doesn't make any sense for a person that\nRepeatedly supports cop killers to being a cop in the state\nI couldn't disagree with you it's Doug ward low he used a Republican running for attorney general and the great state of Minnesota um so being up by seven I'm guessing that you're not going to be complacent and sit in your hands because it is a very very active\nVery shaky very dry ration filled roller coaster right now heading to the actual election day I mean one day you're up by so many the next day you're down by by whatever and I don't mean you specifically but the Republicans versus Democrats nationally anyway we're seeing a lot of that\nIn Minnesota Minnesota ... seems to be a little bit confused when it comes to what it wants to be with a red or blue or purple or whatever it's going to be because in some cases it's not even close other races it's very tight are are you getting the feeling that people will stay engaged from now until the actual day they go in and start voting because there's a chance that could come down\nAnd generally speaking when the economy's good people relax and they don't go and vote are you afraid that might happen\nWell people are very energized right now the Republican base is very enthused people are very active and involved in quite a bit of attention so I'm not\nToo worried about that but we need to take nothing for granted just finish strong what's happening now with the federal point lead in the latest stock or being pole and that the I think it's the first time in a decade in the Republican in a statewide race in Minnesota has any kind of a significant lead in Minnesota\nSo the Democrats are in the state party here they're ... they're becoming unhinged and their leveling all sorts of attacks and they're just going in there there\nAre getting very very agitated could say so who knows what they might try to throw a my way we need to be ready for everything and just finish strong work hard and run all the way through the finish line and you need help from conservatives all across the country or to make sure that we can\nKeep a thousand other dirty jobs office\nKeith Ellison is not from Minnesota it's Doug ward low who is the uh the Republican running for attorney general against Keith Ellison not from Minnesota He showed up from outside I think from Michigan address there was a seat open and I guess it was available and he thought he could win a practical word I'm getting out of always exact history but there's a lot of outside money coming into where are you I'm In Texas\nFor the senators race against Ted Cruz\nI'm guessing there's a lot of outside money coming to support Ellison against you or any idea how much money is coming from outside and what these special interest might be because there is a widely broad outside of Minnesota desire to see a guy like deputy attorney general\nRight so ... says as but put money into a a ... here and there's quite a bit of outside money and it's kind of hard to see how much is coming in right now but there is quite a bit uh and so that that is a significant\nA problem and you need to fight back so it ... and his family are one of the significance of orders you know I think a key thousand wants to be the attorney general so he can lead other Democrat state attorneys general around the country in there at recess or I'd go after the president and bringing lawsuits against the president and lead the resistance\nIs how they do is put it in the past so that that's very troubling and we need to make sure that we have resources to push back against that\nI talked to Lara Trump last week the or the daughter in law President Trump she said she was in Minnesota has she met with you have the Trump been there to stump with you and for you if not are they going to be what sort of a a supporter you getting from Washington\nWell it's been it's been really good so um [noise] Donald juniors in town not too long ago and then also President Trump was in Rochester and go in the show\n... but it's been it's been really good so um [noise] Donald juniors in town not too long ago and then also President Trump was in Rochester and go in the shutdown is around there and and uh and that that was very good too is that we're getting log us or\n... generally speaking Minnesotans don't want it to be overly politicized I get that message from you today I got it from the last time we spoke\nI'm at the same time you keep on getting people I keep the Keith Ellison elected or in in ... why does that happen\nOr you like like your governor he's got to be one of the worst governors I've ever seen as governor Dayton I called governor ... you don't have to but I don't get it the guy is a hard time staying awake he says we want more refugees Alison as saying hundreds of thousands of refugees ... what's the deal is it is it's sort of bipolar and they've stayed politically because\nI get the feeling the regular Minnesota does it want this kind of thing\nBut I think I read a regular basis or does not want things to be too political uh and Minnesota's pride themselves and being very independent gentle\nParties and the big thing in in Minnesota but I think what ... what happens is that Democrats up and run as very conservative Democrats are very moderate during the election and then after the election they show their true colors and then you know a few months or election they sort of a change their skins a little bit again that's kind of goes here in Minnesota\nSo what is the last question do we appreciate Doug ward low he's a Republican from the great state of Minnesota wants to be the attorney general I Hope to do this that he's going to be attorney general it would be horrible to have Keith Ellison a position the last question what does all the black ... now and and the sex of November um is it just nonstop for you to sleep at all just gonna be traveling the state ... what does it look like\nLarry too must be traveling all over the state meeting ... orders that I can just getting the message out there about how we need an attorney general's against him in the law and that message is resonating and then also make sure that the bars and southern ... about Keith Ellison and as it were to be going nonstop all the way through the end up working very hard all the way through election day\nWell we wish you the best you know the we support your candidacy or we hope you'll be the next attorney general it would be ridiculous you would be set back\nYou know by decades if somebody who stands accused of really credible allegations of treating women in this way or would be elected but also I mean let's not forget the ferret connection the limits are sort of connection the fact that he wants to bring in more are refugees and he wants to sue the government nonstop\nNone of that makes any sense Doug Woodward poet for ya which they controversial talk again before the election\nSaga thanks so much a creature you dug ward logo follow him on Twitter and if you're in Minnesota by all means discussion with your next attorney general back after this on the ... the writer\n\n[noise]\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well complicated especially as the weather begins to cool well one
