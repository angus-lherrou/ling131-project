I mean they're just you don't hear that I'm a certified under way down\nI mean I there's definitely abject obviously but there's something I'm like man I Need us right now\nWell what a great segue because I Know just the person who would love to chat with you oh yeah I'm not the entire portfolio of craft beers she's the Tucson sales representative\nOr a dry run up and got wrapped around going on girlfriend\nYou think you've got mad at me and C. J. you definitely give me a call next week and we'll see about getting some ... friends are saying well you don't want to go someday [laughter]\nLike brand name calling me anytime he laid out I'm looking\nI'm looking at you must be so absolutely busy I mean when he put sixty Seventy eighty hours a week to be the Tucson you know a a sales rep for ... Brewing Company and she said well I Know and it's a week yeah\nBy went up to no one\nGuy with jobs graph anyway I'm fascinated by this whole um a process called cask conditioning where he we're hearing more brewers talk about it works where we're seeing it more on you know kind of be the portfolio of such around town and I want to listen to kinda get their heads around exactly what we mean when you're ...\nOn the spirit side but also more recently on the Bruins thought well what do we mean by task conditioning\nAbsolutely so you know you talk about legit beer that's what Kashmir is Kath beer is the way that beer is meant to be enjoyed\nSo were you know releasing are ... and we just so happened to have released it on task is well don't take it back up\nYou know it is a buzz where people are talking about Kashmir this new hot thing and the thing is is it's not it's a throwback how beer is really supposed to be enjoyed so when we talk about task it's referring to out condition in the vessel itself so there's a couple of different ah ways we can do that in a ... there are two different sizes they call it looked like\nHim [laughter] about first you know [laughter] I was told not to\nSwear before I went on the show and I was really nervous and I did because it's second\nNeighbors to our allies are good or whatever you want it up you know there are ... [laughter] when we talk about cats were\nTalking about about the way that it's conditioned so when we cast condition of beer we actually take it out of the for men or after the initial fermentation has done so after it's been in the for men or a couple of days we pull them out in in ... which are similar to kegs and in that\nThey're still alive he still hasn't finished for many young and so the live years we throw in some priming sugar and we throw in some a conditioning agents such as eyes and glasses helps clear up the beer and in the casket conditions in the vibe used as a working and\nIt's creating different aromas and flavors that you don't necessarily get on the finished product that you get on draft\nAnd how would you how would you define those rumors in those flavors that are coming out of the cast expression or when you know compared to other more conventional draft expression\nSo one of the biggest differences in comparison to the conventional a draft beer is the temperature which at CERN so normally you have a beer served you know you want that ice cold kind of beer refreshing cold hides a lot of bad flavor as high as a lot of imperfection cast you are getting exactly what that bears the posted to tastes\nLike okay so in other words this this uh I'm doing the frosty friends draft and this is probably wanted about thirty five thirty six degree dish right about thirty seven thirty eight or whatever the cash conditions version is coming in I couldn't be about forty five about forty five\nSo you're going to get a lot more of those hop aromas you're going to get some of the flavors from that use that was still active that God isn't going to be in that draft so I Would recommend trying the Kashmir after that meet meet even doing a side by side\nOf the students fermentation things you just just made me you're like ... I don't I don't really know 'em right out the restaurant have just jars of rotting on the shelf like\nIt's all science is out there you know are there appears that lend themselves well to a task expression or you know ... or their beers that really would not be able to to manifest themselves in that kind of intentional way if they're if they're done on\nCash really personally I think ah for example are Santa Cruz or golden al one of our newest year round bears that we offer I sat on cash to me is perfection atmosphere how it is supposed to be enjoyed you get really nice flavors from the mall that come out that don't necessarily come out on draft\nYou get more of the hops a lot of times are birds like to have fun with the cats they'll throw in some extra hops or maybe even some grapefruit rinds or some lemon and get extra citrus notes and it's nice it's a lot of fun\nAnd uh yeah and so we takes up the recipe just to be interesting but you know our perspective is not only do we get to be with people that we like that and do business with but we also get to teach them kind of what we do um when we were self distributing we we\nDid the job of the wholesaler for for a few years and I tell you that is a is a hard job\nThat you guys are good though I bought them you know when you're thinking about family I mean their their job is to get your beer\nOr logistics master their logistics pastures uh and um you know John John Hubbard oh yeah yeah ... just very good friend of mine I've been trying to get into co hosts the show for a long time he was very difficult to\nTo you know to pin down while you get to do it on a golf course and you'd probably get a gun and engaged got ya up but um what what was the level of sophistication that these ... that that people in the business of beer\nBrought to the brewing and beer I mean did you have to go one on one with these guys and says this is the FARC and this is a PIN\nI'm this is what words is\nYeah I mean there were some of these fine says it all [laughter] so I don't know is that it is now\nNow he was at a time for that but um there are a couple of guys that that didn't know too much that the uh you know we have to kind of talk about the basics but several of them knew what was up in a couple of them are ... and you know for for a home or to come into a professional ... and Bruce\nMost of their dreams you know that but it's all totally and they become by default almost ... of the bread I mean I Know they represent different companies but renting a I Would say that if you got someone on the corporate side\nIt's a base in the brewing process when they're distributing the product they have a little bit different of a story to tell then versus just getting beer from point a to point B\nAbsolutely they get a little bit of more of the buying and also you know bring a batch of takes six hours so that same for us to hang out when you know we're waiting for the next process that come up in the meantime place [laughter]\nWhat's your favorite pizza by the way no one no one was really what I was not ... meets in Tucson from Brittany Rawlins\nI mean I'm going to have a lot of people be mad at me about this wind by a million people when he said no anchovies forever oh let me ask you know it's always you know when I was a robber might resonate there once a week when the best me or to have with that pizza when did you get your hands down no question\nSo how long are you guys been a business person six and a half year it's been six and a half years now I Am see the board and root beer battle every year and hotel calm and and I gotta tell ya um for the first like four or five years five it was like ...\nHa ha ha ha ha\nHa\nHa I mean uh you know after we won five term limits now you can't win because you're not\nWe found out we said we said we want to support your Congress has been a great business partner um incredible bar a credible fast or we just said hey you know we won five years let's let's let somebody else have you ever go door to\nMe All right you got to hire and retire with dignity that's right well you're very Sanders approach that you brought home a lot of hardware do yeah uh\nBut the thank you for having the opportunity to actually say someone else yeah name or when I announce the winner but when I was thinking about a craft brewery um there are there are stories that are behind\nA and kind of attitudes behind every operation so there are some brewers that are just like totally about you know salaries and there's something we want to be the I. P. A. team and then we knew it better than anyone and such but when you're thinking about culturally\nDragon Brewing Company since you guys are all along the huge spectrum of different styles\nAnd personalities on the beer seen what do you want to improve company known\nFor this community I think the biggest thing is to be a part of a community um we really respect our employees and we really appreciate the time and energy that they give us and our you know in America and are working are making and selling beer on and we want to do do I buy them but we also want to be involved in the community we've got some great partners out there I'm\nOn fire like a a soccer I'm right on but as I said I sacrificed southern Arizona arts and culture lives yeah yeah so I mean we we want to be involved as much as we can but I'm obviously where makes sense you know um\nWe don't we don't tend to do beer festival of out of town out of out of state and\nWant to go through all the way around that I think that goes all the way round the corner community too because I remember buying a hauled off of route from you know oh yeah because I was sad spent a gloom Graham yeah and so that's part of the community to have different you know in the ...\nAnd you're talking about community too with with collaborations you know we did this one with family um but we've done several with other ... are we done a few uh ten fifty five I'm ... I'm In Phoenix and Tucson and that's just the that's an opportunity for us to to hang out with her brothers and sisters and um you know [noise]\nDo something that hard difficult for me it's a lot of labor and then what Bernie said after you're done when you go have a\nAnd the victory so much more sweeping I said or the labor I noticed that ten fifty five here yes all on your board today a and that is an honor a but the newest member of the vibe or in the household correct little jak minority leader right now he's cute next time ... when you see Jae people I ... I Want you know asking\nThis question I Want to ask him\nAnd I'm not going to say anything else [laughter] and I want you to tell me what he said because I'll tell you whether he's telling the truth\nOr whether he's not but uh we Russell man of mystery we talk about the craft beer community\nDressed in white ten years ago there were three brewers in this town ... they're twenty and change anything around twenty four twenty five by the time the show is probably what what's your perspective on on this local craft beer\nI mean it's it ... the movement that grows the renaissance it shows no sign of stopping is that good bad or otherwise I think it's I think it's good\nUm I think the for beer most of beer is supposed to be fresh and so the closer you can get into your home the better I'm right obviously keeping your money in ... and down the street and your neighbors and you know there's there's so much more to it than that but at the at the very base of you're talking about the product [noise]\nTypically best fresh so um [noise]\nYou know I don't I don't know I thought this for a few years I don't know when a ... stopped growing to be nationally um there's still a few that I think in the national Center for making the last movements to become national ...

[noise] the\nConversation going to Mars Larson done welcome back\nTo the Lars Larson show blind to be with you and Glenn to take your phone calls and emails we'll get to that Kanye West have\nJust a little bit later on this hour but ah I've got Frank ... with me who's a a foundation professor at George Mason university ... school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed this ... welcome to the program thanks for the John\nLarson thank you for having me\nI'll tell you I Know there are a lot of people who are dismayed by the fact that we now have a disruptive force of a president but frankly I I think we needed a disruptive force and your thesis is that he delivered just what we need it\nAbsolutely right I mean we were bound for stagnation remember when people talked about ... percent groping the new normal got four percent yup they said it could never happen and we had a\nYeah I'm Sorry to say we had a Republican Party led by you know really nice people but they just were up to the struggle of taking on the bench\nNo they weren't and so he's kind of kicked the bucket over enforced everybody to rearrange things and obviously that causes disruption I mean it didn't cause the departures soon enough for me of Paul Ryan but uh but he we we are getting rid of him eventually I mean now at the end of the year\nUh but but this is the kind of thing that occasionally even private organizations need you need somebody to come in and act as a disruptor\nCat food they write you know and the thing about and I'm like All right and I couldn't agree more the thing is you know the Republican Party has lost touch with you know with ordinary Americans\nAnd I work on the campaign I wrote speeches for the for the president I I I ... we were very consciously going after just regular American you know all races creed and all that I mean but we're looking after the people who have been left behind\nAnd I you know I'm I'm afraid that the kind of Internet\nDoesn't it seem and I I look I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I've got a dog in the fight here so I've got an a built in biased but when I see the Democrats trying to position themselves as the\nThe you know the party of the working man and working woman I keep wondering uh policies they adopt seemed to be about shifting and redistributing wealth which means not just the well to be like Donald Trump and Bill Gates but also the wealth of\nFolks who are just making a an average family income of I think now the mid sixty thousand dollar range their redistributing that wealth as well and and so there there it's the antithesis of representing that individual worker\nWho's probably worked very hard to get to that sixty or Seventy thousand dollar household income\nYeah by the way that's up from about fifty six thousand above five years back where we are doing pretty good I mean wages are going up but you know the the thing about the the dams as they invested in identity politics which had nothing to do with the concerns of of people looking for a job\nAnd you know and and now they're talking about socialism and a boy talk about a way to bankrupt the country I mean that you know they they do not have a clue I mean I I feel sorry for ordinary Americans in a you know who who are misled into voting for these guys\nYou don't miss dramatically you just said something that made me think from time to time I'm Talking to folks and you follow politics closely so do I and sometimes they're used terminology that that seems a little opaque to folks and I've had people ask me about various terms and one of them is identity politics I Want you to define that\nFor my audience the way you see it\n[laughter] well it's hard to hear from them as a you know you start by saying what's their race what's their gender\nAnd so on and uh and and you know and then if you're the wrong ways that are wrong grander that does to your your your there they're not they're really interested in you but mostly you know it means that they're obsessed with\nYou know trivial concerns like\nTransgender bathrooms bicycle lanes I mean concerns that played to the elite of the country\nI mean it's only people are really rich you are going to worry about that stuff okay it's it's not the the coal mine are looking for a job or I Know it's out the oil worker was worried about about you know what regulations are doing to the economy so you know they they've got\nInvested in frivolous concerns of the people got you know made it\nAnd made me that everybody else behind I'm Talking to Frank Frank H Barkley who's at George Mason university ... school of law and the author most recently of the Republican workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed I I think you've spoken to some of these really important because\nWhen you become an a lead in other words most of the people that you have daily contact with\nOur people who've made it they make big salaries they don't have to worry about money nobody's saying I Wonder if I'll make the house payment this month of the car payment or can we really afford\nTo take a vacation this year these are people in an entirely different class and so like you say your your concerns change when those are the people you talked to daily and then but you have to build in or out and pretend\nThat you care about that coal miner who's being booed Hillary Clinton famously promise to put out of work right to their face and said we're going to put you out of work and then we'll find a job for a new running a computer or something\nI I tell you something that was really I found really interesting there's this county and Kentucky Harlan County the sacred ground to the left that that's where the the series justified is said and as where there was this big old union battled back in the Nineteen thirties\nPete Seeger had this song which side are you on and I I yeah I thought this is great you know I Know which side the elite is on I thought the coal miners and Harlan County voted eighty five percent for Donald Trump so you know but you know talking about the elite that look you know I Confess I'm living inside the beltway\nI'm a lawyer you know but then I aspire to be a traitor to my class 'cause I got these relatives\nWho are working on the assembly line in Detroit\nAnd I figure if I'm On the right side of them I'm On the right side\nI think you're absolutely right one of the things you wrote about in the wall Street Journal recently uh was telephone injustice what how does that figure into the whole equation the well it's you\nKnow I was making a point about the corruption of the rule of law and the way it works Russia is before a judge reaches a verdict telephone up the you know the party bought the old communist days you'd say what should I Do right so the ... you know using the telephone to determine where we're gonna be the result\nAnd I said you know in America we've got a somewhat similar problem they have to go to the law in Russia we got too much but here we got we got to search going on for the great Trump defendants and and you know mostly it is just kind of ordinary strollers like Mike Flynn who committed the crime of\nThe line to the FBI when he told the truth that wouldn't have been a crime\nNo it wouldn't have been a crime and and what's really ... I still don't understand the Flynn case 'cause I don't understand why he with his background didn't just assume whatever I talked to the right to tell the Russian ambassador\nIs going to be recorded by five different intelligence agencies in America and when the FBI does it say can we talk to you about your conversation you should assume that they already have every John ... from your conversation and they may be trying to maneuver into a into a process crime\nOr you know we're we're we're trusting people and and our sympathies lie with law enforcement of the FBI comes in talks you'd most people would say you know go and shoot I'll answer whatever you want to ask me and and and you know sadly wherever we are in a country is that is the wrong thing to do\nMaybe we should I mean I hate to say it Frankenstein had friends who were FBI agent Secret Service agents cops sheriff's deputies\nYou hate to started acting like when the police show up for the FBI shows have you say I should treat them like a treat the G argue if I was a a a an an occupant of of Russia or the old Soviet Union his book is called the Republican workers' party and he hails from George Mason university professor it's good to have you on the program we'll look forward to return\nThe person who decides whether or not a particular man or woman is the person for the job is the president the Senate can say this president you've nominated a thoroughly unqualified candidate we reject him or her but in this case they had to admit that Brett Kavanaugh was ... was a a fully qualified candidate\nSo their job was to simply affirmed that and put 'em on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one democratic voting the right way now I mentioned this\nLittle off it was amazing to watch this president Donald Trump sitting behind the resolute desk in the oval office today and Kanye West sitting across the desk from him\nAnd Donald Trump listening for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes and I'm not going to play all of it but I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is Kanye West and I know the standard line from the left is what this man is crazy now why did they think he's crazy because he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump\nTo the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy well I'm find to be put I'm I'm okay with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit of\nA I was sad and welfare of the reason why I say you know first of all let a lot of jobs I thought it was the job and they say is more money or had more here\nAnd then we got rid of the mental health issues and AIDS and then I and the ... just shy\nWhich is actually far harder now he\nHe mentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and inept Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on the problem I saw\nAh I think the way\nThat helps you to stay\nHere but it has the\nIt gives you power in a way he's talking about the hat\nThat is keep America great or keep America great twenty twenty or make America great done\nAnd he's saying this how gives you power and why you know my dad\nAnd my mom separated so I have a lot a male and she came out oh\nAnd also a problem area that I'm\nDoing all that\nYou know [noise] you know\nMay need to know the guy they get all the time like\nThe guy\nSaw it was\nIt made me feel like Superman made a Superman that they are this is the hero\nThat's Khan yeah he was saying that by putting that had on he becomes a superhero I Know that a lot of the left who said this man is crazy and yet in all of what he just said\nDo you do you find anything to object to he says he grew up without a male figure in his life and that that damaged him he said that an awful lot of young men end up on welfare and they effectively said gee young women\nHave more kids and we'll send you more money and that that's damaging as well and none of that ... that is all Republican orthodoxy it's it's conservative orthodoxy to say the programs that are supposed to help people often end up damaging them and you know for\nFor me the guy that looks you\nKnow what at that point I didn't believe that one out but I made sure it didn't hit the air if you're listening on stream yes he did use a couple of swear words and that was the one I miss but I I dropped out one out because yeah he was sitting in the oval office\nKanye West managed to drop a couple of swear words\nBut his message was all conservative and this is what's driving the left nuts they can't stand the idea that a man who was both black\nAmerican and successful it's sitting there in front of the president of the United states
