or alive dead or alive I I was just thinking about that I was just new to learn about that because\nYou know that's the game that I play oh wait a minute that wasn't me are playing that game that was the leading Democrat lite who gave us the bimbo are options and destroyed all the women that Bill Clinton violently sexually assaulted\nAnd uh that was James Carville he was a new one you see whether they're better off with Kavanaugh dead or alive there was the a schoolteacher in Minnesota I was reading the story yesterday calling on a someone to take one for the team\nAnd killed Brett Kavanaugh's schoolteacher and you know that school teacher will keep their schoolteacher job and then I'll be fine but\nThis is the violent murderous rhetoric of the mainstream Democratic Party this is not some fringe website\nThis is James Carville ... author of the member options author of the great line uh you never know what you get when you're dragging a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park he's the the uh the the standard bearer for women in America and he uh just get us this one too but the\nDemocrats Kavanaugh's worth a lot is worth a lot more alive and dead\nA cabinet to the Democrats you'll see Kevin ... is worth more to the Democrats alive than dead so I guess he's a dog whistle to their supporters is don't murder the Supreme Court justice\nBecause we're going to torture him to death because there are still after him like North Koreans swarming over a hill screaming like Ben Cheese with their band that's attached looking to ban at you and the throat because you know this ain't bean bag goes by says James Carville drag a\nAnd uh had a great time and his son both\nBut we weren't what it wanted by the Saudi Government and he went into the south who the embassy in Istanbul and never came out\nAs like it's like a Roach Motel that uh that fact and he went in and they never came up and it turns out that the the hypothesis is the theory is that the Saudis sent in a team of Fifteen men to ah take out this journalist ... right and he's disappeared\nAnd nobody knows where he is and one is one group says oh that jumped him up into pieces and took him out in separate suitcases something like that like it's a\nYou know when Alfred Hitchcock movie about one way or the other guy has been disappeared\nJust like the head of Interpol who was apparently grabbed by the Chinese 'cause their economies and the you know that's that's how companies David sell their companies have always behave and they'll throw 'em in the gulag or or just kill 'em or something ... the bill for the bullet to his family\nWhich the Chinese do the Chinese when they execute short and execute a lot of people they send the family the bill for the bullets that they use to kill you and your better pay it\nBecause they mean business right but the Washington Post their leader trail today actually brought lame Donald Trump for the Saudis snatching this guy in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul\nBecause they say that Donald Trump set the tone\nAnd now we have this big um and encourage them or something and it's just they're they have mental illness I don't know how they got all these people with mental illness into one business [laughter] and into one party but there's a lot of mental illness on the left and it's on parade boy is that on parade yeah so they're blaming they're blaming the Washington Post\nParents have this journalist shaggy because they believe that the Saudis grabbed the guy and bad things happened\nAnd uh and it must be Donald Trump's fault and speaking of hurricane Michael which is a horror show racing toward the panhandle of Florida Michael ... kind of proud he's got these headlines with hurricane his mom sending them test text messages asking him to not be too destructive\nAnd things like that [noise] ah but I assume there'll be blaming Donald Trump for hurricane Michael because they've blamed Donald Trump for past hurricanes\nSo they've got it's amazing how powerful they think politicians are they think that rock Obama can slow the rise of the oceans and that the healing of the planet we'll begin because he was elected the news media believed that they they sold that message for the Democrats and now they're selling the message that Donald Trump is responsible for hurricanes say\nThe Democrats affect the weather in the oceans positively and Republicans affect the weather in the oceans negatively\nThat is a sign of mental illness that is truly a sign of I'm not a a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist by any stretch of the imagination but that's a sign of mental illness you don't have to be I mean that's you're crazy you're not you're cook your a fringe case\nThat's that's crazy stuff and and let me also say a lot of this stuff are hearing from the news media and the and the Democrats just a few years ago what is mainstream now just a few years ago would have considered to be would have been considered to be fringe extremism\nThe rhetoric of the left the get in their face the dead or alive up all this stuff they these people are\nThese people are a medicine it's not as though there is no violence that's going but there's lots of violence that's going on whether Brooke Baldwin is aware of it or not I mean I understand that really they pair of millions of dollars a year because of the shape of

over the place into cul de sac said men refine the main road the Washington Post has another one today there is a gubernatorial race taking place they the election as in less than a month and the state of Maryland the state of Maryland\nAnd uh there is a Republican governor there are by the name of Hogan and he is a Larry Hogan are very popular governor especially for a Republican in a very left the state of Maryland He is up over Ben Jealous the former president of the N. double ACP\nWhich represents the advancement of colored people and just don't call them colored people because that's racist people of color is okay but colored people is right out\nSo keep that in my ... Ben Jealous former president of the N. double ACP he's running against Larry Hogan Larry Hogan is up by twenty points\nWell Larry Hogan this campaign got a hold of some video a couple of different videos of Ben Jealous the liberal left wing Democrat I'm ...\nAnd he said some really stupid things on this on these these videos and Larry Hogan people made the public because you know you can laugh at the Democrat being an idiot and getting things wrong and sounding like a fool and that's all they're doing a showing video of him right\nSo and and he said stupid things he made gaffes mistakes but there are huge giant once so the Washington Post is downplaying but here's the headline\nAbout half of the Democratic party jealous accuses Hogan of bullying bullying because they are published videos of him looking stupid\nQuote a new low and Marilyn politics showing video of you is a new low in Maryland ... I I don't think that's true but it's what the Democrats say you know when a when they go low uh then they then they go lower I think that's I think that's the Democratic party saying is a\nMaryland Democrat gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous accused governor Larry Hogan of bullying which is a term that I think should be reserved for grammar school I think it's a grammar school term\nBullying him with the release of a new campaign video that mocks him for several gaffes they say gas they call 'em guess including one where he said he's running for governor of Virginia\nWhich in case you're a Democrat is a different state altogether that's another state altogether and so uh Ben Jealous or again he's a little brighter than Brooke Baldwin I think but not a lot\n[noise] we will be running together\nWe're hoping for the White House\nSaid well [noise] jealous when you make the president [noise]\nYou got to be the first black you know they're all in the next one day you will be on the governor of Virginia\nMaryland\nHe's been jealous for president then they cross it out of Virginia so they made a funny at and it's a funny ad can we post that we can post that on our website so you can enjoy it and share it with your friends now they didn't doctor the video like NBC News does they they just showed clips of him\nMaking a fool of themselves and then they've got a funny graphic at the end where it says Ben Jealous for president and they cross out president and then they write a Virginia\n[laughter] because they're mocking him now this is not allowed because he's a Democrat and now he's being bullied and guess what he's got a victim thing to fall back on he's got a victim thinks listen he's a victim he's the victim of all of this jealous set on Tuesday the mistakes were due to the soldier\nThat he has had since he was a child which at times it involves saying a different word that what he had a intended to say these ads are bullying jealous set at a news conference in Baltimore there\nWhile I can take it it encourages the bullying of young people and that's not okay he's protecting children and Planned Parenthood he loves to things children and Planned Parenthood it's a new low in Maryland politics let's not lose sight of who the victim is here it says\nOn Monday the ... campaign released a thirty three second video that highlights three gaps\nIn one part of the eclipse jealous says he's running to remove Hogan from the White House so it doesn't know what office he's running for\nIn another jealous says that if elected he would be the first black president\nAnd then in the ad there is a clip of Brock Obama throwing his hands up like you know what am I chopped a chicken made over here with us and in a certain segment recorded at an event on Saturday Ben Jealous tells union members that with their help quote you'll be you're looking at the next governor of Virginia\nSo I don't know I mean if you can't use that against them as a political ad that's the most polite political out I've ever seen that's not a new low it's a new high they see this is the old when they go low we go high and then they burn your car because there is a Trump a bumper sticker on it\nAnd uh it's amazing so listen to what he says here a stutter is like a speed bump\nWord replacement as a way that you deal with it and he's right one of my best friends growing up Jerry was I had a terrible stutter and he still has that he still has a daughter a ... a nice guy in the world when the greatest guys one of my lifelong best friends\nWith the center and it's true if you have a daughter and you start to start a year because you know you're going to start studying over a word like Maryland or something you know it started to say and I'm running for governor ...

not counter protesters they are an insurgency group an anarchist group and a police state to be more sort of early on to keep the peace\nTo defend like to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on once the crap hits the fan so to speak or then it's too late so\nI think a different strategy of more of a circus strategy by the Portland pd and all throughout the United states is necessary because we are at the stage now and I I've been seeing this for two or three months using the term political violence and people in the lift up and they laughed and said it was hyperbole no it's not now it's on and\nAs a patriot prayer group that was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago and it and to flip did the same damn thing they showed up prepared for battle they start fights they like conflict\nAnd like I said I'm the police are there to keep the peace not let this stuff happened not been but don't break those are failed strategies and until they make it clear\nWith a answer for that their antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protest because this is not protest and I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when a commentators I'm not talking about you but there are commentators\nAre on the right who continued to refer to what\nAnd it's a fun and some of this other political violence is when they're shutting down or an intimidating people in the restaurant they keep calling in protest it's not protest is insurgency answer for calls for the\nKilling of police officers they call for the down fall of the United states lawfully Institute of government\nWell and I know anyone who calls that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's\nIt's intimidation ah it's it's a type of\nOf political extortion too when they do it to the senators and and the elevators I\nKeep saying sheriff Clarke why this even allowed in the halls of the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to to get within a centimeter from someone else's face and scream at them and and they do in the halls of the uh the capital and actually even be allowed\nRight and but see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write you know senators and another congressman congresswoman too you know keep their decorum but then some of this is happening to private citizens for instance said Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the a\nPatriot prayer group or in Portland\nThis is happening to private citizens for instance said Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the a\nPatriot prayer group a in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to\nThat we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does it look like and I could tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they've you turn any other cheek\nTaking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness in like you said lawyer you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed to intimidate an insight fear in people to get them to alter their their votes for public policy that's why I'm calling this\nViolence it's gone on for too long it's gone too far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is good I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the\nThe anarchist movement that I studied to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and also know that what they learned out of the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned was that those soft measures just lead to more people getting hurt\nMore people getting killed more property damage and they ... I Would like to think that we learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes or in law enforced\nI agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment sheriff Clarke at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border or so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Donna Brazil on ABC's This week and and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and other\nThan that about mom [laughter] about people who do not want the health care about women who want to be listening to when they feel that it's time to talk about their prom a sexual assault maybe not about mob\nThat you're running and maybe that's what it would be about but when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV or talking about is about impeaching Brett Kavanaugh if I'm going to be seen Donald Trump I and the reason is taking the feel I agree with Rick Silva mob\nI eerie action to that\nPolicy about gun in Brazil you know but on Brazil\nOr not too long and we had a great conversation and she told me the true she said this stuff happening on the left is wrong she knows what's wrong with the they don't have the courage to call it out when I hear of people like her and I hear others not denounce\nThis violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage\nShe saw the backlash when she came out with her book that really took the or the DNC the Democratic party to test\nAnd she saw the felt the blowback ... she better scurry back on to the ... plantation and that's what she did at the end of her her a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership people in the Senate\nYou're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate means exhibit leadership was called this crap all for what it is to tell these people to knock it off but what they do Laura's you know or their tacit approval is\nComes from the silence and if they do say anything like they try to make that well it's not a mob it's really about health care no it's not she's trying to to frame of narrative\nAnd a ... everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they tried to uh\nWhen they're forced I should say to say that anti ... and some of these other goons this I'm a feminist movement when they're pulling their crap you know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence give tacit approval to this political violence\nOr and sheriff Clarke before we let you go ah the Democrat Stacey Abrams in other she's running for governor in Georgia\nSaying that they represent both documented and undocumented um people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claimed to represent a and now it's\nUndocumented um\nPeople in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claim to represent a and now we have this\nIs mad\nA crash about to happen again on the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because you know we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with the with children\nBy this is dangerous to continue they meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on this stuff she doesn't represent undocumented anybody or citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship and want citizenship means is that all the rights of privileges that\nAre in the constitution\nOr belong to the United states citizens not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing the the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nAnd again I'm this Congress must work with the president both on the wall and of course\nAllowing for immediate turned back at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening\nAnd it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America into this country I completely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there no one's in there and no one's going to make 'em leave\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment of truth that really is\nA terms of this administration I support the president's policies on immigration or illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not moved on this shame on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered opportunity who who knows what's gonna happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out\nThis elite is broken or immigration system to\nFinally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else that the people are proposing follows sealing the border because if you don't seal the border\nWe just saw last week we're still a guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen of beating has been deported six times lore six we've heard stories of people who have been caught that have been deported\nSorority times that's not a made a number but the ... the border is so poor as they're easily or they can easily get back and so now it's a matter of\nUm you know the eleventh hour and and I don't know we're going to maintain the house I I Hope when I say we the Jill ... I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're\nNot going to fix this immigration system they're going to give citizenship\nOr to some measure uh to illegal aliens amnesty I'm Talking about and you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that the Senate that will but at the same so we shouldn't be fighting the battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and I'll squandered two years for heaven's sakes with a very\nA strong\nPresident ... terms of sealing the border and immigration a broken immigration system they squandered it so this is what we're left with\nListen to that I Ramsey show eleven one for your chance to win a fair tickets has a bonus when one hundred dollars to more information at ...\nWho had the time to search endlessly for office\nAnd janitorial supplies at Gibson's office solutions\nWe've carefully thought to everything she don't have to do with ... delivery and product specialists on site where you're one step solution for office furniture workplace safety paper pen and ink cleaning products to coffee creamer it's all available for you all in one place\nVisitor Gibson's ... dot com or give us a call at six two to six seven three remember to shop locally owned by local at Gibson's office which is\nChief four o'clock traffic and whether together on a set during his sons morning new on two sons news and talk one ...

[laughter]\nBut the reason I called is 'cause I have a simple solution that everybody should be able to say yes Senator Warren if she is an American\nThen she should be able to join a one of the nation's or one of the tribes in North America which there's a process and they can go and apply and say my lineages this much of this time but I Want to be considered legally a number of this try if she can find a tribe or nation\nIn this country that will accept her and said that she has been knocked Indian blood then we can all say okay you're an Indian but I'd be willing to bet in the next couple of paychecks not a good ...\n... ... you you don't have to bet anything because already the Cherokee Nation just respond to be said to Elizabeth Warren today you're undermining tribal interests there like telling her stop it just stop it now I mean at some point I got I can let you go Ken output plead the fifth on that so I'm here's the thing what [laughter]\nYeah that's a big fat no vote
