[laughter] my my comment was I'm Joe I listen to you for many many years I'm Glad I I really like to hear\nPeople cracking down on this war criminal George so hospitable for all the division in America he finds all the left and on and many of the rights of the nation\nAnd um\nLook like the deal with Kanye West\nThey man has a right to choose is ice cream if he wants to know ice cream chocolate I if he if he wants to vote for the man he likes he has that opportunity that's what freedom is about like freedom is it just another word if that means nothing if ... if he can't vote for who he wants to name free but George Soros isn't under boss\nCause us Federal Reserve that Asian on her boss he's a war criminal\nRight he's held up and down the back of the day you laughed about it on sixty minutes oh the guy is not a good guy you should not have those kind of influence\nNo and he shouldn't be allowed to donate money for for these these candidates\nAnd this this is the I mean we've been lied to our whole lives and ... and Joe I got to tell you this when I hear this I just laugh a fair to save raise the interest rates I go the hands you know a lot of fans are you talking about the Federal Reserve there no more federal than them now and then Disney World\nBut you don't mind a misnomer the fact that they have this kind of power as much to me\nIt ... it was the president says the fed has going loco\nLoco yeah a movie and then so since they're on this video I guess we all need to play back to really see the king what what are we talking about\nHis there I mean we got two different games here were playing and that's the problem or they're not gonna take America there's too many strong people here are used for all this crap up in Portland, Oregon it's going on now are these ... at least be banned and team of leans that that have nothing to do that are paid by shows that are kicking lemon into space that\nAre just trying to make their way to work blocking cars that guy that made a bad rock right turn they bust they dragged him out of the car beat him up with baseball bats I got\nI got news for the ... the nation here I'm a hell's angel supporter\nAnd I sent a a word out\nTo one of my brothers shoes and vice president okay no and I asked him that sense and brothers down to Portland and just drive around at night\nOkay and and in these areas and and and watch what happens if one of these ... little leagues or even spit on these angels bikes and then watch and then what you ... watch what's going to happen because he's\nI guess what the media which may be bad hole the hell's angel started the trouble having a little bit like a broken up the phone or ...\nWhat's going to happen I guess\nWhat the media would say about how the hell's angel started the trouble that when I look at like\nA broken up the phone or if you're not going to do this because as green as I was on\nMy sister over there is ... ... that he had a good call so I Want to let him get out what he wanted to say\nWhat do you definitely was get Rick on the phone call and I saw an eight eight eight nine four one eighty nine for once every three or four Seventy Joe packs dot com when we come back it'd be chirping candidate for the house of representatives he's going for Twenty one of the great state of Texas happens to be the district ...\nAnd you got an interesting perspective he's also the former campaign chair for Ted Cruz was a lot of\nRespect to the left versus\nTwo or three or four Republican seats if things go away it looks right now the house bill is a toss up ... what are your feelings on this I feel confident you're going to win but I Want them reading who's who's in this area to go and vote either early voting on election day don't don't take anything for granted but I feel confident that you're going to win\nWhat's it going to take to ensure that you've got a\nHouse of representatives that doesn't go the wrong way and the wrong way is just what you said no more tax cuts in fact let's repeal them I'm an Obama Care it's going to stay put let's impeach the president let's impeach cabin uh it it I don't know what the hell they're running on getting them any traction but um what what is it that you could say right none of those watching and listening across the country that would ensure\nThat the conservative base that you and I want to get out there gets out there\nI'll tell you I've been out going across the district talking to people nonstop for the last ten months in particular the last several and I can tell you the enthusiasm over the last two to three weeks in light of that sort of the show I represent a minute ago in the Senate committee is extraordinary\nThe American people particularly here in Texas really fed up with what they're seeing out of the Democrat left a progressive agenda that's completely out of lockstep with everything they believe are Texas values run deep that's why would they are moving to Texas and while governor having his right to joke about building a fence on our western or the borders and\nThe reality is it's like a woman I talked to and burning just down the road from where you live the other day came up to Michigan and nice contributions that ship you've got her when they make sure that we control the house of the Texas protected you know I got nowhere else to move and I just moved here from California two weeks ago yeah\nWe'll get it they understand that the opportunity you have in Texas to thrive in a ... hat prospering to pass something down your kids are so great so I feel optimistic I Can't predict what's gonna happen in the house that this much right now in taxes we had a million Democrats show up for the first time in the primaries in March\nBut as you know and you talked on your show about a million and a half Republican showed up yeah\nYou are job than taxes will send a message not just the taxes and the rest of the country but to the world that we're going to continue to be the vanguard for liberty and make sure that we are not just expand the Senate hold the house and then get busy a truly taking advantage of this opportunity with a president willing to challenge the status quo\nIt's a chip Roy C. H. I. V. last tomorrow why go and vote for him district Twenty one he's running for ah Lamar Smith Lawrence had Betsy for over Thirty years or what's interesting is that you brought up the Kavanaugh hearings a couple of times and that's important because\nUh when the economy is so good and we've got more money in the bank and we're going out to eat more often were spending more money at at a big box stores and we're seeing these numbers are off the charts people get fat and happy\nAnd they're not why would I go and vote things are going great but I don't think they realize\nThat the the ramifications the consequences if they don't get off their hands and go and vote do you think the Democrats chip overplay their hand in the Senate Judiciary committee I Am Spartacus and interrupting and yelling and screaming and bringing up allegations that are uncorroborated debate just light a fire under Democrats are under Republicans\nI really believe that they let a fire under Republicans frankly was badly needed for the reasons you start taking like Republicans were getting a little bit set and saying well we're doing well this is great\nYou know and they're kind of in that mid term diligent and the Democrats did a better job of anybody and lighting and fire and a Republican by overreaching and not just over reaching in the Senate Judiciary committee where they definitively did an unfairly and undermine the process and unfair to comment on primarily an\nOscar for yeah they overreach but it's also the overreach by candidates candidates like Beto O'Rourke candidates like my opponent in the Texas Twenty one who are running as a valid ... progressive socialist on agendas that are about impeaching Trump higher taxes more spending less horror security for\nVowed ... progressive socialist on agendas that are about impeaching Trump higher taxes more spending less horror security for government run health care for more gun restrictions for more funding for Planned Parenthood\nMy opponent has all of that on his website you don't have to take my word for it and I would encourage anybody listening go looking back on its website is it is and vowed progressive liberal Democrat and they overreach because they thought\nThey could drive for a this midterm election with progressive policy and Texans like they always do are going to stand up and say not in our back yard we love freedom\nGiven how does anybody shifted to that's a winning combination I I Am I'm open to abolishing ice let's open the border I'm Robert Francis workout I'm calling about the whatever nickname he's calling himself he's not Hispanic he was a fourth generation Irish American nothing wrong with that but he's on the bumper stickers only say PTO which doesn't make sense to me um this guy actually\nSaid and there's a piece of video that I saw just yesterday some time ago he said we're basically stole half of Mexico from them\nI mean this is this is what you're dealing with how is it a winning combination to to proud Texans how is it a winning combination of proud Americans who really believe that we're a sovereign nation and it's OK love our nation\nYou know it's definitively not a winning combination I think that's why we're seeing the recent polls for Senator Cruz him and and now getting back up to a leading role in the eight nine ten point lead right\nIn New York Times poll and ms online poll and others and I think we're going to see that hopefully across the state and across the country I think they were betting on the fact that they had some sort of\nAnti Trump mid term ability to galvanize their forces into drive out two thousand sixteen turn out with you know people like levels that came out for a Hillary Clinton on the other side of the aisle I Will say this is a caution to all your listeners\nIf we do our job as conservative Americans conservative Texans and show up to vote across the country not just here and we just you've got a conservative choice\nWe'll do fine but there are banking on Republican staying home and Democrats turning up in ways so they ran a hardcore progressive drive out their base agenda that out a lockstep with the vast majority of Americans and I hope that overreach will shine clear\nIt's ... I Believe he's the only choice in December Twenty one for a United States house of representatives ... last last question\nAre you like beating your ... center left people some people blue dog Democrats are just as happy as\nThe rest of us are about the economy just as happy about the direction of our country and and but it's okay to wave of American flag and say usa usa usa again I mean we're really talking about a far left\nFringe Alyssa Milano Beto O'Rourke bought a bronco bomber sort of of left that thinks that everything that's going on his bed right I mean you know Democrats you know blue dogs I mean these people actually\nQuietly are going I'm going to vote the way the way it is to keep it the way it is because things are going pretty well\nThere is no question I've ... I've seen that throughout the district and throughout the state is I've been told that they are they're really turned off by this sort of anti American feel if they know what the the politics are behind it we saw it as I mentioned in the Kavanaugh hearings and they're and they're kind of retrenching a bit and saying look you know I I'm not comfortable with that importantly Joe you'll agree with us I think\nI Believe that we've got an impressive moment and opportunity right now to re enough unify our country around our shared belief system that the federal government should\nBe small and state governments and people in power if you want to unite our country and then stop one size fits all solution is washing\nLet taxes be taxes like California Beach California so we won't be in each other's throats and the escalating politics so you're not watching meet the press with bated breath about what Washington is going to do for us to do what we knew best in Texas live our own lives and we're not telling everybody what to do then we won't be at each other's throats\nYou're actually suggested as a temp amendment that says we can do our own thing to a job I appreciate you I I I appreciate your candor to see um\nThen we won't mean each other's throats that you're actually suggesting there's a tenth amendment that says we can do our own thing to a chip I appreciate you I appreciate your candidacy I'm Glad that you're the guy and I think that when you get to\nTo to the house of representatives and listening watching in this district need to go and vote out when you get there I think we're going to carry the torch very well for this district what'd\nYou thank you for that they get more to do and your listeners please you get your friend shocked about let's make sure we send a strong message was not just went by little let's went by a lot and not get busy in Washington dealing with that we would do and make this country great again\nDi ... we back after this and the Joe ...

I thought it was um house negro but it was that he was token negro ... by three black people on a panel on CNN not ... not many people watch CNN so when they do something like this any trends that actually gives them eyeballs the otherwise wouldn't get\nBut it's it's it's to be a\nIt's truly an attempt by the left to get people like cutting you back in line how dare you step out get dressed back in the plantation and you do what we say that's really what I see happening\nSo stick around bottom yard will be I'm sure David Clark retired Milwaukee County Wisconsin we always appreciate his inside um meantime to the phone lines we would have been people think about the food stuff in England I'm not against they hate it\nSo we're we're gonna we're gonna do that um first of all I Want to go to Massachusetts in grant on line one grant what's going on high\nHey Joe hey how you doing limited dream it\nGreat um I was going to make a comment about the right of um Americans are\nParents for his children but it's really like to talk about the food thing\nThat we can do whatever you called in about if it's a free speech broadly whatever you want to talk about\nOkay yeah I ... on it\nAnd I just recently just turned sixteen and I'm resigning medical and and the health care documents and they will not release papers to the school to various places without my sixteen year old signing the hate this\nWhy now for some reason\nThat they that this isn't Massachusetts or that if this is in other states um I did not have it right my child at sixteen because he can make yourself a slice of tell us okay so yeah we have\nA yeah I I don't understand the control of it this way where I don't have the rights of my own children well\nThat is not the case here in Texas I'm a I'm going to I'm going to jump in a that's not the case in Texas and it's clearly this must be a state by state thing I Would get a hold of your of your local representative I ... I get older your mayor I get a hold of everybody you could and ask you a very simple question if I'm responsible for this person until he's Eighteen and you are\nThen why exactly what you need his signature on anything he's not he's not an adult you can sign a contract was Eighteen he can't legally do that you can't buy a car to Lee's Eighteen or you get something for an apartment until he's Eighteen why would he have control over his own medical records when yours that\n\nThey're very very weird my wife couldn't believe that um so he didn't even know what he's doing he had to sign a paper because we we started new schools and he had to change doctors he had to sign the papers we had no control the situation whatsoever\nThat sounds I'd say I I'm gonna get with my friends have come under who's on on wor K O to ask you what he knows about that I Am not an expert on Massachusetts law but but that's not a federal thing that's something that the president or the legislature can change clearly Massachusetts made that decision for itself 'cause again where I sit in Texas that isn't like that\nThat's that's\nWe're the legislature can change clearly Massachusetts made that decision for itself because again why should in Texas it isn't like that\nThat that's good to know because I was really close and I just thought what are they doing trying to control the kids I mean ... even ... vote in the kids I just I don't know what's going on\nWith their child should not have the right you should have the rights unless there's some abused or something like that but it doesn't sound like that's the situation on\nThe other yeah oh what a great but I appreciate it stop at the fake actually an open line now at eight eight eight nine for what\nReally how do you think because I asked you to do the accent and grand thought he would call him vacant accent or ... you know how I knew it was half Australian half English [laughter] pick one Grand Isle wow dead he's never going to kind\nOf you know that was not a fake actually you just don't like he was high but I'm the ... one of these ID so much it sound like a lover English accent it was a British accent\nYou notice him like he was up ... a little bit and I don't believe that here's our house\n... ... [laughter]\nYou know written a grant Roxanne I got to tell you that opened my eyes a lot about what's going on in Massachusetts I'm Sorry tennis but he's facing that I Will ask my friend joked lunar\nUh with the story is how exactly would it be in a in a state in the United states of America where I Know that you're responsible for your child does Eighteen that you'd have to get him to sign a release to allow a school to seize medical records what the\nI mean ever heard of that around not too wild legitimately doesn't make any sense does it does not you didn't goes real accent though I Am getting senior\nAren't you section of reading uh eighty nine for one pack let me go to I'm a lawyer Mike is an apple valley in California Mike what do you think about the foods that the food bleach in England\nI think they're completely insane to things are okay if they make a little smaller pizza with less calories they just try to\nMatch the exactly right I gotta quit I got to listen to let me stop you when they did that stupid rule in I'm In New York about how much sugar you could have in your drink and what can I buy ten so does or not you're like well yes but you can only because they said you can have it you're gonna sugary drink but it can't be more than sixteen\nOunces so I get by for six you know if I Want but I Can't have one sixty ... W E sense\nIn the second part they're going to generate more trash or plastic wrapping because you're a little bit bigger pizza would take less of that type of stuff into little pieces\nIt might be making listen he makes a perfect point Kerry if I go to the beach boys and say look I'm looking to do about Eighteen hundred calories tonight and they're like well there's if you only have six hundred let\nMe give me a very ... why can't I Do that you well you can just these rules make new friends\nI think a lot of black folks knee jerk react and say I need to be against what he's doing because he's standing by that President\nIf they actually shut up and listen for a second they might get it right\nWell let's face it and come up with that lives on less than their to their talking points from the left you know\nAll the plantation owners as you say a gun you had the nerve to wander off the plantation I did it a long time ago yeah and this is going to get this is the hate you're going to get I still get on a daily basis but I don't care about that one of the other dangerous as if you make it about people\nOr they could destroy the movement very easily by taking orders leader so we can make is just about Kanye West just about David ... about\nA candidate so and we have to make this about a lot of people which is why I like it I said the more the merrier but at the same time we have to develop an agenda and we have to have the will tabulate to be able to articulate that is in in the black community you know I'm close to the camera\nIn the black community at ground level that looked like they want to hear the issues that are important to them that will make them say you know what to do the party is doing anything for us this party over here look interesting let me give them a chance that they did the job Donald Trump after he said hey image chance what are you got the\nAmericans share of dot com going good his book come under fire its former sheriff David Clarke Milwaukee County retired um is it going to take more people like you and the others that you mentioned and here's the reason why I ask is going to make this comparison all the time because I think it's valid Tiger Woods playing golf at a very high level the best golfer in the world for a long time\nActually told young black kids in the inner city I can play professional golf right to play golf\nOh for the world for a long time actually told young black kids in the inner city I can play professional golf right to play golf isn't going to take more people actually seen black folks like you and others in the community saying\nLook you don't have to be here you don't have to think this is this has to be your life yes you can get out of the slums or the the projects or or or the ghetto\nOr is it going to take that because it seems to be ... or all of us were little were impressionable by by these mentors and these idols that we have if you're watching the guy driving the b._m._w. with the with the gold teeth in his mouth who's selling drugs on the corner you want to grow up in the bad guy you're on the line from David Clarke you want to be a very different guy\nCertainly the plurality you know and that's one of the things that's been lacking a plurality of voices which is why I said at the value of Kanye West ... we need different segments of this community look like they were no different than anybody else and that ... visual creatures we want to see as their strongest sense is our\nEyes we want to see that these things are possible that was the whole with the election of resident Brock Obama down for black people then yeah you know what America has moved on America's gonna give us opportunities but then ... squandered it so a guy like Tiger Woods\nYeah pretty good role models you know in terms of responsibility or you know he's raising his kid knows where it's called are you know it's not a perfect world yeah but he didn't affect his kids over that and then he has a responsibility being in that position like myself like Conway west cognac keep calling comic Kanye West\nAnd others to you know to free so to speak to develop that narrative and encourage the courage to these young people\nIn these ghettos that life can be different but it starts with you it starts with you taking control it starts with you make it better lifestyle choices that's Tiger Woods is talking about but then again you know it's going to get shot down you know tiger's a solo artist so with the cello were also no we're not\nWe want to help people this is not about us staying with me it was a billionaire yeah look I made it to the top of my profession uncle pretty good life you know\nA copy west develop this this music thing and and even this isn't about us we know that this is about people who are aspiring people who need a positive message will need real or not that also that Obama brought and so like I said we have responsibility that goes along with it the more the merrier\nIt is a sharp David Clarke America's sheriff dot com get his book\nCome under fire if it's a really important ... don't want you to go check it out what's interesting is you have you and and as you said ... and ... you know you've got people who are loud voices who happened to be black Americans who understand traditional American values that are trying to bring that to the next generation on on the on the flip side you've got idiots like Don Lemon\nAnd a panel of of losers on CNN\nActually daring to call Kanye West\nA house negro he's out there a way to try to get him back on the plantation what do they hope to achieve by saying something so disgusted\n... up to that diminishes branch of the ministers profile or the slanted like that they did the same thing to me it doesn't work it really does and you have to stay strong it'll be interesting to see it if a Kanye will stay stronger when they start\nDrifting back or the other side of record sales starts falling off of um you know the Hollywood industry starts to shut immediately get invited to the parties and what not\nIt'll be interesting to see if he hangs on but I Hope he does because you know I Hope he's thinking like meat and then about us more about the ... if he gets the red carpet affairs and and how many uh records he still is not about that it's about helping other people in these first himself into this good for him\nBut he's in the bathroom or now with that 'cause responsibility so he got to be careful because\nOther people in the east coast himself into this good for him but he's in the bathroom or now with that comes responsibilities so he's got to be careful because what they're waiting on the left\nIs they're waiting for er into misstep we set a couple of things that sound a little clumsy\nYou know it was just mentioned about about seeing the thirteenth man and I know what he meant most people do as well right now but that's why you have to develop that a cat vocabulary so that they don't seize on those opportunities but this is what they do they go out to get down to limit who's a buffoon by the way I chopped them up\nYou did [laughter] on national TV during the convention yeah but they go out they could see the end they gotta get others to get\nDone in Brazil for him and say you know I met her and I had a very nice conversation with her she gets it she knows this is a sham by the Democrats by the left would seem to have the courage to step away from him\nSo they can get ... it's like them to to to do know how to go I'm just going to waste late because that's how the the the tournament I I'm not to read that they just run away they bring them back to the plantation\nDeliver good beating so that not only does she know but others who saw this go oh man I don't want that to happen to me and and that's just literally happened the runaway slaves when they were captured yeah bought back to sleep in front of the other slaves that they wouldn't try this\nAnd that's why you got to stand strong\nI got a lot of scarring a lot of scar tissue what the left as on the me over the last ten years I've been involved in this woman was strong behind George W. Bush when it wasn't popular to be right and you know endorse him in ... in his uh election and was involved with things for him in the conservative movement\nSee I didn't make it about George W. Bush made it about conservativism and I made about the conservative movement we have to keep focused on\nThe movement and and not so much I'm ...\nI'm just about out of time one more quick question from Russia erupt in park America's sheriff dot com go they're also get his book under fire a very important rebuilt follow him on Twitter just to make ... you get to a million yet but we're still\nPushing as hard as we can last a whole bunch of ... you probably did to talk about the next time I just think that they're purging people whatever accounts having said that do you believe the numbers that thirty six percent support now\nFrom the African American community for Donald Trump\nOr you know I had no reason not to believe it but the thing is we don't know how that it's going to translate into votes yeah one thing is that people say they support it's another thing to have them go out and actually pull the lever\nFor the other side I think we'll find out a lot\nIn the midterms you know Donald Trump president's office none of the gender but his policies are ... ... s as I saw a number of the other day I think it was this morning it was two hundred and thirty nine or social successes during the short selling you especially in the United states that's phenomenal that they'll stand it it's going to take time so these folks that are\nYou know involved in this that are new like Khan a and cat has got to be patient with it\nYou know this just walk away movement okay that's a ... and and that's the message but they can expect success overnight because you're talking about decades you're talking about a half a century of black people voting Democrat you're going to put that in one or two elections\nYeah I agree with you it's America's sheriff dot com get his book is

E. N. C. E. R. S. the NFC more come on spell S. E. N. S. E. and does it make dollars and cents C. E. N. T. S.\nTo pay the taxes they get it over with and put it some place where it will grow\nAnd you can access it tax free and none of it shows up on your ten forty four\nWe have talked about this but very few people here as my contention very few people think that what I'm Talking about today is going to happen they go you know what mark I haven't seen it we've been hearing about this the the uh the Congress keeps kicking the can down the road you know what this really isn't going to happen folks how much longer\nDo you think we can go on printing money\nIn golf they call it um all again when you you take a shot and then you know hit it and it was a rough or he hid it in the water well we're going to give you a mole again we're going to allow you to take another shot at it well that's what really Trump is done by giving us these lower tax rates and postponing some of this stuff down the road in ... until maybe another\nGroup of people get in and they said we need to ... raise the rates again we need to really tightened are built but you know what it's not polluted politically expedient for people to do this it doesn't gain them favor with with their constituency so what do you do as an individual well number one you're doing\nA really good thing today listening to this show number two you can pick up the phone and give us a call and say mark you've talked about this and ... what do I do we're going to get into the hard meat and potatoes of this thing here a little bit certainly in a second portion of our show give us a call two nine six four four six four go onto the Web\nAsked for the packet that we've\nBeen given out for months and months and months\nBecause it's so important it it it contains all the information that you want to know about\nRight at all the different articles mark what's that that part that packet is called the optimize their packet I keep adding articles and articles more articles are going into it that support and substantiate where we are going\nAs a nation\nWe are headed folks towards what's called a ... a sovereign debt crisis this fiscal gap and and I read this article and the gentleman is saying look we are headed towards insolvency ... is that it not sobering or what if we are headed towards\nWe are headed towards insolvency ... is that not sobering or what\nIf we are headed towards insolvency it means to re boot we're gonna have to change everything that we do we're going to have to dramatically increase taxes that's why I say if you can pay the tax today and get it over with\n\nI eat and then where do I put the money trust in where do people put the money if they pay the tax and they get it over with\nHe's thinking about their wallets and then what do they\nDo with it what vehicle might they put in and take a really hard stand yes in this thing I'm going to guess when through life insurance very young and that that could be one of the vehicles or into a Roth IRA certainly anything where you can pay the tax get it over with and then all the gross that's that's in those vehicles\nIs all yours if you stop and you think about is it possible that all going to go out on a limb here that it's\nIt has been immoral for advisors to tell people to put money into four one K. plans and for all three B plans and IRAs and so forth\nWhy is because it's not\nIt's a different role but really the word that makes the most sense is it is a postponement they are asking you to postpone paying the tax when you are in historically low rates\nTo a time when you are probably going to be in the highest tax bracket ever for you and your family does that make sense\nI had this conversation the other day and I can't even believe were\nLess than three minutes we got to take a a little break here in the show but think about a four one K. plant where the government is saying you can\nTake a deep Dutch and today on your contribution and oh by the way you're going to be taking on all the risk of that money market jumps market ... you know plummets you're going to yes you get the game but you also but there's little catty out to that but you're also going to take me taking on all the risk if that market plummets\nYou\nThe listener the one that has that for one that for all three be that simple IRA that set plan you're taking on all the risk but then when you get out to retirement look at all the potential growth fats in that account the government is saying thank you for taking on all of that risk but now we want to share and all that gain\nFolks is that fair you've taken on all the risk now they're asking you to share in\nWhat you did that roller coaster ride and hopefully that account is gain some money they're now saying they want to participate in that\nIs that fair I don't think it is so let's step back what have you paid the tax the you got it over with you said look\nMark I agree I I Believe what you're saying is true I Am going to take that money today pay the tax on it and I'm going to put it into something like a whole life insurance policy or I'm going to put it into a Roth or some type\nAnd then all of that game all of that is yours\nNone of that to declare rubble there is no longer a postponement you've taken on that risk today by paying the tax which there's very little risk if we are technically in a in a bracket\nThat is going to be the lowest of your lifetime but all of that gain all that growth the government is not going to participate in its all yours ooh let's rub our hands together yeah it's all mine it's all mine look at what exactly see that's what the government hasn't told you it's a postponement and they are having you postpone that money to a point in time\nExactly see that's what the government hasn't told you it's a postponement and they are having you postpone that money to a point in time where they're going to need it desperately probably the most desperate they've ever been because of where we're going this thing we call a fiscal cliff folks it's common you know the biggest threat to our national security\nIs not the borders it's our national debt think about that for a second the biggest threat to our national security is our national debt\nIf that's not so bring if that doesn't Silvio if you're not thinking oh my goodness mark\nWhat do I do well you call us let us help\nYou get on the right track two nine six four four six for my cell two three five nine for six five trust and I can't believe the first portion of the show is over you didn't want to stay tuned for the next portion of our show because this is where we really dialing out what you can do because the math\nThree point four trillion dollars were we going to come up with that money if everybody said oh we you know health care free for all the let's wipe away all the student debt\nLet's do this let's do that well look folks the current budget of the U.S government is currently around four point two trillion dollars that's the current budget so what's the deficit\nThe deficit is we're not bringing we're bringing in a million less than a trillion I'm Sorry we are bringing in a trillion less than that\nMedicare for all would be estimated costs three point six trillion dollars you know a little bad here a little ... billion here a billionaire a trillion here now you're starting argue starting to talk about some real money\nIf you throw in Social Security defense interest on the debt intentions at all levels of government the cautious now over ten trillion dollars looked at the gross domestic product of our country is only twenty trillion mathematically all the numbers I just read would destroy\nOur economy so what does all this what does this mean for you the individual if all those numbers are just like gobbledygook and you're thinking what in the world is this even mean it means let's talk about you and your family\nWhat can we\nDo to help you and your family I Would like to say here's a solution to the economy to our country as a whole that would mean probably getting rid of all of Congress in getting economists in there who really know what's going on we know that's not going to happen so what can you do here in Tucson\nArizona in southern Arizona what can you can pick up the phone you can cause you say mark you're talking a lot about this stuff what can I conceivably do today\n... is it and I want to talk about this I Hope today can I even take advantage of bad stuff when it happens when the markets plummet yes you can take advantage of that ... what we can talk about this maybe not today I'm going to maybe touched on it but definitely next week\nSo folks the Social Security Medicare programs are currently running negative cash flow numbers that means that we are paying out more benefits than they are receiving in revenue\nYou know we've heard this time and time again the problem is everybody is super busy we are all running at a million miles an hour we get our information in Fifteen second news bites right little things here a little things there we don't hear the whole story was on\nAll the all wow that ooh look at look at the market's up booths look at how folks\nAs Paul Harvey used to say don't you want to know the rest of the story do you really want to know what's going on\nIf today at the end of the show you simply to remember what mark said about ... ... low\nRates historically low tax rate maybe I Need to start thinking about paying the tax today\nAnd putting time on your side\nFolks Tyne is not on your side when you are postponing a tax liability that's on the side of the government that's not on your side yet most of us unfortunately have bought off hook line and sinker into\nPutting money into for a one case for oh three bees\nTraditional i._r._a. set simple we have been taught that\nBy Wall Street our government has said hey we will give you a deep ducks in today and you can differ that no you can post\nOur government has said hey we will give you a deep ducks in today and you can de for that no you can't postpone what isn't it possible\nIt's inevitable that you're going I Believe it's inevitable you're going to be at a higher tax rate when you get into retirement do you want to even take that chance I Would think I Would hope you would say no so as I said earlier I Believe it's\nEven deceptive for many advisors and look if I have somebody comes in and they are adamant about mark I want to set up a for one I Want to set up an IRA look I'm not going to argue with him but I give them\nThe hard and cold fact so where do you put the money first and imagine if you pay the tax today where can you put the money to wear all grows free of income tax\nDown the road think about it just really hard for a second I you're smiling so I kinda think you kinda sorta no\n\nTake a look at the ... you're shaking your head say have you not been listening to the show every week that I did that I Do it or do you avoid actress and come on now work with me here it's gotta be some sort of policy it kind of policy I don't know what do you mean you don't know man you ride again\nA life insurance policy that's where you should be putting it why because of all the advantages look\nI don't folks I don't want you to die that's not why we're buying this thing we want you to live we want you to enjoy all the living benefits I had a a gal come in a last week and she was she was very concerned about some monies that she had been a\nCreditor and predator protected ooh that interests you like that creditor imprinted are protected that's what life insurance as the cash valleys any good whole life insurance policy or creditor and predator\nProtected\nThey help you when it comes to long term care they help you when it comes to critical illness they help you when it comes to maybe having to pull somebody out to keep your business afloat or to pay that bill that unexpected medical bill where is the money going\nTo come from your life insurance policy and again\nWhen the real crash finally hits in I Believe that's coming I Believe this suit nominee is coming and think about it when when the crash finally hits and everybody wants to get out of all their stocks and bonds and their mutual funds in their ... and real estate and all their commodities\nWhere we'll where will they get the money for the all these redemption wherever this money is held where are those folks going to get the money who's going to buy all of these assets when everybody wants to sell 'em\nThere's not necessarily going to be a market for them life insurance on the other end has always been liquid during all the economic\nDisasters that have ever been around I think about that you the listener have inability to take advantage of opportunities I said this a minute ago and here I'm getting right to it to take advantage of economic disasters\nFolks please listen here in a society where everyone is always suing everyone think about that ... right everybody wants to sue for this for the everybody's a victim\nDo you believe it should be some of your assets should be protected against this sort of attack I Believe they should be so life insurance\nIs not just all about you dine in you leaving tax free dollars to somebody that helps out a lot to this\nThe life insurance is not just all about you dying and you leaving tax free dollars to somebody that helps out a lot to the survivors and we can give you first hand stories and accounts of\nPeople who have really benefited from receiving tax free life insurance dollars but let's talk about you living let's talk about you\nTaking a portion of those funds and when the markets have sunk to all time low as you get back into mark is that possible yes so here's some questions are going to go kind of jump around a little\nBit here but here's some questions because it's a we believe it more financial strategies\nAnd you can give us a call if this is resonating with you'd only Mark I'm never something to talk on the radio like this before\nWill come into the office in the conversation will continue will will pick right up where we left off here on

Michael doorman on one [noise]\nGood afternoon what an extraordinary week happening\nThis country and in the world\nAre we all have seen the news of the horrific storms that just seemed to come out of nowhere and I've been reading the bottom line listening to all sorts of different sources saying that that could be a weather weapon\nAlso we have a really the left wing is becoming more and more violence as Hillary Rodham Clinton\nAluminium body henchmen Eric Holder ...\nOpenly now calling for violence and they seem to never get in trouble\nBut he henchmen Eric Holder ...\nOpenly now calling for violence and they seem to never get in trouble\nAnd there's all sorts of circumstances out there that were reading about where the left is openly calling for violence and they want violence they want they desire it\nAnd I just want to I I Want to I Want to kind of show some things here a billionaire Minecraft creators says that the left has literally been taken over by evil\nLiterally been taken over by evil as a very powerful statement and I think it is now there is more doubt proof than ever as we are approaching these mid term elections\nAlso it was a Camille picky a who is a feminist who is who is known to be on the left she has come out and said that feminism is the collapse of western civilization this is an atheist\nI was listening to this conversation uh where where she was a really quoting this\nAnd she ... modern day feminism has turned into\nMale hatred is basically what it is we have Leon here or protect contributing to show what ... what what have you been watching with the left what are other uh people speaking about it um things that we've been hearing about in the media\nWhere is really what it is what is the status of the mid term elections\nWell you know it is interesting because we are watching aren't we for the October surprise\nThe elections are less than four weeks away everybody knows that the left is going to try some kind of a dramatic surprise coming up here that is going to make Trump look bad that it's going to make people want to vote Democrat\nNow is is the hurricane part of that plan is the the drop in the stock market the last couple of days part of that plan\nUh we we have to be very cautious wait for something to watch for something here which is going to they're going to try to shock us\nInto thinking that that Trump and his supporters are are bad our failures are are wrong did you notice you know you mentioned this with a vis feminist\nAnd did you notice there was a story here just today yesterday about a a Trump supporter at the rally in Erie, Pennsylvania a pro life trumps borders was outside the arena\nAnd uh she was threatened by a leftist an older man who said I have the right to repeal\n[noise] and there were other feminist evidently and the protest or group that immediately rushed to his defense against a pro life Trump supporting woman\nNow is that evil or what well yeah and there again there's this double standard if we agree with you our beliefs matter ... ... ...\nIf this it if the right wing is going to become a victim while they're fat that's not that's not how they see it if we are fighting the right wing than an hour than the act of rape than the act of theft than the act of hatred\nThan the act of sabotage then that's all okay but if it is someone that we don't like who does that all all of a sudden they're Islamic phobic as all of a sudden they're racist I have a sudden they're sexist edge\nLike who does that all all of a sudden they're Islamic phobic\nOh as all of a sudden they're racist I have a sudden they're sexist is just this double standard this continual hypocrisy I was listening Joe Rogan\nOn his podcast and I he I find that very interesting because when it comes to us see he's really really smart I mean he tells it like it is but when it comes to politics he really doesn't know what's going on yet he comments about it\nAnd uh I think he is the perfect example of kind of this mainstream America opinion because they're too he brings on a lot of ... and they talk how a Trump is wrong and something's gonna happen that's going to expose them at the same time\nUh he was bringing up the case where in California they're starting to bring in legislation to where if a woman even drinks if she is drunk or if she's even ... she can declare rape and he's like whoa\nWhoa wait a second this is turned into lunacy the left wing is turning into lunacy because now you're seeing any couple if the girl had\nAnd with the Kanye West a trip to the White House\nAh definitely those people are getting the attention that they deserve even though the left is trying to screen foul and hatred and and oh how dare they do this to my White House and I'd love to see a Donald Trump bringing Alex Jones the White House and have them have a little conversation as well as Matt Drudge\nAs well as uh the guys from Breitbart and ... my low and the rest of them\nI think that'd be an interesting discussion right there in the uh\nRight there in the oval office bring bring them all in and just let the left explode and they would they would absolutely explode as we see here in the news this last week\nThis come from infowars Obama activates has domestic army to carry a terrorist attacks a former attorney general directly orders Democrat democratic troops to engage in violence the left is becoming increasingly violent as they prepare for a mid term temper capture him and that's absolutely right what a\nEric Holder said was as they go low\nWe kick them so forget about as they go low we go high that was their old slogan and it's not that the\nRight went low it's just that they disagreed with them they think that if you disagree with them they're lose you lose your moral standard uh no that's not the case uh it's the left wing that has gone back crap crazy and they are in hysteria and they they they kept totally taken their eyes off\nThe real thing that they should be concerned about and that is\nThe destruction of the United states dollar by the Federal Reserve and furthermore really again I I always go back to that point is the left wing thinks that they're the resistance they're not the resistance mainstream media agrees with you the one percent of one percent Wall Street agrees with you [noise]\nBig pharma agrees with the military industrial complex agrees with you the education duster and complex agrees with you all\nOf the status Mitt politicians agree with you when does human beans and\nWhen those corporations agree with you you're not the resistance your the resistance to the resistance Trump is the resistance Kanye West is the resistance Alex Jones is the resistance and it's been proven that the resistance I left you are nothing more\nThan useful idiots once you get used up\nThen they'll discard you and throw you in the FEMA capital is going to be too late because you will have no resources at that point you've probably already your energy is going to be depleted because you're going to try to launch a war with the right wing it's not going to work\nIt's not going to work in a God Forbid it go hot to do you understand that the current military and the foreign military there right wing or it's the n._r._a. who has all the guns are right wing or the police the former police the right wing us okay you're going to be funny and those people okay you're not going to when\nYou're not going to win so just get it out of your mind there is no winning here the only way you're going to win as a left wing or it could come back to your senses and say I need to protect civil liberties I Need to speak out against the one percent of one percent forget about Republicans forget about right wing or forget about Trump I Need to\nGet back to the constitution and protect the civil liberties of every citizen whether it doesn't matter what political affiliation they are that ... that's what the left used to be good at but those days are long gone and it's time for you\nIt doesn't matter what political affiliation they are that ... that's what the left used to be good at but those days are long gone and it's time for you to hash tag walk away is the reality of it [noise] Leon what's uh what what else you got an your notes there\nAre well just to ah to follow up on the same thing that you're saying there you know Hillary Clinton has come out ah as you mentioned uh just earlier this week I Believe saying that the Democrats can't be civil\nWith Republicans because the Republicans are out to destroy the country to destroy democracy you can't be civil with those kind of ... this is coming from Hillary Clinton who\nHas a tendency to kind of rubber out her enemies she's got along with the people that she didn't like who are no longer living and breathing and so you are seeing really a large cross section of the leadership of the Democratic party now\nI mean Nancy Pelosi has said the same thing Chuck Schumer has said the same thing\nIs that this this attitude is we are the resistance every means available is good and write they think they're fighting evil they're fighting the destruction of the country it's okay to use violence it's okay to use intimidation and bullying and threats\nAnd one of the questions I think that a lot of us who are conservative or libertarian on the right side a Trump supporters\nHow exactly do we respond to this\nAh and I'd like to ask you this question because there's a party that wants to say come on bring it I dare you to take a swing at me because I'll deck yeah I Swear I Will kill you\nIf you're a left is the ... but I don't think that's probably the best response to this what does what should we do on the right besides going to vote next month\nHow do you respond to violence bullying intimidation from the radical left well never won\nA as Alex Jones always has talked about Rocco bomb in the ... days he always pray for him and I ... I Hope that we communicate that to them somehow just even though they are hateful even though there are so violent wicked just no for one we're praying for you\nAnd that we're still your countrymen so I think always take that high ground that we actually take the high ground a Hitler in ... and then when it comes to actually debating them because it will go there because nine out of ten will not care whether you pray for them or not\nThey do not pray they they what they think they're theologians of course so to they know everything about Christianity they think they're theologians but they're not\nA then\n... uh like Ben Shapiro says also when you get into a debate with the left just show 'em how immoral they are showed them their hypocrisy you know I think every concern of it conservative in in the back a drawer of your brain just think of ten\nUh hypocrisy is that the um that the left\nIs engaged and number one and Hillary set at this last week and I read about it how old the right wing is so in with the corporations bowl\nIt's the opposite that Democrats are in bed with the corporations look at the donor list of the Democratic politicians there in the bed\nWith the big mega banks and with the nasty corporations is not the right wing now yeah you do have the establishment right wing\nBut not this new Trump party that's moving up\nIf the nasty corporations is not the right wing now yeah you do have the establishment right wing but not this new Trump party that's moving up it is it is by patriots despite a it's it's by a lovers of freedom\nAnd then also what you have to do this is very important I don't know how I don't know how to describe how you're going to do this but there will come a time where you have got to say no\nI don't know how how what that means but that is how I've been taught when it comes to politically when it comes spiritually there comes a point where evil is going to come at you you have got to tell them no\nYou're not going to get my guns no I'm not going to let you tread on my freedoms no I don't you are not going to destroy this country you have got to ... say no\nAnd then evil will back off because evil will have they they will it will run scared and the good people even the ones on even ones on the left and you're seeing them walk away right now will rally behind that stern no\nThere's a conscience in most people that are still at work 'cause again I I Believe that there's still a lot of good people on the right wing led like Joe Joe Rogan not on either side\nBut when they see that boldness that you're not afraid to confront them\nAnd they see that you're fighting for every body you're ... you're fighting for the guy out there the antifa member when you say there should be freedom of speech because you're basically saying they they're allowed to say what they're saying\nThat is very noble and as very honorable and you have got to say no at some point it might be on line it might be at a political rally it might be of course are you folks\nI don't know I Can't give you the details but that's what you say as evil as evil comes at you know at your house when evil comes to your country to your state you have got to say no\nThat's good you know what you've mentioned there I think is is exactly right uh we don't want to slide into hatred and violence into the mud\nAnd dirt and disgrace that the left is now ... we don't want to join them in that ...\nAnd you know one of the most self destructive things you can do is hate and this is why the left is going to self destruct sooner or later is because they're based upon hatred hatred cannot win law it is all was ultimately self destructive\nAnd so yeah I think you're right you know if if you've uh want\nTo send a message to the president to congressmen the senators who who have shown strengths who have shown a backbone\nIt is said that blending human computer and machine will increase mental agility memory physical strength and give the ability to remotely controlled machines and it's like making yourself your own\nRemote control or being permanently connected to the Internet that\nThe U.S army plans to implant microchips and all of its soldiers I just say remotely controlled super soldiers\nAnd expert claims that worshipping AI or bring out the best in humans Google cofounder Anthony eleven ... established the way the future religion to develop and promote the God had based on artificial intelligence\nThat AI won't be your garden savior\nEven Dr Conn of Baylor University says that the way of the future a I got had could progress humanity and contribute\nTo a better society people to worship technology replaces heartfelt human experiences with a machine experiences [noise]\nCable here so people but a warning about Mark Cuban as well as ... ... have made comments to the dangers of AI they both agreed that whoever controls this technology will control the ultimate weapon\nAnd think Google is working on it this is a real pleasant\nTim at weapon and think Google is working on it\nThis is a real present present danger your lawn mosque made many warnings about artificial intelligence some of his comments are we need to be super careful with AI it is potentially more dangerous than nukes\nWith AI we're summoning demon other comment with AI we've all veal blow in intelligence we will be like a pet a house cat there will be at ten percent chance that making AI safe\nIt's going to affect our lives in ways we cannot imagine we could create an immortal dictator from where there is no scape\nAnother comment his last I keep sounding the alarm until people start seeing robots going down the street killing people they won't know how to react\nVery good piece there bill while I mean you open up so many different cans of worms that we need to go through their\nUh you know I've been talking now for four years on the rate of that the ... ultimate technology that they want to build they've talked about this for a long time I actually met Ray Kurzweil in two thousand twelve he did not just ... he he's been bragging about this for decades\nSaying that they're building everlasting life technology we are there's a few of us that will live forever or they're going to download our consciousness and then they're just going to upgrade their new body there robotic body every ten Fifteen fifty years or whatever it takes\nAnd they fully expect\nTo not have to face\nJudgment day that is the goal they never want to answer to God for their crimes they went to rival God in it some day they want to overthrow him [noise]\nAh ... what was bragging about that he was like by twenty thirty or that they're human machines artificial intelligence robotics will be more advanced than the human brain and with like you said\nThey will become our masters and we will simply by twenty fifty it'd be their pets yeah ... those of which are going to be left because\nUh he believes that the robotics are going to see or the artificial intelligence the robots are going to see human beings as a virus\nThat's his opinion I mean and this is a hateful evil squarely little man when I was I mean I was right up next to this is the head of future technology of ... Google yeah I was right next to him and he's still the president all you've lost even coal\nYeah just yeah\nEvil is a good word just you can feel there's something wrong with that guy he just hates human beings\nI get a comment to this of what I researched a lot of these tech heads what they do is they'll go to some of these big seminars and some of these things and they'll do a certain kind of drug and this drug opens them up completely to the demonic\nAnd then what they do is they see the advice of the demonic on what the manufacturing what directions to go with their companies are corporations\nAnd I think this is partially why we're seeing what we're saying and burning man is one of those events that a lot of these people show up to and I cannot think of the name of this drug but I Would equate it kind of like an LSD jealousy it directly opens them up into the demonic\nMany drugs do that right Chris I mean they they give you elusive ...\nIt directly opens them up into the demonic\nSo many drugs do that right Chris I mean they they give you hallucinations a demons we'll talk to you yeah if you take these ... which most people wouldn't recognize them as being evil spirits as we know within biblical Christianity but that's clearly what\nThere are encountering it's not a figment of their imagination they'll say it's an lightened meant\nAnd that's why so many people go to India and Thailand to boot their Buddhist who can send to ... that there too you take these drugs these mind bending drugs they call it and they oh I've been in lightened with new information technology but actually they are just really communing\nWith an evil spirits yes to compare it kind of like to the Christian algae we take communion to be with we remember the lord yes we're in a fight with his death and resurrection until he returned yes and remember him one one great pass or even\nGot into that uh he talked about I listen to this about a year ago he's like noticed the word remember\nA ... member remember me the churches to be the members of his body you are now ... by taking communion you remember me I'm being remembered I'm I'm coming together again\nA and you can kinda see that when a saint does that with his people too\nAnd that I think artificial intelligence putting the computer chip you are than men bring up\nThe demonic force of loose suffer to rival God because they don't want to face that judgment day All right I'm going to throw another huge ... thing I\nI I we are going to have to continue this discussion because this is this ... this is so big gets deep it gets really deep many areas and it's very important because you're giving the big picture of their plan we're totally exposing them right now I'm either going to go one step further right now for this discussion\nIs what I see happening is is climate change stuff isn't going to work it's not going or at least it's not going to go fast enough to where they can power grab and implement the new world order\nSo the demons are going to step it up and I were going to have to bring another ... a gas to who I was talking to about this\nThat really articulated their plan really well is there going to bring in\nAll of a sudden we're going to see lights in the sky school yeah they're going to bring aliens and when these aliens come down they're going to bring a message\nSaying something like this we have seen that you have progressed to a point because we see your artificial tech artificial intelligence technology bringing you human beings together as one that's how they're going to say\nAnd and that those leaders of the new world order the anti Christ if if that if we are living in ... the luminaries anti Christ will be coming into power and their two they're going to say we will talk to you only through him\nHe will be the ... so if you want to talk to us aliens the true gods and they will say they are our creator and you any other voices are false prophet yes yes and Korea and those yes those religions needs the end of yours that's yeah hindering you sell\nThe house and part of this will be implemented to project ... this is where they can project\nThree D. holographic image is in the sky and make them so realistic that they you look at it and it's like God is talking to you and it will be mass deception on a grand scale\nAnd they will bring back by holograms certain end\nGetting to you and it will be mass deception on a grand scale and\nThey will bring back by holograms certain individuals who have died such as John F. Kennedy or or or Lincoln are great leaders of the past\nJohn Lennon John Lennon yes yes they will mention there's ... imagine there's going to have and he was a great profits of his time trying to teach\nPeople the wisdom and truth of us you call us alien but they'll give themselves a certain name or whatever and they were they will like you say they will holographic them out and you will not be able to tell\nIf that's really real or not and and it is going to be a mass is actually I think that is really the mass deception along with the mark of the beast everything you talking about their\nThe everlasting technology that's all part of the St plant you just connect the dots connect the dots they are trying to build a resistance to God is what you have tragic it's the tower babble yeah basically she was going to live forever brand that her sets and brings death\nRight that's I think Blake water part of the reason why they're growing human organs on pigs and other animals is for this concept that hey if one wears out we have plenty of spare parts eventually we can live and go on and on and on forever", "city": "Tucson"}
