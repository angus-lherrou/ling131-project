four one K. kids [noise]\nOver the world wrestling also great to have somebody on wages frozen is [noise] it's always nice to have\nAnd figure out what's happening from\nThe White House but I like about that when I talk to Russia I Want to talk to kill you and when he talked to others ... who are in the administration they're sitting in the White House when I talk to them so I ...\nIt to me it's still very heady ... dental assume anything is still very heady bad that we have\nAccess to the White House ... on on this little dog and pony show we ever you know it's pretty awesome yeah\nIt is because um you could either wait for the media to tell you what the White House is saying or you can read the president's tweets or talk to Kelly in somebody else there so it's always great and um it sounds like\nShe's in alignment with you which is that there's gonna be a vote this week mhm on a on Brett Kavanaugh on my car I think there should have been about last week and Brett Kavanaugh because um these allegations had no teeth at all\nBut ... the weird part for me is and those are people singing in Arizona I mean maybe you can help me out with this guy but Jeff Flake pretends that he's ready to vote for Kavanaugh in the full Senate provided to do with FBI investigation for a week\nAnd Gary correct me if I'm wrong I keep hearing that flake is talking about how he can't put somebody on the court now who's got that temperament\nI have seen some of those report yeah but that everybody that that's why they took that vote last week\nRight that was basically he gave us we're just going to do the investigation you've got my vote and now suddenly it's about temperament so exactly what I said would have happened happened last week with the with the vote off and they said let's wait for the investigation\nUm but actually you know is there are going to be more allegations there were although they were fake one guy just had a like on two hundred so yeah I made it up and he's like he's now facing an FBI investigation\nAnd then I said that there would be more that would come out about him and now the temperament fingers what they thought they could latch onto because of how you reacted when he gave his opening statement last week so suddenly he's in bar fights and stuff mhm so that's exactly what they're trying to prove a and then there was this very\nWhen he gave his opening statement last week so suddenly he's in bar fights and stuff so that's exactly what they're trying to prove a and then there was this very specious allegation about why he lied under oath he committed perjury and then that was completely blown out of the water because I guess NBC News reporting on this did not report everything that was said\nBecause he does in fact say that\nWhat happened happened or that he knew about something that was happening um and it was reported as if he said he didn't know\nWhich wasn't true so the whole thing stinks just do the bill already Jeff Flake is out soon and if he is going to be a lobbyist as Michael Malice were saying the other day if he is going to be a lobbyist he's not going to get a whole lot of help from people on the right I'm In that he's trying to stop this\nUm this nomination from happening it's very strange to me I think you will at least see McCaskill and probably um\nWho's the guy in ... in West Virginia mansion you probably will see them um go for Kavanaugh as well so it probably will be fifty two who do you want to fifty two maybe even fifty three depending on what\nCollins and Murkowski in these in these others do there really isn't anything else they can drop now that would be relevant to stop this vote from happening\nBut I Do wish that somebody would ask the question and I think it's a good journalistic question\nHey senator Booker grow because hey senator Coons say senator Harris hey senator Columbus or will you vote yes to confirmed this guy if the investigation shows nothing new but nobody asked that question I think that that's a valid question we go to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to ah\nGoing to be aligned to actually barber wants to talk about Minnesota politics the barrio hold on until after we have dug ward low he'll be at the bottom of the hour this way we can talk to in context to that uh that it it's a race for attorney general in that state that the entire nation is that the world is watching between Keith Ellison\nAnd Douglas we'll have more information as we do that let me go to a is it a go ahead\nI was getting into that you mentioned senator Cory Booker didn't hear what he said\nYeah and I don't know but but somebody said he was on who's really do well\n... ... and this is from Fox News and the ongoing FBI probing the allegations against Frank how he suggested to fit it needs to quote move on to another Supreme Court nominee whether Kavanaugh as innocent or guilty\n[noise] see I mean when you're when you live your life through such a scope of asked wagon read as as grow because does when you live your life through the lack of rationale maybe we should move on from him being a senator because he admitted the groping somebody we're sifting maybe we should do that ... ... is that\nCarry I don't care what side of the aisle you're on can his sentence that he just made me just reported cannot make sense to anybody\nWell now and it goes back to what you were talking about because now he's saying his credibility cabinets credibility is being challenged on his temperament has been revealed a at last week's hearings and whether he's guilty or innocent he really shouldn't be on the Supreme Court\nMakes no sense All right the neighbor's dog on line six dog what's going on\n\nIs your name dog it says the O. J. is a Doug what's your name I Know you can hear me because I'm looking at Minnesota been on hold for about an hour last chance\nAnd get out of here I let you go back to it and say hello and welcome to a shame and Fort Worth ... what's going on\n[noise] hey how you doing Joe living the dream Shea what's happening\nAm a first time caller so they never really called into show before but I have a son I wanted to throw at you that at all [laughter] I Am one of these people out here is a as totally support Kavanaugh and I'm frustrated that based upon what you were just saying about sunset or saying let's get it\nThere is a as settlers for Kavanaugh and I'm frustrated but based upon what you were just saying about so they are saying let's get it yeah really haven't been in somebody else yeah\nThat's kind of a similar thing that I was going to throw at you just monitor and about and it wouldn't be completely\nAt all fair to Kavanaugh but I don't understand the timing of all this I think that he should go through but when you're talking about these three centers that might vote against and we're talking about a Democrat over here or something something in the Math Doesn't add up\nI I don't know how much time I have till the next election\nSo my mind I was sitting there wondering not that you can trust any do you make with a Democrat but if the deal was that you lack Kavanaugh go by the wayside\nAnd Trump take Aimee Bartlett for example is that her name\nAmy Barrett beret come up\nI don't know if you can totally skipped the judicial process of the Senate committee and all that kind of stuff to just say okay we're going to get rid of it yeah and then he gets to name her and she goes through and we don't even have all this dog and pony show going on about it\n... ... ... and the Democrats are only about our about politics and and that's all this is demonstrate for the entire country how very political negatively political a Democratic Party buses are\nKeith almost ... thought that he would be the chairman of the DNC he was actually is that when Tom for as one and and now he's the the vice chair as you said this is one he's one of the faces of a party\nUm and he's faces these allegations and you said this very well known repeated these are recent allegations I mean as recently as August\n... the route of hands sun is\nOut there you know publishing the allegations me this isn't something that's thirty six years ago that you can't remember what House you were in or would they of the week it was or who was there um is is Monaghan\nFully cooperating because you have to assume that politically she might be similar to him since she was linked with him for for a while she cooperating and and will there be a prosecution in your opinion\nWell there's certainly a criminal investigation that there should be the fact that are in the Democratic government is that they're trying to round the clock they're trying to early voting has already started in Minnesota\nAnd trying to round the clock than trying to call for investigation and of course things past November six or ... I actually have a a you know and that the electrical occurred yeah as a strategist round the clock and and we've got to stop them from doing that or else and\nOne of the base of the Democratic party nationally he wants to be the attorney general Minnesota and he has said this on TV he has said that he wants to drink so he can basically obstruct President Trump's agenda he wants to bring lawsuits against the president\nOn things from immigration to the Internet wants to lead the charge and other Democrats state attorneys general ... Oregon the president and that's just inappropriate\nIt's Doug wardlaw he's the Republican running for attorney general great state of Minnesota I think he should win the polls are very close right now but it's important to reiterate what you just said he's running or just as an anti Trump guy\nThe attorney general's job is I'm guessing you know 'cause you want the job is not to make law\nIs not going to bring frivolous suits is not to to argue because of your political or religious or whatever persuasion it is to follow\nThe law enforce the law do the job I mean Eric Holder probably was a very good mentor for Keith Ellison as to what he would do as a G because as the attorney general for the United states of America Eric Holder only took his walking papers and talking papers from Obama and obstructed justice of if nothing else\nIf you get the job what do you see the job as and keep in mind Minnesota was almost read almost when Trump in the last election so it's a very very tight race for good reason what are you bring to the people who are listening watching right now that that Keith Ellison couldn't\nAbsolutely is Iran that they ... out of the office to stand up to the rule of law they trade is a law enforcement\nPosition in the legislature makes the laws and the executive branch attorney general enforces the law of execution laws and not rank or policy not right away the political war with the author of the office and focus on getting Minnesota ... say ... lungs are very simple message and is representing the folks all across this on\nA ... a G dot com Doug ward low W.

G. dot com that Doug as far as I'm watching with Keith bellows soon as saying he is like gladly saying I I Would love to bring more refugees here I Would love to keep on bringing people in that we don't really have a chance to vet\nUm that we should probably fight the president's attempt to stop bringing people in from places that we can't vet and Minnesota should just be where they where they put these people\nThat's a really odd tactic why does he think that's going to work and then why is he tied with you in the polls which is strange to me well we're working on\nThe odd tactic why does he think that's going to work and and why is he tied with you in the polls which is strange to me\nWell we're we're going to name recognition and and building that up and so people were were still getting the message out to folks and it's going very well and just need to raise\nA little bit more money and get the message out there and I think that as the ... across the state talking to folks get the message out there that they're coming on board in droves and we have the momentum that's very good ... else's answer all the more you know he works better than the main eight grade uh here in Minnesota\n... what did he where I actually going to hear what you said he wore\nA T shirt in the may ... here in Minnesota that ran in Spanish I don't believe in Bor and recently interviewed and and he said that he thinks general orders create an injustice so how can a person doesn't leading the concept for borders need the state's top law enforcement official\n... if he doesn't believe in borders do a good way to go on a whim year he doesn't believe in the sovereignty of our nation I mean if that thinks that borders should not exist he's literally saying Canada and Mexico are part of his country\nAnd they're not I mean there's a reason why people keep on trying to come here because it's better on this side of the border that's why the border as necessary so we know exactly who's coming what they are bringing with them whether they're legal to come here and so on I ... I could never understand the guy like a Keith Ellison saying\nEverybody should be able to flood the state because that will change anything of course it'll change something they'll bring with them whenever it is that that was bothering them or didn't work for them in their in their previous country um the ... that's an important piece of information\nIt's forty one eye it's forty one to forty one right now\nFourteen percentage point you're telling me are undecided\nUndecided soliciting and they're watching right now ... Keith bellows in history as an alleged abuser is important history has an open borders guy is important\nBut in every ... in everyday life for Minnesotans they don't think well I Wonder the age he's doing for me today so why should they lean your way and not his way because again once you are he takes the office they don't think about that job much\nRight they should come my way because he Ellison if he were elected as Minnesota let's say as a less there he's ... he's going to lose weight taxpayer resources and wages for a war against President Trump which is completely inappropriate is going to be too distracted doing all that\nThe focus on the train you shouldn't do namely ... county attorney and prosecutors they writer that given the opioid epidemic on dealing with human trafficking and the problem with that in Minnesota there's so many things that need to focus on it and bring law enforcement our deal when that will just be glad that my ... too busy waiting his political wars\nAnd it'd be waging a national political war which doesn't bode well for an individual state where he should be enforcing the law Doug I appreciate you dug ward low A.

live and um the people there seem to be responding thank you tell your friends why not\nAnd uh and we always see excellent numbers across the land and as they come in I'd be happy to tell different cities thank you so much um but yeah I mean that's a big deal it was a big move for for ... say with John live and see what happens\nIs that how are you in the south Florida you know there's another show that's on at the same time yeah ... ... ... oh stand ... let me just say that I met with that right after that he didn't need any nine for one pack edited what's that\nSaid that he doesn't do parodies\nOh it's not usually the costs of carry so you know I wanted you to not I think you know ... that's what I thought it was oh I I've only about ... million that let me go to Waco ... things are going to be Russian Waco or what's going on ...\nA year and there are so did you suddenly John really did you\nKnow not really it was a house or I'm I'm Glad your last call who absolutely dead on money your thirties or absolutely\nI cannot agree they Bob I could not agree with you more so what's on your mind\nAt saying look\nThis this whole thing the Kavanaugh's reputation getting on\nA lot of people don't realize exactly what that means I Know I've been there okay at an edge to accuse me of molesting her\nThree year old daughter uh even though we had evidence to prove it they still drug money into court and we're only over the coals and every time they were asked for their evidence oh well we don't have the right now or is that your office or or still gathering information and it's like really\nWhen you go to court if you're being charged with something to people this argument you had better damn well bring the evidence with them yeah it cost me a relationship with my daughter\nI haven't seen like ... ... a until she was a Fifteen year old and that was when she started asking questions or mom finally gave up said here they called me all fall I'm On the road driving the truck they say or sending your daughter to you I think [laughter] I only have a home my house is in my truck\nSo until they change the leadership thought nothing it's going to be business as usual and Broward\n... well the problem is and we talked to briefly about the nine year old before we started here today Andy he now is probably going to be put on the promise program vis the fact that he brought a gun to school will probably not be known by when he goes to middle school or when he goes to high school the teachers there won't know the administrators won't know the security won't know and here's a guy that\nYou should probably look out for now he's somebody who brought a gun to school right\nYeah it's kind of terrible you know and and then we just had this big or food festival here this weekend that they politicized the whole shooting in Parkland or Alyssa Milan it was here\nAnd it wasn't supposed to be a political event but they turned it into a an anti gun rally like they always do and to me that that's really a deflection of what happened\nHere in Parkland because there's numerous entities that are at fault or that led up to February fourteenth I'd be the first one to blame if it was the gun I I'd go along with it but I I Know because I looked into it\nAnd I have an investigation going on Joe and there's a lot of people responsible for what happened said boy fourteen and one of them are it's not the n._r._a.\nAlyssa mulatto was of the cabinet Harry's too I just don't we should get funding of acting work I think that's the issue it's a ... he's the father of metal metal would have been Nineteen this coming friday um\nLet me just ask you about some of the other survivors and I know that you're not a guy battle beat up on on him over David or Kyle and I ask you a beat up on them but\nHow would that not coyote camera in a cast you recently shorter said you know I didn't really know what this march for a large was really bad and I'm kind of rethinking how I acted on stage and what I said and how and presented I went back and looked at some of the ...\nReally know what this march for a large was really bad and I'm kind of rethinking how I acted on stage and what I said and how in presented I went back and looked at some of the video and I don't know that I'm as helpful and I'm paraphrasing when I look at them as helpful as I could have been and then you've got the you know the AMA who's just tweeting about cabinet which makes no sense that's not now fixing anything\nAnd then I think David is is a confused so because one day he's boycotting people sponsors and the next day he's getting into college and doing just that the other any thought to be ... you've always said from the beginning Joe their kids this is what kids do I agree with you but the left in this country the anti gun\nLeft in this country want it to say they're the experts we have to listen to them any thoughts on how the progress since February\nSure there's a there's a couple of things I Want to ah talk to about it's easy for people to just blame the gun you know what I mean that that's the easy route I could just anyone could just say it's the gun and ... and not really looking to really what happened and that's easy but getting back to the kids that I'd really like to tell you have a\nCamera in ... and ...\nThey came and they help in the campaign they actually came out in Broward to try and make a difference so that they did come and help those to the ... the others I I don't know where they are you know\nI don't really but I Know Cameron Kane he reached out to me we met a couple of times camera that myself and he came out and helped us campaign he came to early voting so he really wanted to make a difference in Broward\n... well I'm with you and I think that he's sort of had a realization that he does have the power and the social media strength that we used to make a difference and he stands back and says I don't know that have made the difference that I wanted to the others I think are are in their own world but but Cameron's seems to have come around to just happen to have a conversation with him about about what he seems to be seeing now\nWell he wants to take a look at both sides right oh ... oh so he's open minded to a meeting with\nWith with any side whoever wants to talk to him he'd open minded and and that's what the world needs more people that are sit down with someone who ... who has a different opinion themselves and work it out not someone that's just so one sided right and that's what I think uh he came he gotten right\nIt is a Republican who lost his daughter metal at Parkland in Parkland, Florida there must be a high school or any our schools safer today than they weren't February\nAll they were safe they're safer because they had more armed guards but could anyone get into the school at anytime they want yes you know anyone's going to be able to walk in with a knife a hatch it a pipe bomb until we rarely secure the schools and I think it's gonna take metal detectors I don't know how many years it's going to take but\nThat's the only way that we're going to guarantee our kids and our teachers safe inside of schools for one I don't think we're there yet\nWhy won't be hard and the schools what's the problem with with making it one way you one way out at least in the morning in the afternoon and 'cause I don't know what if you get into a stairwell nobody can get into a back door nobody can be no one could hide a gun to the bathroom and come back later and do something why will they just hartnett somewhere somebody who is in a forty can see who's coming in and what they have\nIt well they are working on single point entries okay a lot of schools doing that in Broward and throughout the country but it's still comes to it like you know so it's a single point entry if there's a student there he could bring anything in that he wants to ...\nSo until you know but it's just that society we don't we wouldn't want it like that we didn't grow up like that\nWe didn't know what I look I don't want to be I don't want to be a prison that's for sure but at the same time I want to be able to either have enough armed guards and only one preschool isn't going to help you how to resource officer there who who sat on who's going to be nothing um I I won't even more of them to to defend our children\nIsn't going to help you had a resource officer there who who sat on his gun and did nothing um I I Want either more of them to to defend our children or I Want there to be fewer entrances or some sort of a a la carte or something that you need that that says you're allowed to be there this guy wasn't allowed to be there\nAnd he got it and he got in with a rifle bag it doesn't make any sense so if if that sort of scenario can still happen and I wonder if you think you can what do we changed\nWhile it just happened the other day you know the get right down the street and Lauren Hill a nine year old walked into the school\nSo I don't you know they're definitely making progress with more on guard single point of entries um they're putting the parameters around schools but until we get to the point where we make it like a federal building our court house any kid you know if he wants to do their job they're going to get into the school and do what\nDo I want somebody there to defend against people it is it is an air ... and it is that it's getting there largely because of your efforts in you know how much I appreciate a our friendship and be what you've done to make schools safer when my kids go to school\nIt's I'm Andrew Pollack F.

but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from room to room where\nAsked me to join them in prayer to you know to pray for healing and in progress of this country and I have no doubt that's been part of this how you doing\nGreat thanks for having me on they of Savage Tim relentlessly and shamelessly and morally and what's going on as a microcosm of the the excess digital struggle we're in with the left today\nAnd it's why I Am so happy that we have a a general in charge and Donald Trump because he fights back in all these purists\nHe's never Trump purists who who think that he doesn't have the right manners they sit on the sidelines expect us to be passive and meanwhile the country's being taken from us by these relentless people on the left\nAnd and just the Democrats are just so shameless and they're almost a parody of themselves they said they wanted the FBI investigation that was never about Kavanaugh's character is about his judicial philosophy they don't want any originalist on there they want somebody who will preserve\nTheir judicial manufactured right to an abortion so\nThat they become a parity that they demand more time they never were going to accepting like pre announce that they would reject him and it's despicable I'm sick of our our side or some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll put the nail\nOur side or some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll put the nail the coughing on this thing and get Kavanaugh confirmed because as you said he's one of the\nMost qualified and and and one one of those things is worried people find judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big gift for the Republicans going forward David because that they're Democrats or the party of resistance and intimidation rabble\nRousing and chaos and meanwhile Trump\nIs slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is if Congress this fall\nBut we did read it NAFTA he's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through again it's not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now he has more than a seventh of all federal judges are Trump\nAppointees uh and obviously if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and I think he will be confirmed that means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long past Trump's administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nYeah and and some people say well the reason you guys want Trump is just because we're gorgeous well no it's not just because of him it's because all the other judicial appointments his foreign policy is the economy it's taxes\nAnd its regulations it's better trade deals that say it's standing up to the left and finally we have a warrior in there who will fight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity and realize that we're in a in a in a serious battle\nTo preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is and where mccaskey and all the others are columns but I'm hoping with this FBI favorable report and we're hearing it's favorable that they won't have the the audacity to vote against him at this point\nUh David you have immerse yourself in religious history and the history of the Christian Church in your new book a Jesus has risen Paul in the early church continues um\nUh you're you're writing and you're you're you're you're really ... ... ...\n... in in many ways newly are emerging as a thinker on the religious underpinnings of our society but it's really important for people to understand\nHow the early church was formed\nHow unlikely it was that these followers early followers of Christ or we're going to you know basically drop everything and devote their entire lives and and give their lives or to this ah this new phenomenon and Jesus Christ or tell us about why\nThis book was you know it was so important for you to write at this point in your own life\nAh well I'm I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible cause I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands on I started\nInhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I add something\nSome some books some guys and tremors that would help me understand it better and be less intimidated so as I've\nStudied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back and start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so the last book I wrote was about the gospels and ... put it paraphrasing and stayed at most of the versus the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book\nJesus has risen is about the book of acts the history of the early ...\nGospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book Jesus as resin is about the book of acts the history of the early church\nOr which follows the gospels and then six of false Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed the planet and they were they were dissipating from the the true gospel they were following falls teachers and he would write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters\nUrging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of\nOf adversity in opposition and secular influences core and it was a hotbed of sexual immorality and I'd olive tree with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't mix and sinker ties their religion with our religion Jesus Christ is the son of God to follow him and come back\nAnd we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church there's there's the conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel\nWhich has faith in Jesus Christ alone to salvation and we see people mixing that up and mixing that message to the detriment of all potential converts and so\nWe want to hew to the truth and and encourage people to understand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my books is to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a\nA an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law\nAnd win anyway it was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were new competing religion\nBut that they were perverting the religion of God and and it was Judy as was a religion of God's ... and ... there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be the messiah because they expected the Jews expected a military our political\nI deliver from the the forces that the authorities at the time\nAnd they didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was\nA hung on a tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver them victory he didn't even raise their hand in his own defense and he was killed on the cross\nAnd so he can't be the messiah and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians that in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the St ... to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus road blind them with light and converted him\nTo from the ... the greatest persecute or to the greatest evangelists So Paul\nThen long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around in it in the periphery of the Roman empire and established churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelists because he was the greatest persecuted but God picked him in the Bible says before he created the universe\nAnd I think he did it because he had those qualities he veers intellectual and relentless\nAnd determined and ultimately a follower of got\nThat part I think this is Mike around two fifty seven in your book um where you talk about how\nThe apostle Paul corrected\nObviously in the letters that current in church\nWhere you talk about how the apostle Paul\nCorrected obviously in the letters the Corinthian church um and it the way he did it was not with condemning Atari language or\n[noise] you know railing at the end pointing us things that you're going to turn all damnation but it was with with love and respect and you talk about how that is a great lesson and I think I Need to take that less than\nWe all do um because it's easy to get you know upset or demoralized or even angry at people when they don't see what you say but that's not really the way to change minds\nNo and he can't argue people into the kingdom who we got to be a little different than we are in politics but\nYou know you you don't want to be too strident and he what he said he he will be all things to all people not meaning he would be a hypocrite and compromises values he would never dilute the gospel message but he would not sweat the small stuff so when he was around Jews who would\nAdopt their practices ... as long as they didn't violate his basic core principles there's around Greeks he would do what they did he would talk he would invoke Greek poetry to get into their minds and to relate to them and then he was present the truth of the universe and the gospel\nOf salvation through Jesus Christ\nAnd it was kind of reminds me of one of my favorite apologist today Ravi Zacharias he says when we approach people in a van july's and tell them about to say\nWrong plan for Arizona today Arizona is a national leader in solar energy we ranks third in the country and solar deployment we're doing at

thing I'm pretty sure they don't care how shall I don't understand live I Do have to I don't care yeah he was like I don't care about your little story that you're talking on the radio I'm Fred you'll do it I Can't drive to divide\nIt'd be a judge Jerry give us the update out to be a set of Judiciary Committee and from the full of the ... was submitted ...\nFrom CBS the general consensus so far from Republicans who viewed the FBI report about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's background is that yields and no new information or additional cooperating information Democrats however blasting the report as severely incomplete\nSenators on Thursday or taking turns reviewing the report falling demands for a more thorough investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against President Trump's nominee the White House receive the report overnight and transmitted it to the Senate Judiciary committee before each member of the Senate had the chance to review a single copy in person on Capitol Hill\nOr Republicans don't plan to begin voting on cabin on the Senate floor friday with final vote on Saturday the Senate Judiciary committee Chuck Grassley claimed to report revealed nothing the committee did not already know inter veiled no contemporaneous evidence to support the allegations Senator Dianne Feinstein the Democratic ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee said quote\nThe most notable part of this report is what's not in it\nAnd one senator was the only have one copy of the reports reviewing a secure room in the basement of the U.S Capitol\nThe White House as senators have ample time to review the seventh background inquiry into Kavanaugh's record as senators on both sides are expected to have you with a report in one hour increments than an effort to limit the possibility of potential leaks Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion Wednesday for cloture vote on Kavanaugh for friday\nThose close to the situation now anticipated confirmation vote to come sometime Saturday and precise scheduling will come from McConnell\nWell there you go to the bottom\nLine is I don't see how the Democrats yourself is even if they wanted to and trust me they want to I don't see how it's going to happen now let me ask the general question are those who are listening and watching it eight nine ... nine four one Seventy four seven\n\nAre you ready for this to be over now and maybe even better maybe even better um\nHas this energized you whether you're left or right Democrat or Republican conservative or independent or liberal has this energized\nThis energized you whether you're left or right Democrat or Republican conservative or independent or liberal has this energized you the polling seems to say that the left is a little embarrassed by what's going on here and maybe not as energized and the right is like awakened\nSo I wandered eighty nine for one pack Joe ... dot com has this entire debacle\nAnd to\nThe bottom line that the left just never really gave this guy a chance and we're only resisting because it was a Trump appointee has this ball over their faces heavy overplay their hand have ... at the end of the day prove themselves to be insular children\nAnd you know you see McCaskill's probably going to lose\nYou see that ... who who is it in I'm In North Dakota can think of her name she down by twelve boys now she's gonna lose she's out the Senate probably will pick up a few of us for Republicans\nInstead of seeing fewer Republicans and more Democrats as these were were promising and expecting they're going to see fewer Democrats or Republicans\nBecause people are awakening to the fact that they don't play fair they're trying to be fair then I'm trying to find the right person for the court they're trying to find somebody that well they're trying to stop you realize that they they would be happy to have eight\nThey were saying that when they first were coming in Arkansas now than when you know normal suburbia got a hold of that like oh no that's not the way our constitutional oh that was just a joke you know it wasn't\nIt scary burn get his book is called

other presidents door just them\nI was I started with a pop all bliss okay we're worker Bush eight years of the Clintons and then two years with\nUm thrown out of the Bush yeah George W cool\nUm so I mean you definitely saw a difference in temperament between the bushes and the Clintons but when you see what's unfolding in Washington now the just the sheer attacks on Kavanaugh what made me think about you was\nI was ... I was thinking back to the stories that you have in your books you know we've talked about it seems as though back then Twenty years ago or so they would do the same thing they're doing the cabinet but they do it behind closed doors and make smile for the cameras now that I still get in front of the cameras aren't they\nWrite what they're doing yeah exactly what they're doing Joe is ... ... to ... the same thing they did to accuses of Bill Clinton or to anybody that got under way um you know look what they're trying to do to a former Speaker Newt Gingrich\nRainy and spending a little bit you know the words that stole Christmas they want us to our children lesson don't misunderstand me I don't know branch having all really well but I had been in his\nPresence choice yeah I work for George W. Bush or twice I visited his presidents um I went when George W was president of the training center but I\nI came back to the White House some time to time and one weekend I was in the west wing visiting with one of the other officers a buddy of mine and and Brett Kavanaugh came in and he said hello to my ... my my\nCoworker they seem like a very nice guy and I said who is that it goes from illegal counsel's office and they actually say there's rumors about him like this guy is going places everybody lives in ... and the right loves him he is you know a true constitutional die\nAnd I said oh okay you know like I didn't mean much to me that in there\nAnd then not too much longer probably a year or so later a W comes out to the training Center for our dog and pony show at the secret service training center and I was lucky enough to be selected to do is on arrange a safety with the hand gone\nSo anyway ... was on this trip so when all this started happening\nI um I called my friend that that used to work in the west way and this guy worked in the west wing lobby for years and he retired last year and I said hey tell me about ... and he said Gary I'm telling you I don't recognize the thing is the nicest guy everybody loves him I he goes\nIf I egos if I gave you a list of all the Democrats as I saw in the White House and the west wing sucking up to this guy because they knew he was going places while he got it it would have all your this guy\nIs incredible he really is the good guy that they pick\nAnd now and now you've got these these are people elect this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill and Hillary especially Hillary Clinton is go\nKathleen willing was a volunteer for the Clintons she and her husband believes him a hundred percent you know they were Democrats they were believers they she volunteered over the oath of office building they ran into my natural problems she needed a paying job\nSo she had enough clout as a volunteer to pick up the phone call Nancy ...
