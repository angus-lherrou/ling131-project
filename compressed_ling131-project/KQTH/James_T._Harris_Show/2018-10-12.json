Michael ... wanted for one of the year you're midterm elections the nation's late I could\nOut really honored to have this special guest do right now it is a it's a team of Irma she is the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid with the Trump Administration Horatio ...\nAnd great and thanks for having me on the show today\nIt's an absolute pleasure thanks for taking the time you know it's interesting in this day and age we've got people on the left that'll say just about anything even if it's devoid effects so having you on to clarify some things is really special for my own or use it for me so thanks for\nTaking the time it's a pleasure so big announcement today um first of all the left is saying the Democrats the opposition they're all saying that this president\nAnd write them on to the administration you included are doing everything you possibly can to squash and get rid of Obamacare when the reality appears to be\nYou're making was in place now better now I Wish there were called something different but you're making it better and you're expanding it so that people could actually afford it more can you tell my listeners what what it is that you did today which they are\nAnd you know at the very beginning at the time the president was elected he made it very clear that he wants Americans to have more affordable options you\nDon't want them to have more choices and their health care\nAnd so we haven't focused on doing everything we can on the administrative level that doesn't involve Congress to try to to to deliver on that promise and I think what we've show today is that the president has been successful\nAnd for the very first time since Obama Care started we've actually seen that premiums are going down now it's only a drop of that at one point five percent and we're still not satisfied because we know that there's millions of Americans that still find coverage\nUnaffordable on exchanges\nBut I think that they show and it shows are critics that we are working to provide more affordable coverage to kill Americans\nIt is a seam of Irma and she is the administrator for um for the Obamacare marketplace well actually not for for Medicare and Medicaid services saying is now you've got that right\nSo if I'm hearing you right and if I read right what's happening today um in fact what we're getting is a ... you're seeing an expansion of competition more choices therefore that's pushing the the prices down is that what's going on\nAt the exactly at one of the things that we saw when we came into this administration that many Americans only had one choice a carrier in fact last year fifty percent of counties only had one carrier\nUm we made real progress towards that and now that number is decreased though we still have some areas of the country\nThat don't have choices of that number has gone down and we're probably around thirty nine percent made real progress we've got new carrier carriers that are coming in some carriers that left and that are now actually coming back carriers are moving into more areas so as you know when there's more choice ... got to get better quality are going to get better prices\nWere out and it and that's great more competition does equal lower prices I mean that's just that's basic business if you've got one one pizza joined the controlled really one for repeats of you've got two or three is going to drive the price down and give you more choices\nUm we're also hearing this and again it's um it's human Burma she's the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid and some very positive news about the strangers about the availability of of lower price healthcare although it's still way overpriced and that's going to be that's going to be examined closer but you're also hearing from the left that this president is looking to get rid of any availability\nFor coverage for those who have pre existing conditions and I just want to I Want to make a quick note to those watching television I think you can hear see and I'm going to see if I can actually speaking make that happen to know all the radio stations are hearing it so I I just wanna make sure that people understand I Am actually talking to somebody um see ... ... is is that the case that you see they're claiming on the left especially\nPresident is looking to get rid of it he covered for pre existing conditions and a better question is is he really doing\nAll the president's been very very clear from the beginning that he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions like he's been clear about that the secretary of health Alex days are Sinclair and I'm clear about that as well we will do everything that we can to make sure that people with preexisting conditions have the protections that they need and deserve\nOkay again for those who care if you're on the president's doing all the time and ... and the people working on those are they're doing all they can be key preexisting conditions covered the president said it again very directly yesterday I'm not trying to get rid of pre existing conditions those who are saying that I Am\nOr making that up and they just are pointing to something about a a ... well I guess they're not putting anything it's just it's just Felicia's as it is is this rooted in foods at all has the president ever said hey we should probably looking at I'm going to pre existing just not yet\nI think he's always been consistent that he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions I think the reality is our critics have been making all kinds of production they've been saying that the actions that the president's been taking is going to make things worse that it's going to increase\nThe cost of health insurance and we're seeing from today's results of that is simply not true that we're actually seeing decreases one of the great things that the president did was he got rid of the individual mandate you and you know that was a penalty\nFor people that couldn't afford health insurance in fact most of the people that were getting penalize or paying penalties eighty percent of those people were earning less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nAnd the president got rid of that and so you know that shows he's very concerned about people that you know have they're facing challenges with all this on affordable coverage funding that demonstrates his commitment to providing choice in lower cost individual\nUnless absolutely but ignored that that find that penalty that tax and John Roberts or none of them so the fundamental due to touch so it's allowed a vat tax\nWas was an orderly affecting people who were in the middle class and those people basically got their tax break through the tax cuts that their their bonuses from their jobs got their increases in pay and they stopped being tax unduly for something they didn't want to purchase an image never talked about in the legacy media is\nThat's right I mean in fact what we are hearing is that there were these dire predictions at the president got rid of the individual mandate if the president changed the regulations\nOn you know the president allowed short term limited duration plans to get more affordable coverage to people that if we did those things premiums would increase and I think the evidence shows today that that has not happened and in fact the\nReverse it happened ... lower premiums you know in the state of Tennessee premiums are going to go down twenty six percent that\nWe haven't seen that since Obamacare started\nYeah that's amazing it is against the move or we're going to follow her it's as easy as a lesson to be or I may to use the uh the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid services um one last thing that I've only got a a quick second here there's no way we could ever afford Medicare for all could read it three trillion dollar boondoggle the socialist you're talking about\nNow Medicare for all basically Medicare for non this would hurt seniors and it would sort of redirect the focus on the program elsewhere thirty two trillion dollars we can't afford it and it would hurt seniors\nOr is he was doing some believe recall it into the great information and great job and that was supposed to get into All right thank you\nAppreciate a team of Burma she's the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid services\nSo few weeks ago at\nThe top and I'm happy anniversary attack that often uh basically coverage on on their on their uh excuse me a little university website uh she's always there it was actually a law professor and a coke gotcha fellow um they have\nA union they co authored a an op ed titled a half an hour could undermine a diversity on college campuses and basically they were really arguing\nI'm by having a hot a\nWhere should not be a concern you ah if you will not going to support affirmative action in University in Michigan and\nThis is all a written theoretically and they\nPublished that you were in that you know that'd be posting during this time I'm ... I'm going to action lawsuit I Harvard University right and\nRight and you know say excuse me Harvard University um\nYou know asked me to call 'em in June they were you know if those were allegedly a allegedly many Asian Americans didn't do the you know if I'm On a religious action\nOne of the oh help out a little bit what happens is these dogs did it in their heads that is to society has five percent Asian that's all you can have at Harvard and if it's got twelve or Thirteen percent black you have to have that and if it's if it's you know forty percent Hispanic or thirty whatever you got to go there\nThen it can be more than you know thirty or forty to forty percent white and if you do anything different than map and suddenly you're ...\nThey could fix that would change the admissions process by giving people will point to happen to be black taking points away if you have to be Asian and that's of course unfair now the court system so far they said they were allowed to do that with Kevin on the court I guess the fear is that he's actually going to make it I was just crazy but based on how how how a qualified you are\nBased on your actual test scores instead of basing it on somebody's getting told their back rather up this will be there for their heritage right\nRight next to me ... and so now there but I'm not a bad move by the way the loop than what forty miles north of where I'm sitting right now these books are actually the taxes so that they put out an op ed saying oh horrible will be who's going to take away the rights of anybody other than white men I guess\nYeah and I think there's a ... a team in a\nWay uh uh the fact that he has shown support you have to support and other Supreme Court justices um who are you know who don't support affirmative action um you know a University in Michigan but ultimately in there\nThat they actually weren't able to justify\nUm that reason are being strong enough or you know him to not be around a\nBit worried but couldn't justify because it's stupid or it is a ...

be hurt 'em there's a lot of people have an opinion on this let me go to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to our Charles in San Antonio Charles what's up\n[noise] how's it going John looting I mean I I wanted to look at that you know that I was twenty but same\nCircumstances you did with my old man made him didn't see eye to eye but eventually I worked it out before we you know he passed on but yeah and my mom was left a widowed at so that's why I stayed right and it wasn't until my sister had divorced and she moved back here whether you know that's why I stayed so long but it's true what they said\nI think a lot of these people are seeing that every marriage is not I don't even know why anybody gets married anymore because it doesn't last\nSo that's my opinion ... broke up what you said how old you are when you moved out how old were you\nI was twenty eight\nOr Twenty years when you moved down to twenty you because you won't get along with your dad\nNo no I I I I stayed because I was in college I had to live under the under their rules writer I liked it or not right okay\nSo I was forced to swallow my pride but then me and my dad started working it out and then that Chile he passed away when I was twenty six ... at that point you know my mom was widowed by herself I stayed with her and tell my sister got divorced and then you know she moved back in or you aren't monitored not an area you know oh yeah\nOh yeah you are not remarried already for thirty five year yeah I didn't learn thirty five\nYear All right so you're saying the difference between our generation to generation now is that today they're saying why even bother 'cause nobody stays together but but you obviously you're an example of somebody who does\nExactly but ... now not everybody shares our beliefs believe it or not especially the millennials especially the Obama the lady oh\nWhy don't I don't think they're taught not to because the belief system used to be pretty universal in this country suddenly we're raising a generation of people that just don't even have that same values has to be it's weird it's Charles nice for the phone call it's very odd to me it just ... we're we're in a different place now let me go to a total of Minnesota Tony what's up\n[noise] hey how's it going man living dream dude what's up yeah get some comments for yet so I'm\nI was thinking to myself and kind of an example you know before I really wanted to really meet anybody I wanted to figure out myself first right\nYou know go to school start a business getting a good job all that stuff to move out kind of get settled in and then start looking however it while you're starting to see a lot of millennials you know and myself you know you have all these apps on the phone all the dating apps it's like you can get a shop\nYou know for whatever you're looking for you can go on a date um\nMeet somebody you know and you can decide yeah this person's called his personal plot and they kinda just move on you know and it was interesting is that actually after I got all off of all of this crap I'm you know I met somebody or daily and um I'll probably marry this woman\n... well what does organically look like in twenty Eighteen how do you mean\nIt's the solution kind of just like your I Would say like just through your friends you know you know somebody who knows somebody else who was on you know one of these dating apps and they're just kind of striking out\nOr you know they're just sick of kind of get a plate and you just kind of meet somebody who has gone through the same thing as you write like well let's get off this crap but let's just go out together and have a good time and see where it goes so you\nKind of have to go you kinda have to go through\nYou know going out I'll tell you at nine times out of ten of millennial they'd been on one of these apps are associated at times and after they kind of experience it and realize that there's not much good stuff out there they get off of it and then they just need people the way that people used to me you know through friends hanging out a\nLoan that is to try to ensure away and then my opinion\nBy oh gotcha and I hear you and I think that people should do it organically like that you actually meet somebody face to face or you meet somebody at work you meet somebody I mean it used to be a church right or or you meet somebody ... you actually meet somebody did you get to get to see the look on their ... their face in their expression when they're writing to you or\nOr ... you know you get to hear their sarcasm where you get to\nSee the way they smile or there's a twinkle in there I just it's the old way of doing it\nBut I guess in today's day and age and of course I've never been an ... dating apps but you could swipe one way do you like the person's wife the other way to get rid of them I mean it's it's it's it's kind of mess we use it as\nIt is I don't know how they do it I don't I don't like that I don't know how you date today doing all that I'm On social media and again shopping [laughter] no I don't like it\nOr who who says that that pictures real anyway smoke shop couldn't care to Brazil look anything like what happened right actually meet somebody and then figure out of your attracted or if you like\nTo have you on you build a moron that's an I imagine a cup of coffee or something it'd be Cruz's old fashioned Ninety I like it\nWould be very quickly go to a CD or going to be accused of city and Patrick ... got like a minute maybe they haven't\nGotten our Joe thanks for your let me ask you about you know I I was ... I was born in eighty one I've been married Thirteen Years cool my brother was born in eighty eight\nGoing to say somewhere between Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty eight we started telling kids that you can get participation groceries and sports life and your your work doesn't matter for an outcome so they have unrealistic expectations of what their new place to look like\nAnd they just moved up their parents delay until they get what they think works and it takes 'til they're twenty eight or thirty eight that's what it takes\nWell clearly in your house that was the timeline I don't know if that's the time on everywhere but I think that makes a lot of sense to me there's something has changed to where you know ... it went from practice as hard as you can and you'll be able to win a trophy and whatever sport is that you chose or you know a few years later it was just going to show up and if you don't get a trophy all yell at the at the coach and shoot a league\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fed some deregulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy or that had been held back because the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something\nLike that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet\nAnd in that regard I have to tell you this is really for found two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in and income or into a household and then what goes out for allegations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household networks in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred\nTrillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better salesman they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat\nThan they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash 'em but you know what the media does the media has to find if it if it bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's where the leading with it\nBut when people generally watch or when you when you talk to your investors the people that that you work with or do they call you immediately say oh my God what are we do or\nOr do they say well it's kinda crazy going to go out to eat now\nYeah so [laughter] you know what I mean nobody causes nobody calls me with a debtor plant [laughter]\nI'm gonna I'm gonna from now on but the British it at all um\nSo I Do get some people are concerned of course in that apprehension that's obvious and makes sense logical also get folks on the other side that are looking to do some buying but let me give you a little perspective so the market bottomed in March of overnight and so we I was following the meltdown of ... we have had this\nAt twenty three now correction sense over nine five percent or more and they average I sent this out the clients this morning just to give some perspective [noise] twenty three times since nine that what we're going through right now is happen average decline is nine point three percent were down about six or seven now\nUm but even today Joe I'm now seeing on my screen as I'm watching\nA in real time we're starting to see some of the stocks the leaders\nAh which were technology these are the names we all know Amazon Microsoft Apple Facebook companies um\nWe're down early today than down hard this month\nBut now starting to sure I mean Facebook as an example and this is not a recommendation on Facebook but the shock was in August\nThat over two hundred and ten dollars a share today is traded in the fifties now it was read earlier down on the day but now it's green Microsoft same thing it was lower early today now that's turned up so it looks like\nWe're starting to see a little bit of selective buying the average stock and this ... needles moving but the average stocks since this sell off happen is down about Fifteen Percent\nWell for the big correction yeah now here's the\nThing to you mentioned this it kind of in passing is too expensive is it over done the market is trading at about the price to earnings ratio which that's just simply the price divided by earnings it's about sixteen probably right today's sixteen point to sixteen point three the twenty five year average sixteen point one\nSo it's right where he says it's ... years yeah you're not cheap so it's not like oh nine when everything was on sale\nBut you're certainly not at twenty three twenty four times what you're saying jeez were forty percent overvalued no we're smack at the twenty five year average right now\nIt is I Do gather managing director and senior vice president Raymond James and associates a always incredible knowledge let me ask you something off the beaten path and you know for Twenty one years no do you tell them you know smart as you so you're about to prove it here I'm\nGoing as partly what I Do write a gas prices go down we're happy\nGas prices go down because the price per barrel goes down so we're happy with the gospel\nWith the price per barrel goes down with the stock market generally speaking goes down and we're all supposed to freak out and be angry that that the stock market is going down so again maybe maybe it's just completely outlandish but should we get to the point to where we don't have these valuable resources\nLike gasoline like liquefied natural gas like\nFill in the ... you know I'm I'm utility that we all need\nMaybe we don't have those on the stock market and the reason why I say that is we're happy when the prices go down with the prices will go down with stock market goes down is I Would guess and it could be wrong but it's rare to see the price per barrel of gas go down and the stock market go up\nSo how do you feel is somebody who does this for a living and you've done for as long as I've known you when you do it very well how do you feel about those being connected is it right just to have gasoline per barrel and the stock market or or not because again it seems to be the opposite of what I Want I Want lower gas prices but I Want my stocks to be well\nYeah it's a ... that's an interesting question so you you really can't\nSeparate those for a couple of different reasons a number one is you have companies like Chevron and Exxon as an example yeah I'm right there publicly traded so they're going to be on the exchange just like home depot and apple are going to be on the exchange she'll have that\nThe commodity itself um oil in this case or natural gas as you were mentioning those are the importance of course into a lot of different products right hand so you have to have a market price I mean if you look at commodities you can buy cattle hogs oil natural gas platinum played in ...\nIt's all out there with a ... I Want to I Want to enter I Would interject this though 'cause I I see where you're going to make\nSense but like you brought up apple let's talk about apple I've got an iPhone or I Want to go by the new iPhone right\nAn apple stock dumped today Fifteen Percent they're not going to drop the price of the iPhone tomorrow because their stock price went down but at the price per barrel of oil goes down to the stock prices go down to those oil companies I Am going to pay pay less for it at the gas pump that so I guess my question is\nIs it okay that's what we actually pay as a consumer seems to be directly tied to the price per barrel which is for some reason in flux because of what's happening with stock market maybe\nI vote is going to change price because apple gained or lost money today by phone as the iPhone that is what it costs that's what the plan is\nRight [noise] yeah okay so the or let a lithium batteries\nA little smarter than you thought I was a it actually makes no sense whatsoever and I'm trying to [laughter] come on [laughter] uh let me go back home\nCome on yeah yeah yeah so at this year's us dissect the iPhone for an example we all know they have lithium batteries yeah so let's see him as a commodity right um so that's going to trade up and down just like crude oil\nThat's part of the cost structure for Apple now they might do things to hedge that input cost it they think lithium prices are going to run away to the upside\nBecause they don't want the iPhone going for um a thousand twelve hundred just because the battery went up by two hundred but right\nUm so it's kind it's a hard question to answer I think the short answer is no ah oil is part and parcel to the equation\nAre both just as the raw commodity and then all of the ... of that which are directly on energy companies but then more broadly a plastic on an iPhone right yeah well guess what that comes from where oil right so it's just it's it's just there\nWhy the capitalism effect that I think the right answer is from the dumb guy perspective here the right answer is apple already mark set up by a hundred percent so if they're only making Ninety five percent markup I think they're still gonna be okay and that really is true it cost them exactly half\nOf what of what they're charging for an iPhone so I guess where you've got that kind of wiggle room you can you can survive it the next time we speak give me a favor let's talk about why are the price per barrel of oil is it lower for us specifically when we're exporting now more than we've ever\nExported and we're actually exporting now more than we're importing had a great question from a caller yesterday who said it where they got all this oil why we keep on exporting it let's just keep it refined at ourselves and I know that it's a it's a global market that's why but maybe you can break down exactly how that works next time can we do that\nYeah you bet that's eating All right it is um duck or it's not easy easy is not easy for them for the layman over here All right it's got to use the managing director senior vice president of investments Raymond James and associates Doug always right now there's things

Oregon question yeah\nYeah super men in all of our imperfections\nYou don't want to feel like you're something less than yourself and we're wired that way we want to be in charge you want to move forward men have a drive and they want to be seen as leading and ice\nYeah and I think ... may have\nTipped off something there again political optics political and cultural sensations drive the end result of politics and this if there is indeed a red wave and these midterms\nIt will be driven in part by moments that we saw yesterday and moments and observations like this it's something instinctive people don't like the way they feel when they listen to some of this stuff and this is why I Believe Hillary Clinton's campaign fell flat\nFelt like you know men were being forced to drink soy all day\nAnd they felt awful about themselves the me too movement is also had many victories it's great that that accusers can come forward and tell their stories and if they're true the guy should be thrown in jail if the statute of limitations not in place\nBut it is also unleashed a kind of toxicity between the sexes and the feeling that all men are predators and that all men should be somehow beaten into a corner and are asking girls or dance or a offering to take her out for drinks is somehow enacted sexual assault\nMen do feel that that's part of their conversation everyday to Tony Texas you wanted to say what\n[noise] ah one thing I think that is being overlooked for chicken or the by the mainstream media is that Jim Brown or they're supporting Kanye Jim Brown is a highly\nRespected individual on the black community he is opinionated and outspoken and the fact that he supported\nA ... and had some very nice things to say about president after the meeting is something I think that is\nPerhaps as significant or even more significant that Conyers because of the impact of Jim Brown throughout\nNot only the black community but the white community as well\nMhm well the general for ... yeah I agree I think that you know both of these figures represent in the in the arena of sports as well as the music and and pop culture\nThese are two huge influence there's huge\nOr let's go to David Illinois why\nDo you think everybody so up in arms and angry about this all meet and greet and\nA wife or a man I I think the dams has gotten so filled with hate and anger and that's been embraced by the media\nThey slipped and they've exposed they how they really believe blacks are supposed to be have if you do not preach their point of view your racial turned coast\nYeah no it's it's a I have to tell you\nI was imagining as I was listening to this what if someone were directing this kind of thing toward me and using such personal term your house slave you're negro who's not reading they said to him\nI mean this is it's so personal and nasty and beside the point so you can't have a black person sit\nOn an IV equals footing after resolute desk and have a conversation with the president of the United states or your derided as a house life\nThat\nFound that so offensive and on any other day and the other person sitting there that's what the reaction would have been in the media but the moment someone\nHey any other person sitting there that's what the reaction would have been in the media but the moment someone makes another political decision for themselves and decides to talk to a Republican president in this case someone they deeply load\nAll the tables get turned all the rules are thrown out and you can hurl invective racism\nOr hatred mental deficiency you're a lunatic you're ugly and your music bad we ate your wife me throw that think that the guy we will get into all of this more of your calls and as I keep promising to Connors rebooting without Roseanne will you watch\nAnd I'll tell you with ABC executives is saying behind the scenes\nRaymond ... sitting in front of the great lady Laura Ingraham be right back\n[noise]\n\n\nTonight ten nine central long ABC finish the sentence for me millennia Trump is the first lady the interview Ken women in the me too movement call you a supporter of no question is off limits you're not the first first lady to\nLet's go to be in Colorado you wanted to say what about Kanye West blaming I was\nWatching the clip of comedy on Laura show and something struck me as a possible truce I think we've reached a point where\nCNN's ratings are higher on the secondary media market than they are in the primary [laughter] meaning\nYou're making the anger in point Laura always says why are we playing Don Lemon he's getting more viewers on my show than he's ever had on his [laughter] that's the point you're making right\nOnly take about forty seven seconds ... and and I see more of your show you know edit it down to the nuggets of hate and bitterness and envy and ... and the things they despise so much on other shows I think they've reached the point where\nSo few people are watching but they're paying attention playing it I'll swear\nOr to show exactly how hateful they are and how out of touch\nTheir ratings are lower than the food network people like tiny are reaching an audience\nAnd they're bitter and angry about it and it's it's quite amazing\nYeah no that that there there is reality there there is truth there um I thank you for the call but\nThere there's no doubt I mean you look at the ratings CNN is just\nIt's tragic I mean it's really tragic and on big nights like during the cabinet battle and things that they were they were really hurting I mean in comparison to Fox Fox was having four six million people watching and CNN had a half a million people\nVery interesting what's happening out there but again it's that runs been exactly what I was saying a moment ago\nThese elites think they will tell the public what they want and if they keep doing it the public will have nowhere to go but to them the public will eventually get the genius and keep watching it doesn't work that way\nProgramming no longer works that way and there are no longer three networks that hold the monopoly on oil eyeballs in the country\nAnd whether it's the people programming ABC with this Roseanne rebuild or the folks that CNN shoving Don Lemon down people's throats I just don't think it works\nIt ... it doesn't matter what I think it doesn't work demonstrably probably does not work Chris New Jersey you wanted to say what\nI like all day at the Democrat and an aunt who looked at the low but doesn't agree with their train of thought on the phone call on the\nOn the on the young or ... or whatever I\nDon't know how to do that in a way that the vote a certain way again like we're looking at is how you know the poets out then they got like a ...\n... you know is that not only the media ... an e than at\nAll oh that's all they got a\nGreat point great point Chris and it's great and important that you are thinking for yourself thinking outside of whatever identity uh\nGreat and important that you are thinking for yourself thinking outside of whatever identity a shtick you're supposed to be exemplify and because of your race or your sexuality or whatever\nWe all should be thinking for ourselves we all should be free to move to the right or left but ... to to come script a whole race of people because of the color of their skin I'm Sorry that wasn't Martin Luther king's dream\nThat shouldn't be the aspiration of uh people a free people\nI I and and frankly listening to the hatred the racist hatred coming from even members of Kanye West west own race it's appalling what Don Lemon said yesterday and I'm In a play it for you um he invoked Conyers mother\nWhich I thought it was particularly egregious listen\nWe need to take the cameras away from Tanya a and from a lot of this craziness that happens in the White House because it is not normal this was an embarrassment Conyers mother is rolling over in her grave she would be terribly disturbed by this in Congress has not been the same since his mother died\nThank you Dr now he's a psychiatrist now you can plumbed the depths of Kanye West's mind and heart and his grief apparently Wendy Georgia you wanted to comment on this your reaction\nYeah even more so to me than the dead mother thing there is another ... comment and it was take the cameras away from Tanya a and the White House because I Believe what happened yesterday was so powerful to build upon what dominance ... and other people\nThey have started to pull back the curtain and twenty five minutes yesterday 'cause I watched the whole thing I wanted to know exactly what went down and twenty five minute congregate open that carton about twenty five more fate\nMhm well that's the danger here and I do think\nHe was he was being very vulnerable in front of all those cameras and ... to ... to ... Don lemons point CNN was running the event live to just like everybody else they were desperate for every moment they were not going to miss Kanye West meeting with Donald Trump\nIt was a big moment it was a big moment\nSo to say take the cameras away spare me okay then you you go back to talking about you know the trade surplus in Indonesia on CNN International and we'll watch ratings continue to crater lower than they are no\nBut I you know I see I Want more cameras I Want to see more I Want to see the other side of crazy I Want to see the cameras on Capitol Hill and the lobbyists shaping our our our every bill and pushing legislation that the American people don't want let's see that\nYou want to public service let's show that crazy\nSee we ... we hyped but we also hyper focus I think all things like this this is important to the African American vote as a bloc it's very important because a major influential are agents of influence in the middle of that community\nHas decided to come out and say you know what I think differently from what I'm supposed to think I'm gonna right outside the lines here and that is dangerous tall dangerous chalk but\nBeneath that was something else there was a cultural critic about something happening in the black community about father listening about what it means to be a man and not only in the black community in the wider community as well thank you for that call um I Know I wanted to talk to Capt\nTo be a man and not only in the black community in the wider community as well thank you for that call um I Know I wanted to talk to the cat in Kansas and our cat you're in the mid west\nOr the Roseanne show was originally designed to appeal to people like you and that is where the heart of\nThe viewership for that show came from and I think returned when it re booted some of the highest ratings of the last year without Roseanne will you watch the Connors and why not\nFor now I Will not I I Can't say that daughter ours all I'd like John that way and I don't mind her sister but I what that were saying that she was the center of the whole show without her that show was ...\nAnd I felt bad for jobs that just for staying there I feel like he is kind of a oh by itself fair\nBut I I Will I Will watch it basically because of how they treated Roseanne and they I don't I Can't stand ... daughter first\n[laughter] well I think you know John Goodman in in um\nInterviews has said you know I think my character is going to spend most of the season moping around a you know feeling sorry because he lost his wife\nAnd I think that's probably right that look there's no reason for the show to go on without Roseanne that's the reality\nThe only reason is ABC was already out of pocket\nSo they were either going to do some show with these people or they were just going to be right paychecks of these folks go off and have a vacation but they were on the hook so that's why the Conner says going forward but is it going to die you bet I think it will be canceled after a few shows that's my production will see\nLike a cat for the call mark Florida you wanted to say what then we'll go to a break in a moment\n[noise] yeah right I mean if you recall back er during Katrina Tanya way kind of in West spoke out against Trump\nOr I'm Sorry against the Bush and that uh he hit me at it but yeah to black people and uh now it's just amazing a ... and now that he's a a for crop all of a sudden I got a mental illness and now it's down believable\nNo no well this is again that because as as one of the caller said earlier it's almost like stromboli in in ... when the puppet is doing what you want it to do yes yes this is great when the puppet cuts the strings then it's a problem\nLook I I ... and this is why I'm not saying Kanye West is you know\nA a ... this is he's not Lincoln here let's not get ahead of ourselves\nI think there are people on the right who want to suddenly crown Kanye West is the leader of you know African Americans in in Republican circles well look to somebody like Clarence Thomas or a you know Walter Williams is somebody who really has a\nFull flashed philosophy\nOn politics and race that is informed impassioned and thoughtful I think that's where you look for that kind of leadership so let's not get ahead of our skis here an annoying to Kanye West is somehow the you know sum total of a

Washington DC they seem to think they can get Robert for instance do work to win it's not going to happen\nAgain I might never say never uh till after the election but it's looking bad for his campaign was gonna be thirty million dollars wasted I Hope but um yeah I don't love that outside money can come in and has Ted Cruz got money from outside of Texas yes\nYes he has a and I would not know nowhere near as much as O'Rourke but I Would I Would be perfectly fine with a ruler regulation against regulation generally that says you got to be a resident of the state where where the races happening to donate to that campaign\nOh that's not fair blah blah freedom of speech whatever I hear ya if we can do it and somehow still keep our freedom and liberty I'm open to hearing ideas because I don't like that California can have such an impact on races in states Southern California I don't like that\nAnd and your response could be well you know you could do the same thing you can donate a bunch of money to people in California to help them when\nWe'll probably isn't going to help get rid of mood be probably not going to help to get rid of a I'm a new some will probably will be the next governor of California although it's a pretty tight race to be honest with you with Republican I'm\nFor me I Would like to see the people that are affected and represented\nBy by those who are running I Would like to see them inject the money I Would like to see that I'd like to see it'd be a Texas pays you know of the campaigns of the Texas\nUm candidates likewise in California Maine Florida Hawaii Alaska everywhere because when you can when you could take a Soros and inject a million dollars into a local da race and win that race just by flooding it with money\nOr there's something wrong with that in my opinion\nIs that that some guy on some mountain top somewhere saying I deem bear County Texas to be this and because he has a bunch of money he can make that happen it's interesting to me\nUm it's eight eight nine for one pack Saturday nine four one Seventy four seven Joe pads dot com lots going on today let's start SARS the phone calls me on on free speech Renee why not\nLet's say hello and welcome to I'm Matthew in Tulsa what's happened in Matthew Hi\nHey Joe Happy Friday sir I got ya uh hey you know\nI think one of the best thing first top dollar something that is exposed a whole generation to politics or\nYou know I'm thirty three born and raised in California and never I couldn't tell you the difference between a Republican and Democrat three years ago and then instead of just joining or\nThe Democratic party like ... ... that was popular California I did my research and figure out the different and found that it's common sense to be a conservative yeah or or Republicans right um and then about that Cornel West they I think that\nYou know in that any targets but I Wonder if\nJim ground 'cause there's no coverage about Jim grounding their democratic you know news networks they discovered it was but it ... word for word Jim Brown said the same exact thing that Kanye West that if they would try to destroy like they are currently west where do you think\nJim Brown actually sat silently he's there he's been a supporter of the president he's a supporter of athletes standing for the national anthem uses a supporter of traditional American values and loving the flag\nOr in the anthem so he was there to support but I I Believe when ... got done speaking the president said Jim do you want to say anything [laughter] and Jim Brown and said you know I don't I don't need to [noise] um so they would not attack Jim round the same way um\nJim Brown and said you know I don't I don't need to [noise] um so they would not attack Jim Brown the same way\nUm but at the same time Jim Brown was dinner with Conyers so attacking Tanya and exactly what he stands for what he said really kind of was an attack on Jim Brown\n... it's interesting too I I don't think Jim Brown would have been that guy he's not as demonstrative and not his old age anyway as Kanye West is but he was there in support of it and you'll notice most people acted like he most on the left acted like he wasn't there I agree with you\nExactly and you know a joke around in an interview on Fox News afterwards and pretty much you know into intellectually said the exact same thing they're calling us that do\nYou know uh like you said in support of people standing even talking about a Spike Lee slightly was talking about\nA ... that slavery was a part of our ah our society you know that that's what it was built up so they basically called ... ally well not a liar but we need to get out of this happened thoughts on the future right\nAnd I mean one is because calling us from Chicago\nAnd if anybody that was in Chicago and got out of Chicago and made something of themselves they can easily be turned into a hero is starting in the ghetto or whatever it is getting out of it though [noise] ...\n... ... lives and what kind of West said was absolutely appropriate and that's why my conversation yesterday with Tracy was absolutely appropriate Kanye West is saying I Would rather jobs\nThen jail cells I Would rather we make it here like\nIn Chicago than make it overseas I don't know why\nIt it could be ever deemed as a bad thing when he said\nIn fact it was a very good thing what he said it was pro America pro urban um um areas in our country pro Chicago pro jobs anti crime anti prison\nHow could what he said had been taken as a negative by anyway what was it that they were arguing about and Cary Grant me the wrong I didn't\nI didn't watch or listen to everybody but it appears that beard is though none of them said anything against what he said they just were attacking the fact that he was there I Believe you're right yeah\nAnd again the nachos in a way you call somebody a house negro that's a problem I'm ... and and it's three people on a panel black people on a panel on CNN that's a major problem\nIn other words shut your face get back in line to get back on the plantation and that's not okay\nIt's not and we delve into that a lot with a sheriff

com back at it it's going to be a martyr videos and California Marvin or you donating debate or work\nA job I'm not decided on that yet but of course we're I'm I'm really all in with weight or John ... or the governorship we hope\nYou're getting my hope that happens I really do\n[noise] yeah I Want it to you know I'm a I'm a a fan I'm a conservative many years I I should mention also I'm African American and good heart conservative for many years voted didn't vote for President Obama in both election that I or\nGo to a new lease on our good no no no no more when you stop right there if you're if you're black or African American you are required to vote for Barack Obama what's the matter with you\nWell uh I have to say I did I I uh my conservative values are so strong that I that I that I it forced me to uh to maintain my conservative view\nGod Bless them who think I could be worse than they are they good as your uh made a good thing for himself and didn't take with him when he was telling you what to do good what else\nI Know I wanted to pass on what you said yesterday sure because even though I've been a conservative for many years uh you're discussing yesterday about the admission a guideline the harbor and and you were discussing yes that\nTo you it seemed unfair to admit uh students into Harvard based on anything other than their academic probably see that correct\nNo I said the qualifications but go ahead\nOr they're close to ...\nI I didn't even say the word I don't even though I didn't say the word academic I just said their qualifications would they should admit the most qualified people not people based on their race ethnicity or skin color but go ahead I'm listening\nAll right so now myself is that true or died in the world conservative yeah I totally take a disagreement with you and I think it's you you you have like many people have misunderstood conservative in this\nYeah I totally disagreement with you and I think it's you you you have like many people have misunderstood conservatism\nIn this aspect that conservatives are not really the concept of theater I actually had to take into a colonel [noise]\nThe uh the uh in the ... the the circumstances that a trick a group of people and there's a lot different this is my point Joe my point is simply this mission into Harvard I it's a\nIt's not solely predicated on educational probably to say that it's really any the give it to hold on just to say to say that if you\nAre when I listen to stop for a second I I'd let you on my show number two and a half minutes and you're having several you're trying to say yet just say you're taking me to task or not conservative enough because why just tell me why\nBecause Harvard is does not admit students based on just economic probably because\nThey're not going to crack down on it yeah not economic and go ahead\n[laughter] yes so that's probably because all of these students all we do not receive the care of each other so she'll be even considered for heartburn you're already talking about it that are far above the ...\nSo it was going to lose him sort of my heart Marvin you haven't told me when I'm wrong yet so let me give you an example you're you're you're a black guy I'm a white guy although southern Italian about red white white I'm more of a something other but either way I'm a white guy you're a black guy we both had the exact same score Harvard says wanted to take the black guy because we don't have enough of him and we're not going to take the white guys that fair\n\nIt's never as simple as that is actually that know what what are all in all of them is the thinking it's never think that there are many subjective things such as well um the the such such as ah ah the sticker that you're up overcome who cares such as\nThe obstacles that will recover now did not stop that doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you had one parent and I had to or if I had one parent and you had to it doesn't matter if I had an army of you hated\nYou would not committed an act like they say they don't get no doesn't matter that here's what I'm telling you about that\nYou're not listening Harvard is making it that simple would harbor is saying is quite literally this we have too many Asian people going to school here because of that we're going to grade Asians lower for admissions and great other than Asians higher specifically Hispanics and blacks\nThat's really what they're saying they're not saying because you can't know Marvin stop let me finish they're not saying because Asians had a better life they're not saying because blacks are generally speaking come from lower income they're saying we're doing that\nBecause there are too many ethnic or racially Asian people in our school and it's not fair now I'll hear you tell me why that's an okay thing to go by because that's really what they're saying that\nYou don't want they they feel if you would simply ask yourself why do colleges ask you what is your community service why is that important that it is pretty important because at a certain level all of the students are made of exactly the same\nWith Martin would I don't understand is why we don't understand is why you're not listening to me Harvard hasn't said anything about community service about your plate in life about your road to get their Harvard is only making the decision on whether you're Asian or you're not Asian back quite literally use the case so you're making something that it's not\nSo let me ask you again do you think it's okay for Harvard to say this race of people is too widely represented in my school so we're going to turn on\nYeah and do you think it's okay for Harvard to say this race of people is too widely represented in my school so we're going to turn a demo way simply because that's their background you think that's okay\nI said earlier not that kind of further\nWell they are not even for a second you're not a conservative that believes in competition I got to leave that as I listen to me you're not somebody who believes that we should gained the fruits of our labor you're somebody who sees or skin color first that's okay you're allowed to but you're not a conservative\nBut do you think I mean in Santa Ana I'm telling you restoring order them and I'm\nTelling ya ya story yet I I've studied the case this is about Asians it's not about anything else\nBut you see what I'm saying that I'm not denying I'll probably spend\nThe rest they are higher education yesterday or the other thing I can I use their ... to go through any of the stock market and an hour but I'm going\nI'm going to let you go but before I Do I Want you to tell the United states of America right now Joe packs just kick my ass go ahead and say that\nI Would say that not not even all\nTheir lives I look at like a brother but you're dead wrong in this one got up my phone was Marvin is a great guy carry but but I I'm not it was misrepresenting the story out of out of Harvard isn't that exactly\nWhat you're saying yeah I Believe you're right yeah was it a Community Survey you asked that was it about what neighborhood you came from ...", "city":
