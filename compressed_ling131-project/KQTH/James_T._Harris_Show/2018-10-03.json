it always comes back\n\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule I care once in a while ago\nI was walking and find that site right right and I don't know what happened I had the after effects of that in my hand and my late and I noticed that I accept that it I don't have that anymore\nAnd that would bring the economy to a standstill so these these folks that are running on the left shouldn't get a bike first base and they're getting a look just ... they have so much money coming in from ... blue and so that's our challenge right now it's just getting the the facts out like you said or as you open\nWhat is a act blew\nA that's just a big nationwide you know Democrats fundraising peace they have Republicans don't have that they do Republicans do it more in the party Democrats bundle they you know they're billionaires lined up across the country and then they bundle it all to their preferred candidates by state\nAnd so my opponent for example just write seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year in August alone in one month which is just unheard of races in the past never cost that much into Democrats are raising their hand over fist they don't on policy we would win eighty twenty\nBut they they just are going off you know she's running commercials that I'm against pre existing conditions and has a very emotional piece a with a young boy in medical coverage et cetera except the whole piece is just utterly falls and they're doing that to all candidates across the country they're referring to a procedural vote before we voted for Republican\nA healthcare piece that did have pre existing conditions and so they're just it's it's a lie of the first order a and they're doing it across the board and so we we've got to get the word out to voters and so folks out there you know look up date ... dot com and help me out if you can't\nYeah Dave rent dot com everyone go there ah contribute to this campaign because Republicans are being outspent because we have mega billionaires led by siren George Soros is the Washington Free beacon pointed out a few days ago\nRolling out huge amounts of money for state focus donations for campaigns excuse me\nAnd they know it it just comes down to turn out in mid term race that comes out to turn out in energy\nAnd Donald Trump demonstrated I think very well that\nIt's not just you know it's not just uh how much money you spend on advertising however uh it it ... it matters that you get air time it matters that you are fighting for the people against these types of August tactics\nAre on the left or this these vicious intimidation campaigns the demonization of boys and men and brothers and fathers and husbands and I would stick to all those issues congressman because I think this I think this is Brett Kavanaugh issue\nThough you're in the house and it's all determined in the Senate I think it cuts across party lines and I think it it is an awakening for Republicans this midterm election cycle your thoughts\nYeah no you're you're right on the ... I I Want without wandering it a path\nBut this one the millions and billions being spent and then the tactics that you mentioned my town hall there they seven hundred activists came up from the laugh swearing up a pastor as he gave the opening prayer at my last town hall it's all on video people go Google it and that people just ... door walkers were spanberger\nA campaign just left a piece on my house my daughter is home alone for people show up at the door looking at my windows taking pictures walking around my house and leave a piece of ... health day that my daughter has to retrieve you know half hour later she stayed in the house that go out that God\nUh and then the young man that was busted we have video of all of it ends up talking to spanberger within a half hour and so I you know what do you conclude from that uh it it's not good out that there there you know patient people\nStop talking to spanberger within a half hour and so I you know I what do you conclude from that uh it it's not good out their their their you know chasing people at a restaurant or no due process or in it it's the leftist fighting with tactics we've just never seen before and especially on the fundraising\nIt's oh get out there no matter where you are in this country and support does support the good conservatives are that are out there running because they need help right now there's a lot of folks\nAre that are deep down in numbers I'm running a tight one and so all they need help too but uh it just ... you're right or we just need to stay on message at\nOne of the biggest thing Iran I was immigration and the left there's nothing that separates that the mainstream voting rights or Seventy eighty percent issue the left right and I was for open borders\nA sanctuary city is no rule of law that they're they're running as moderates but they're left of JFK by a mile and so that's the big new change\nYeah it's a radical you know we have ... real results in this Republican a majority the results versus radicalism\nIt's yeah in fact her ceilings it's information over intimidation results over ... over and over and over again\nYeah GDP is four point to right now it's going to be over four and a half but it's ... it's like Kennedy achieve what you did your Kennedy did supplies I\nBut I Will tell you David or they don't tell you this and I tell us on my Republican friends running numbers don't make it numbers there's a reason your opponent is doing a commercial with a a with a medically challenge child\nIt's about a motion and they say you have the emotional argument is your father is your son's your brothers and real victims of sexual assault has been or have been you have ... are in jeopardy because of what's happened in Washington\nAnd and yeah well that that's right that's what you need I mean the numbers are you know that's it's great\nBut you get people to outlaw hung up on a motion was\nGoing with that my my opponent said don't don't look at the numbers are skinny number and my response to that air go look at a hundred billion Walmart shoppers\nWho's sales are through the roof and then at the kitchen table issues right everybody's life is way better off now everybody two thousand bucks back in the pocket and it it's a family issue it is a kitchen table issue and so they\nAre they're they're running against the good news ah I'm I like where we are but uh\nWe we just got to have all our our entire team start focusing messaging together and like you said we've got to type stories that's where I ended up people\nIs Ryan and raising money for you if if he's raising money just for the a congressional campaign a committee but is he right raising money in part is getting money from them\nYeah yep yep Paul Ryan's or helped out an a a bunch of other outside groups are coming in to help out a thank goodness and so what they're doing that around the country and uh we were we can win and the economy is so fundamental right and it's just it's not just the numbers the\nOptimism every small business I go meet with or buying a new truck or buying a new little piece of capital equipment they're hiring one more person but that's a huge deal most of where I live which has made their small businesses\nAnd they're all at a good mood so it's like you said that the key is they have to get out and vote they cannot stay home we need everybody out everybody not go tell your church your church your business is your sports clubs\nJust all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nFor we're not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward like this was ...\nSports clubs just all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nForward not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward about this was optimistic pro American pro American worker pro manufacturing base\nAnd thank God we have people in Congress like Dave Brat and a President Trump President Trump by the way is in the rose garden yesterday uh oh was it yesterday on Monday started Monday during the NAFTA announcement said this\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they want border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for different reasons 'cause I have some very find people that are running in close races in may affect them and it may not it may be good for them I happen to think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually rightness political calculation is he is he right to put this off though and Republicans until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with a problem in the budget process it we've lost our lab rich right we we let it be known nine Senate Democrats will block\nAnd so right now we don't have at the beginning of the cycle or it after the elections are ... back to a hundred percent\nSo he's probably right on that call and we got to have a fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rallying cries of his election and of mine and the people want to see it\nAnd a nine Senate Democrats ... uh we got to let the world see that and and the whole parties gotta ... behind the president on this immigration issue because it is a big issue that just divides\nThe crony elites up until you say you're from the average person's back in my district that everybody I talked to ... do you want a wall you want to seal the border you want to get rid of\nThe gang activity and it it's not just immigration is tied to the opioid problem Fenton all three hundred billion lethal doses of ... know him across the border this year in one

didn't talk about other anchors I I honestly didn't know that going in and I actually saw that on drugs right before the show okay um but I mean the scope is the scope is the scope I I don't think the

sure do an investigation just you can't talk to the people involved that doesn't make any sense so I don't know how true that is the the veracity of evidence and looking at drudge it says FBI lax approval this is a report lax approval to talk to Kavanaugh and Ford\nUm this was put out by a by Bloomberg and I don't know that I'm buying like I'll be honest with you I don't know that I'm buying

haven't seen that have you\nI haven't I didn't see a press briefing today I'm announcing anywhere else so I but I think it would be that that\nThat would be the top trend I don't think there's any

phone I did\nAt one Eighteen shouldn't bother you I'm no didn't bother me you know the less problem is and bothered then what do you know what the problem is ah why it's called the president's Willard oh like\nOur says ham or\nCome on do common carrier you're with the messengers and a level of rubber room that we don't need to be in this country yeah I think that more important things to worry about\nWas it alert for the White House there for a presidential alert have the president been Brock Obama during the presidential or do what they said look at this guy now bronco bomber was a nurse assistant Liz season arrogant dude but of course he can call it the president's alert I Would not have said boo about that\nStill it sees an arrogant dude but of course he can call it the president's alert I Would not have said boo\nAbout that mhm like a kid we just complain\nAbout things that really deserves some blame him because I don't understand why they call an alert but he sent out a presidential alert\nGuess what those have you on the left he's still your president [laughter]\nAround but it is now you know yeah so you know what I'm saying or your ...\nGirl [noise] your president [laughter] I'm just telling you this stuff that you can do about it let me go to the phone lines to say hello and welcome to ah let me see eye to James who is in Minnesota James what's on your mind Hi\nHey you guys got hammered out well I'm In Minneapolis and thunder storm raged ...\nI Can't hear you just remind my brother just to be what's on your mind\nOkay well you know I'm a Republican or if Trump I listen to your show every day but there's always that's one thing that nobody really seems to talk about and I don't even like to talk about it but\nWhat if Kavanaugh like Trump Donald Trump although the FBI investigations or you know here say or what not what if it turns out that it's true\nWhat do I s again what if what if the Democrats are at what is our next step what a week do you know 'cause we're\nYou know we're pushing against the Democrats right now in on everybody how bad they are and what not but what if we wind up putting him through and I hate to think it\nWas James I'm going to answer your question very simply\nYou it can't be proven true it can't possibly be investigated to an end that proves that the Democrats were right because there's nothing to investigate so even even thinking about the possibility of being true with no cooperation\nEverybody else refuting the claims completely she doesn't know where she was when it was would day what year even how many people were there the names are the ones that she has named of all refuted there's there is no chance\nThat this can be proven to be true\nSo in our system with due process we assume that he's innocent we assume that it's not true until somebody proves a case against him my point is very simple and it's very logical\nThere is no way to prove this to be true not by the evidence that we have now if there's something somewhere that somebody you know has on this that will prove it\nI'll listen and if it proves to be proven will take it down that road but what I just said is is verifiable accurate there is no way to prove this allegation probably why the allegation was was thrown out of knows it can't be proven they just wanted to slow things down would you agree with that\nI Would absolutely\nSo I don't have to get older that it's not clear I appreciate your but it doesn't have to be a consideration because there is no way legally or logically or rationally to say here's why\nThe other line of thought other experts believe that it's the other way around that Syria's actually very important for them or putting because for years has been trying to build Russia's influence in the middle east of course the United states is a fantastic ally in the middle east Israel very powerful having you know weapons seemed to have to try to offset that somehow and I think this really shows us a long term strategy\nFor ... and he is now giving the as three hundred system by the way it's not the newest one Russians have the U.S four hundred which is more advanced so he they're not giving them the new stores\nAre but nevertheless they want to say hey here you go here's this missile system um and hopefully lead them recording thinks this is going to bring Syria some stability so that's his game plan\nNikita with this missile system be an anti Tomahawk missile system because the president or president dropped fifty some odd Tomahawk missiles on Syria when Syria was using chemical weapons against their own people would just stop those missiles there was this sort of anti Israel missile system do we know\n[noise] ah well this missile system is as I said it's not the newest one so the analysis that I've read suggests that even airplanes that operate their Israeli airplanes for example will still be able to evade this missile system they just have to be far more careful about\nHow they operate 'em so it's not the most immediate threats to our operations but it certainly will require us to be far more cautious about what targets we strike and what means we used to strike\nRight it's a quite a bit so I'm Sorry your Makita Vladimir off I'm from the from the Washington Examiner when you bring up Russia we don't talk about the people that much and I ask you about this last time but you'll know benefit\nI'm from ... from Washington Examiner when you bring up Russia we don't talk about the people that much of the ask you about this last time but you'll know better than anybody\nDo the people there like us not like us embryos hate us\nOr think that we're the enemy I Know that during the Cold War we were the enemy we're going to come and kill them at any moment and just like we've we thought the Russians were going to come come and try to kill us at any moment of the Soviets\nWhat are the people fear because from any videos or or any sort of life in Russia I'm I'm sort of things I read about they seem to be modernized they seem to be kind of like us\nYes a it's a mixed bag or my mother actually you mentioned that she just came from Russia visited my grandmother a for a few weeks she just came back yesterday and she was telling me all about the media coverage or the President Trump the United states in ... American relations or it is getting in Russia and surprisingly a has been rather negative\nBut perhaps the ... of the fact that that President Trump has done a lot to represent America's interests and he has pushed back on putting one foot and maybe solve that President Trump would be a week so this just goes to show that this administration has done a lot there but a lot of this negative anti American sentiment in Russia comes from propaganda\nLamb recruiting for years it's a state owned media network there in Russia\nYou know we wanted to make at all can you not be an independent journalist there\nUh well the very few I Would say the biggest difference between\nRussia and the United states is in the United states or you can be a journalist and you can get rich but criticizing the president right but in Russia more he's getting rich by a by burying critical journalists to show that they're right there you go so there's a lot of uh there are some small publication but they'd never get a chance to really fully develop\nSo that people bury their opinion about skews it really based on who we are it's based on what the government tells them we are\nHere for the most part it unfortunately that is true because as I said there's simply not enough alternative media to push back against the governments there a narrative now\nA lot of people do understand that a lot of the information that they are getting a from the state controlled media apparatus is false and it is propaganda um but unfortunately uh I Would like to see that number um become much larger in the future\nIf you'd have a lot of beer off user contribute to the Washington Examiner and and from Russia originally is Russia only aligned with Iran because we aligned with Iraq you know in that war is Russia only aligned with Syria because we're aligned with Israel is it really Russia reacting to who it is that we're aligned with ... and ... maybe even broader than that\nWhy aren't we why aren't we a little closer why are we are like minded we we both teamed up against against Hitler and another we immediately started separating whatever the whatever the benefits were of the way to go to war\nBut why are we more like minded why is it why is it always that we shouldn't be an opposing sides of any either civil war war that's going on between countries\n[noise] ah have been searching for the answer that question for years it just makes sense to me\nA ... it doesn't and at the same time it to me it partially does a I think that we have a lot of common but I also think that we have parallel dusting is Russia and the United states\nFrom the very beginning if we take a look at uh the founding of this nation many Americans do not know that Catherine the great was negotiating behind the scenes with England to actually sent as many as thirty thousand troops to offset the French influence in the revolutionary war from the very beginning or I'm\nJust actually wasn't always that can be opposing side I Know that really Russia was going to who's going to you know it was going to counterbalance phrases help\nAbsolutely it'll negotiations were on the table twice in the first time she actually\nChanged her mind said oh that was an air and translation the second time the\nThe Asians were on the table twice in the first time she actually\nChanged her mind said oh that was an air and translation the second time the agreement was on the table but French have learned of Russia's plans and they said look Catherine the great if you're sending a fleet of going to be intercept that it will never make it to the north American shores\nAnd so Catherine decided that it's not worth it shed a lot of trade agreements going on that she didn't want to violate rake she decided to remain peaceful so but it it just shows you that\nThat type of history that we had from the very beginning really set the tone for the rest now you do mention mentioned interesting point about World War two\nUm yes Russia and\nAmerica fought alongside in World War two of course of the Soviet Union at the time and many of our soldiers died alongside one another but even if you take a look at the type of conflict that was happening or Russia really was mainly operating in their sphere and the United states was was fighting against Japan and there was not a lot of overlap\nAnd of course there were two fantastically different ideologies which explains the fact that after the war ended we immediately went into the Cold War because\nWe always thought it was on line to building walls and saying well this is ours that yours or this is free and this isn't free it's very strange that you would think that that that we would sit down and say you know\nAfter what we just saw um Hitler do let's make sure that doesn't happen again let's just leave Germany you know a one country and free let's not break up you know a check in the Czech Republic and Slovakia the whole thing is to me is just very strange\nBecause we have a like minded goal would be a war which was let's do what we can for the survival of our people\nMhm no I agree with you and I mean look I agree with you with a broader point I think we should be friends and we should try to become friends that's why I Walk on President Trump's\nA you know messaging and hope that we can one day a enter a detente with Russia um whether or not within will be willing to do that our whenever wouldn't leaves whether or not um the next leader of Russia will be um anti American\nLast question for a new to the bureau of he of course in the Washington Examiner I'm a I Know that you don't have the details on this but in a very broad view\nIs Russia through the propaganda that you spoke about through newspapers and television media and so on are they doing the same sort of thing in your opinion to propagandize what's happening politically here in this country through Twitter where anybody anywhere can jump on a website\nAnd try to affect the outcome of elections like the senatorial race here in Texas between uh this guy Robert phrases over ... calls himself ... and and Ted Cruz do you believe that Russia has some sort of a a want a desire to jump into the fray and mix things up and make us hate each other here\n[noise] uh maybe uh unfortunately decision America has become so politicized where it's difficult to draw objective analysis and you actually look at the ... objectively because liberals have literally hijack that they're using it to undermine a president's election they're using it to undermine or his administration and that's very very unfortunate\nI think Russia is a certain extent as far as their long term strategy is concerned\nUh will be interested interested in these stabilizing the United states right um um how far they're willing to go in order to make that happen I don't know uh and I would like to see more research um perhaps intelligence reports on that matter but uh I think it's possible\n... it's a very interesting because so some news story last night that suggested that was going on and ... into some level they've always try to use the propaganda against us I just wonder if this new way of doing it digitally um is happening as well do you watch soccer getting very soon I always appreciate their knowledge\nAbsolutely thanks for having now and again\nThe key to Vladimir off you use that contributed to the Washington Examiner we're back after this and the Joe ... chose the writer [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nIn many
