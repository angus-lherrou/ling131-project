been a lot of followers on Twitter so he doesn't flood with two people say that Russia has been saying the same thing\nA Rush Limbaugh certainly a guy who gets to write a lot of these the king of this format radio but I listen to rush every day I'm just as you've probably never listen to me I'm ... and and I don't expect that he wouldn't um\nToby in crosshairs ties to Saudi intelligence Muslim Brotherhood and political activism may have led to journalists disappearance now again we know now that he's dead Saudi Arabians admit that he's dead how he died they claim they're some fight or something who knows\nThis written by a person in guy Taylor\nOver the Washington Times the prevailing narrative about the bizarre case of us may Saudi journalist Jamal ... is that Saudi Arabia is hard charging young crown prince ordered him kidnapped and perhaps killed in order to Simon say particularly effective critic\nWho wrote widely read disparaging columns about the royal family and the crown prince his own ambitious reform agenda but Middle Eastern center said some deeper supplies played into the district to show these disappearance stemming from his long career political activism ties the Saudi intelligence and Mr to show these past relationship with the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood\nBasically show the fifty nine years old he disappeared at the Saudi conflict new stumble on October second is said to have withdrawn years ago from any formal affiliation with the Brotherhood but his past ties to the trains national Islamic group are believed to have been a source of distress for Saudi ... a crown prince\nMohammed bin some on the thirty three year old print sprinted the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and one of his signature moves as air to the Saudi throne was to cut all ties with the rival Gulf nation of Qatar the prince blames do offer financing the Muslim Brotherhood and to foment unrest\nI guess the powers that are better be across the Arab world in particular Saudi Arabia\nIs leading Saudi Arabia for self imposed exile in the U.S last year and the strictest show he has worked to create an advocacy group called democracy for the Arab world now dawn to promote Arab Spring style freedom movements\nAcross the middle east All right so as I Walk away from this\nI said to myself okay here's a news source of the Washington Times that says there was a Muslim Brotherhood connection\nHere's a new source of the Washington Times it says that he was critical of the reforms that his crown prince wanted to put in place that those reforms are in fact pushing away from from Islamic law ... and as I read this it also seems to say that he was he was for democracy\nIn the middle east so I'm Still confused\nNow lead you to call in and try to an confuse me because again I'm going to go by viable news sources so what I have is people telling me rush said that this guy was ... was pro Islamic rule would have got here is the Washington Times saying he was critical of the reforms that would seem they seem to coincide makes sense\nAnd then I've got but I also have the same story saying that this guy was promoting um democracy in the middle east\nI mean\nThat that's interesting to me the last sentence there's some say Muhammad who was a reputation for quickly identifying new crushing any threats to his authority was well aware of Mr ... political activists or activities and likely more concerned about them than his journalistic effort as a columnist\nFor the Washington Post so there could be something here beneath the surface that we don't know about\nThe suggestion here by this writer is that this was not about journalism is was about his activism and its activity about promoting an Arab Spring like a movement in in the middle east by the way and it got to know anything that has got a road but anybody who wants more Arab Spring is an idiot\nI don't think he's getting killed oh you should die because you say that but the Arab Spring was a horrible mess it melted down the entire region this was promoted by supported by Obama it was horrible it was horrible it was the worst thing that could have happened in that region\nIn fact the military had to take over Egypt I'm from the Muslim Brotherhood because of how horrible it was they were they were there were instituting um sharia law immediately Islamic law immediately and the military says screw that we're not going to stand by like you do that and they took back over so it's an interesting story certainly\nI'm sure your law immediately Islamic law immediately and the military said screw that we're not going to stand by what you do them they took back over so it's an interesting story certainly does President Trump to do with it no that I could I could do\nWas walk you cash for a while with his rights to allege that the son in law the president Jared Kushner David hit list to um\nTo this guy or the crown prince and then the current project I don't know it's disgusting but he said that it should be lost out of office there should be an ethics investigation into walking Castro he should be censored and he should not be reelected\nIn this election coming up he's going to be 'cause San Antonio for some reason loves the Castro brothers doesn't matter what they say or do\nBut that's horrible what are you said it's disgusting and actually I ate at eight nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy two four seven to lose anybody under ... I'm going to go to a bill in Indiana bill I've got literally thirty seconds to make it up and let's go\nYou can't just find any old dude and used to be a Democrat\nOr Republican and point\nThose weren't Dixiecrats right\nYou can't just find any old dude and used to be a Democrat\nOr Republican and point to him that's counter example I'm Talking about the actual members of the Dixie ... party\nThe actual Democrats who voted against the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four the claim of the laugh is that those guys moved over into the Republican camp and I'm saying that that statement is demonstrably historically fall\nIn and out of the thousands that were on the left that were Democrats you show I mean in in the movie prior to boost your what was it six teams but actually moved wasn't even that many\nIn the house and Senate are only won a piece in the in the house and was one guy a Watson or in the Senate it was one guy Strom Thurmond and those are the only two\nDixiecrats who became Republicans are all the other state and lived and died in ... in the Democratic party and I've been lying eyes that Democrats their buildings in Washington DC named after them do\nObviously people like Robert Byrd\nOr what was the guy with not only in the Klan but he filibustered the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four I Believe he's worked for fourteen hours straight or a record and so this these other democratic here but it's just the Democratic party once claimed that now\nThat Hillary Clinton's mentor by the way Robert Byrd it is a bit of extra Sousa go and get the DVD death of the nation if you haven't seen it in the movie theater you've got to go and read the book as well to get everything else that he's done as well it's really a great education every single time and I love when people tell me it's been debunked him and I asked him well which factor exactly\nWell I'm not allowed to ask them I'm not really sure which one it was I'm Talking about Hillary Clinton the top trending thing on drugs today was that she might go for a one more time and twenty twenty\n... the ... delusion here in her or or do the Clintons still have a stronghold on the Democratic party I thought that they were done\nWell they're they're not done I mean he is a proof of that um we've had the me too movement a and it's taken out a number of people\nOn the progressive left noticed and hasn't taken out Bill Clinton or if it had the Clintons could never have announced the speaking to war in which you have to pay hundreds of dollars just to get to hear them\nAs a Bill Clinton continues to meet a certain degree it was an ice in legitimate in the Democratic party how these people are managed to stay one step ahead of the coffee for three decades I I think he got to admire that from a distance between requires an unbelievable what's ...\nYes but also there has to be delusion there she lost she is now I think are approval rating is about thirty thirty five percent something like that which is probably artificially high because of the media that does these things I mean for her to think that she's even still has a has a chance\nAs she told me too movement for his expose her it still doesn't really expose him your right for some reason he's still the golden boy but did expose her horribly for how she treated these women that came forward again with allegations against her husband\nIn this day and age where the leftist pretending they care about women and particularly care about sexual assault how could she ever be prominent again\nFor not ... he got away with it it's really obvious that the last ...\nCare about these things and here's the smoking gun proof of that or just a couple of weeks ago really we heard from Christine Ford about capital and the idea was these women need to be heard we need to have justice for victims of sexual assault all the\nHighest rhetoric now noticed at the moment the cabin outlets confirmed Christine Ford became a non entity articles about her suddenly the whole thing has disappeared suddenly the media and wanting to get justice for the victims of forgotten about all the victims and I'm pretty sure they didn't\nThe whole thing has disappeared suddenly the media and wanting to get justice for the victims of forgotten about all those victims and I'm pretty sure that in probably a few months we'll have difficulty recalling name do and so all of the shows the degree to which these are people who are being used as instruments of\nConvenience the moment they stopped being a human grenade they end up positive safely in the trash\nThat's it's a very good way to put it you're exactly right I mean the fact that find started settled these allegations with this letter for two months and men expose the league turn me when she didn't want it out there shows you exactly how much they don't care about these these victims reviews alleged victims that are coming forward then as soon as a destination\nGoing to get the DVD it's out now do they go to a to death of a nation dot dot com or ... movie dotcom\nDestination movie dot com or you can just order and directly from my tunes any of the places that you get and then eventually later this month you'll be able to get it in red box and Walmart and everywhere when the physical DVDs out that's still a week or so away as I Do the digital downloading and streaming now\nThe media didn't ashes ignoring mostly what's happening in Portland in Portland, Oregon ... which are misnamed it's a misnomer they are the fascists\nIn our society are closing down roads telling people what they can they can do they're pulling people out of cars that are threatening people's lives they're damaging their vehicles and the police are actively standing down and they're being told to stand down by the mayor and those were running that city is this\nJust exactly what we saw eighty years ago were Ninety years ago in in Germany and Italy is this how it starts you shut down roads and let anarchy takeover\nYes\nThe the key to the fascist and Italy and he's ... he's a black I'm a black shirts yeah and then also Hitler's brown insurance is that\nUltimately they were protected by the state uh and eventually they of course when the Nazis took power they merged with the state they became part of the state apparatus or sometimes people will equate I Will say you know and keep it it's not the problem let's remember that there are these white nationalist\nThan they are the real danger I Nine pizzas nearly trying to stop them um and the problem here is that while the white nationalist sub politically and culturally in significant I mean if the if the Ku Klux Klan or to have a rally tomorrow or they'd be lucky to get two hundred people in every five times as many protesters yeah the problem with\nAids and he's like I said that they are protected they have the Democratic party behind them they've got the meat eating behind them they are powerful elements in Hollywood and then you know they're powerful elements in government the mayor of Berkley Jesse arrogant as a member of some antifa Facebook group well\nLook the mayor of Portland will call the cops down so this is a domestic terrorist group you might say that actually has friends in high places\nWell it really does that mean and Chris Cuomo is it like my idol when it comes to media but he's here's a guy who's got a show on a major media network who has said yes it is okay to let them do that\nAs long as it's going against the people that you just talked about the the the alleged so you know All right or white supremacist or whatever I mean there there really are saying it's not equal when it comes to the law if the lawbreakers are doing something that we agree with\nAnd remember that's what the fascist and they basically said listen the Jews control the economy that Jews have in in in Sydney waited than in city insidious lanes are all elements of government so we have to fight the Jews with with\nWith the kind of weapons that they use against us ultimately when Hitler was talking about the big lie he wasn't saying hey I got a big lie he was accusing the Jews are perpetrating a big lie right\nSo ironically Hitler was the one he was lying he was the one who wanted to take over the economy he was the one in wind or tablets to radical control but he was rejecting those accusations onto the Jews and then using that as a pretext\nAnd take over the economy he was the one in line with ... control but he was rejecting those accusations onto the Jews and then using that as a pretext for his own lawlessness\nAnd are busy or and I appreciate your one last quick question from ... to get death of a nation on DVD is out now I'm ... years here's the thing that I see and and you either right or wrong and you have no problem telling me what I'm wrong\nHitler was charismatic I thought the guy was kind of ugly so I really can't compare him to a really good looking person that's running today that's getting a bunch of press but he was charismatic and able to grab your attention with the way that he spoke we're seeing that with a ... now in Texas a cause you a Cortez now in New York you're seeing it now in Florida with Gillum you've got left\nWing socialist who are admitting that they would like to impeach the president or or abolish ice or open the border or shut down the police I mean this guy will work in Texas has called police the modern day Jim Crow but these people are generally speaking good looking\nCharismatic good speakers look nice on camera\nIs that what we're seeing happen again like we saw with\nA Hitler back in the day Hitler came to prominence because people want to hear him speak\n\nThe power of Hitler in ... was that they were able in a very shrewd way to tap\nInto a ... a vein of frustration and discontent go much of that in Germany came out of World War one the feeling that Germany had been screwed over by the treaty of Versailles and Hitler was able to sort of massage that discontent and they're very\nEmotionally effective and galvanizing way now obviously the situation is different the world is different history doesn't repeat itself\nIdentically by I think it's fair to say that this deep vein them democratic this\nContent over losing the election and they thought they were so close or the sense that they that that sort of thing guys have been tried loose from the leaders of control and they're all like\nMe mad about it and what these guys like Ocasio Cortez doing Beto and so on if they're trying it happened to that name them discontent because they know that that political capital there\nAnd they're also lying to actually see what their ... because the court judge was saying what she believes a O'Rourke is not a Walker's law using what spring Texas together and work across the aisle and I love every body and all four one on one for all but then you look how he votes and he wants to raise taxes regulations that he wants to\nBasically open the border because he feels bad about Mexico somehow so I mean it it it really is a couple of different tactics on how they're doing it\nBut it is grabbed the most charismatic person you can cause you're going to get some votes just because people are are ignorant basically and they'll vote for who they feel like they like\n[noise] yeah the Democratic party has always been sort of been divided into the the wing of the income folks and the ...\nLeaking again the fact that and there's no

that's what I read I mean whatever\nAnd by the way your microphones fine as repressive you're like this during the braces very loud subtle where he doesn't have to hold back here\nUm for me a couple of things I think ... is a good singer or they she's a beautiful woman clearly I'm not as educated on this topic is maybe like her to be but why would you throw away and opportunity like that\nBecause of a guy who of his own volition is out of the league\nPolo and I say in your room or in the NFL now than I Am I used to be a great expert of the ... now now for three years and I will go back and watch unless they all stay in for the national anthem and the NFL starts whining as you're fine but you don't stand there going to do that I'm not going to support them\nBut let me make sure that I have the ... story right he was the starting quarter the quarterback for San Francisco\nTook him to the super bowl the last of the ravens several years ago double threat running in passing the quintessential athlete and it looked like more NFL quarterbacks would be like him because of how successful he was\nThen the defense of started figuring 'em out and it wasn't as effective anymore and instead of getting better he was getting worse and then he ended up being the second string quarterback what's behind Alex Smith\n[noise] ah\nNo I think by that time there are any kind of my way okay and then they had but anyway you have backup ... than when I met who has yeah right\nAll right so um he's he's riding the bench and edited Louis start sitting down for the national anthem once the cameras realized that he started kneeling for the national anthem than some other guy would deal with them than other players are league which started kneeling and when he was asked about it he was wearing it like a Fidel Castro shirt\nAnd a sure was Malcolm X senator or something and he's talking about oppression and he's talking about I mean\nHonestly to me the whole thing is weird man\nBecause he was a guy who had a contract where he was making eleven or twelve million dollars a year now there was and this is not widely reported there was a another year on his contract it was a player option your that would've given him nine to all of a million dollars even though he was just a backup\nHe walked away from that in San Francisco one would assume because he thought that there would be a long term contract and even more money waiting for him elsewhere well guess what crickets happened and he didn't get another offer and then you start hearing that the ravens wanted to talk to him that he started hearing that the Denver Broncos wanted to talk to him and he's complaining the entire time that he's not been blacklisted from the NFL because he's dealing\nWhich didn't happen\nIn fact John Elway said we offered him the opportunity to be here and he said no you didn't want to be here so he could be in the NFL Marianna is not doing the super bowl halftime show because you showing support for him and I guess she thinks that he's been black Walter blacklisted from the NFL because of his kneeling is that why she's doing it\nIt's got to be why right probably but I also think that it has a new into them her connections to Jay Z\nWe'll just have to do with it in a couple of years ago beyond say to the halftime show she's married to him\nRight now is me for the whole ... thing happened and then now since then are you sure yeah I thought Kaepernick already was feeling now blowout and that's not the kneeling part of the bar\nWe might have been nearly but it was so what you're saying he was still in the league right now the league\nYet right I I\nDon't get it honestly don't get it they got this history just hold his true right he turned down an opportunity to be on the Denver Broncos he walked away from his last year was contract for I'm not making it up and I know well\nThen what did she complaining about it was his own dumb decision that that led into this\n... I'm not making it up and I know\nWell then what did she complaining about it was his own dumb decision that that led him to this\nAnd he's still claiming that he's still working out and and I guess ready in famous he wanted him but I don't\nGet that he should try it again Denver offer that nobody has has given me any good information to save the gentle way was lying so it may maybe you take the offer that's on the on the table\nHere so we could really and I'll take calls every on if you can't get through just go to Joe talk show on Twitter as I said I Lived tweet here's this guy Dusten was going to say his name but he has called in a in Kansas City\nWho wrote to be on my Facebook page and there was a snarky middle child when I did and responding fast enough I guess you didn't realize that it was actually working at the time and I couldn't respond to he was crazy negative review of me uh so he's on the line now and look\nI I'll I'll give them credit for actually having a set big enough to call the program Dr let's go man let's mix it up what do you got\nIt is there a you invited me and so here I Am\nI did I invited you because you were ... stupid on my Facebook page alleging that I I was taking too long to answer your your bad review I'm working why would a dining out while when I used to while they stopped working to answer your dumb review why would I Do that\nWhen you stop to work in a long enough to call me clueless\nAnd tell your clue is right it took me so I took me two segments to write clueless but now that you're on the air and fill me in what what is it that I have Ron let's go\nWhat you say you told me that I'm an idiot not clueless and I should call the show and you tell me why\nNo no no I didn't tell you didn't show me where I show me where I called you an idiot and and told you that I Would tell you why you wrote about your guy okay here here's a mix\nUp that style non stop what do you like stop stop\nThis isn't gonna work you can't talk when I talk 'cause nobody can hear you\nHere's the thing I gave an overview to my listeners of what you wrote which was basically I lean Republican my whole life but it's horrible with the Republicans will be gone have become everybody that I Know is going to stop voting Republican and in fact I'm going to do all I can devote them around and there's a I'm going to vote Democrat in this coming election now tell me how someone\nThat's exactly what you said tell me it really isn't\nGoing to put you on hold here here's a way it's going to work Dusten this is a nationally syndicated radio show your heard by about five or six million people right now and so far you sound a little bit on educated\nEven what you you wrote yourself because of how far the Republican Party went away from what you believe in you decided you could never vote Republican again in factory to do what you can devote Democrat that's what you said I said you're clueless if you'd like to correct that I'm listening to your go ahead\nI guess right as I said I said it's because of the the girls the Carter from traditional Republican values there\nIs endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent in the ... movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great\nThough you don't want to pose it Gillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's a tunnel individual capital so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about\nUh we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas that may be a Republican wouldn't 'cause the Democrat even though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really aligned with the radical left which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's ... he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's\nIt's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have done is like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that they that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I mean in Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics in South Florida\nUm and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California um and then of course in central Florida you know we've had a burgeoning population of people who were Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually in ...\nYou know we've had a burgeoning population of people who are Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually endorsed by the sitting congresswoman from Puerto Rico\nOr who's a Republican and a friend of mine and so I think\nThe reason why Florida we're doing good it's because we're producing economic opportunity\nAs Republicans I mean we have the lowest unemployment in the history\nOf our country it's hot and I think we can do even better and Florida you're not going to do that though if you do what Gillum wants to do which has raised taxes forty percent a single payer health care you know on and on and does that would really be the end the Florida it's economic momentum so I think a lot of these folks\nReally across the border looking at it and say you know I Want to be able to have a good job I'm going to be able if I work hard to be able to get ahead well clearly if that's what you're looking to do and I'm your guy because I'm going to build upon that success Florida has has had economically I Am not going to tear it down with can fifth get tore pots policy\nIt's run run as soon as he is a Republican running for governor of the great state of Florida former congressman from down there but let me talk specifically about school school safety you know them a good friend of a republic will course tragically lost his daughter meadow in Parkland, Florida and I missed the high school in February fourteenth that area of the state was put on the international map\nAs ground zero of gun control versus you know armed guards at the schools\nOf you've got people on school boards like this guy Runcie who is a promise program Obama guy who will ignore the the violent criminal history of students just so that they don't have a a record when they get out of school for some reason\nOr what can you do should you become a governor I Hope you will become a governor think you're gonna but what can you do from that offers from a position to stop allowing sheriff like Israel to turn a blind eye to a bad guy who could walk on campus\nAnd kill a bunch of people to get people off school boards like run see who is going to ignore criminal records of people like this Eighteen Nineteen fifty three fifty eight I don't see his name I see his\nHis prison number what can you do from that position and from that offers\nTo shore up our schools and guarantee our kids are gonna come home at the end of the day\nOff you have to weigh Florida works is if you have and if they're so like the Sierra who's elected county wide uh the governor can remove them from office um and I said after Parkland\nAnd after seeing a share of Israel do on on um blame other people in\nPower cow for the cameras not be honest with the people a Broward County I said if I were the ... and I would have removed Israel I think that was appropriate thing to do what I'm In\nThe navy I I'm a former navy by right when the when the ... and ground the top of the ship is held accountable that's just the way it is a Israel was saying hey I gave the guy a badge what am I supposed to do not my problem that's\nNot leadership that passing the buck right and I thought it was disgraceful the way he handled themselves so that is one tool you have but obviously I'm working with and the power as well to make sure that we do what we need to do legislatively I said at the school districts are able to protect their students and\nSome school districts will do a much better job and I think Andy had a lot of problem uh getting the Broward school district is heavily bureaucratic a lot of very left wing ideas\nFor listening to read and he was trying to ... in the school board members so that they couldn't remove Ron ... is on and they they narrowly lost so it's just I was disappointed to see that because I agree with you run sees policies helped facilitate what happened in park like\nIran would you leave it in a guy like ready judge in Polk County to to sort of be a guide to other counties he's doing great work there as far as school safety goes\nAbsolutely I mean we were in ... county couple of days ago grade he endorsed me with a bunch of the others\nIt goes absolutely I ... we were in ... county couple of days ago grade he endorsed me with a bunch of the other share of that that's a huge huge job plus for me in this race that almost a unified support of law enforcement throughout the state of Florida partially because I've been very strong in support of them and have a\nGreat wealth above that go on me usually hospital that amending the law enforcement and they realize that he's dead in her they're going to have a target on their boss is that he will demagogue the police and he will use law enforcement as a political football\nBut I agree with you it's a round as soon as this Republican running for governor the great state of Florida is to Andrew Gillum let me just give you some crickets in about a minute that we have remaining that I really appreciate your time run a taxation it looks like a tax cuts to point over on deck here if the house should go to the Democrats that's not going to happen\nAs the governor of his state would you support the president and continuing to lower our taxes\nAs Floridians where people in the United states\nBam right\n[laughter] so that was that was pretty quick I'm All right a pro life obviously argue for defunding Planned Parenthood even on the state level\nBut yeah so absolutely\nUh when it comes to this caravan of illegal immigrants coming toward border what should we do we can't just keep on giving you know 'cause I Know the government wants to give a path to citizenship for anybody who can sneak across the board or what do you do\nThat will get all he wants to abolish ice and they want and open borders so Dale I'm with say\nThe Caribbean should just be able to go in that foreigners get to determine who comes to our country not read the American people look I think the president\nShould use whatever tools rather disposal I think the Caribbean needs to be turned back we've got to insist on the rule of law you can't have people just charging into the country I'm In the middle of the border and it just doesn't work and\nSo I Know the players getting is monitoring that I think he will take some sort of action uh and I think if we can turn the caravan around I think that that will be a good thing we've got to stop and mad but our southern border\nIf you were the governor he asked you to send National Guard from Florida there to protect our borders ...\nIt would depend on what that means we're like obviously we have a lot of them being a\nHelping with the hurricane right now I'm Still not though this may not be the best time for it but if I had a free or resources that that that had some free time I think it is important because when the drugs come over the border\nYou know that affects Floridians I mean the fence and all these synthetic opioid the big problem in our state and I think that if we're able to turn that back that would be a good thing\nI Know that Andrew Gillum his four equalizing schools and education by by forcing more taxation and more public schools he's against the school vouchers are you for or against vouchers\nOh we have we have a hundred and thirty thousand kids\nMany of them low income on various scholarship program rains you want to end all of it ... for those I think that they're successful\nAnd they're in a variety of different ways whether it's low income whether it's special needs whether we have a scholarship program for kids that are bullied in school so their parents can find a safe environment Andrew would cut the scholarship and force them back into the school where they're being bullied so he is very ideological about that even though these programs that work\nHe would literally pull the rug out from underneath these family\nGive out dream scholarships like this obviously exponentially help lower income people why the left would be against it as much to me Ron I I really appreciate your time and they had busy or the Republican running for governor the great state of uh of Florida it's wrong to see it as just do it again OK\nOkay thank you\nI appreciate you that's a wrong to see it as if you're listening in Florida I Hope you'll

they can't so very thought was let's build freedom for the homebound\nAnd this there are caption on their website says have you ever changed a person's life in a single day\nThe Texas ramp project does it hundreds of times a year what do they do they build real ... wheelchair ramps for disabled or elderly people who can't afford to buy one they say in a few hours on a Saturday morning we give these folks the freedom to leave their home again\nThe home where they want to remain but who steps\nHave imprisoned them so I think as as as silly as maybe some people you know it's just a ramp you know what the heck did can't they go to Home Depot and get some they want you know maybe their budget precludes them from doing it maybe they just don't have the wherewithal and they're dealing with other things physically so these individuals' has stepped up\nAnd stepped out and pony up to the plate\nNow I can say to people who come into our office and they sit across the table from us we run the smart money master plan we analyze their current positions\nWe look at their annuities we look at their insurance as their life insurance their disability their long term care coverages we dissect all of that we put a plan together\nWe show them the power of zero give them the book the power of zero run the trailer the power of gives the movie's not out yet and they think to themselves mark thank you for sharing this with us we don't we want to be ahead of this\nWe don't want to be reacting we want to be proactive so we encourage you give us a call\nYou want to see the movie get on the movie list you want to make an appointment you say mark I can't even wait for the movie I Want to know what I Need to do today I've been listening to the show you've been thrown out a lot of facts and figures and you're saying\nThe financial sue nominee is coming we are spending a trillion more than what the government is taking in\nHow long can this madness last as long as there are people in Congress that's how long it will last\nReally\nAs long as they continue to put at the forefront their own wellbeing\nTheir reelection\nAren't you stress and all the negativity here on the radio the candidates against one another it's cut throat as mean spirited\nIt's just it's the folks who is not about you so what so the purpose of me even saying all this is you need to take your own financial well being into your own hands and you do that by\nGetting the phone in your hand and calling\nOwn financial well being into your own hands and you do that\nBy getting the phone in your hand and calling us at two nine six four four six for\nMaking an appointment folks what we do eventually\nYou buy something there is a product or a concept or a strategy that you say mark that makes sense we need to redeploy dollars we need to reposition dollars we need to start what we call income shifting\nBecause mark we believe now you're right taxes are on sale they are at historically low rates so let's start moving the money now so that down the road to government doesn't Jack\nUp the rates and charges Moore you pick up the phone call she called me on my cell phone you want to argue this point with me I'm happy to do that\nBecause folks the Math Doesn't lie we told you last week in fact you Googled it write us debt clock dot ORG\nTalk about sobering talk about really putting the numbers behind what I'm Talking about here\nA sovereign debt crisis is on the way and the government refuses to do anything about it don't look if you tell me I don't like what the government's doing then don't agree with them and don't apply them by sticking your head in the sand along with them\nPlease don't do that have enough\nGuts to pick up the phone and say more I Want to make a difference in my life and in my family's life tell me what I Need to do this is a business that we are in a business of advice look at where the economy's going look at\nHow they're spending is out of control\nWhat mark what do we do I had this\nConversation last week with a couple who came in\nAnd it was very easy for me to step them through the mental gymnastics of saying look if you were twenty five years old or you're Twenty years old you're probably going to be in a zero percent tax bracket the the lowest bracket you've ever been in and they're probably thinking themselves will Mark I'm not twenty five ... sixty five or Seventy\nBut they know either their grandkids or other kids that are in their twenties what a great message that they can take somebody it's imagine this\nSomebody here's my message they say they pick up the phone and they're calling young people saying I Need to take you out for a cup of coffee because I Want to tell you how you can protect yourself from what's coming so I had this conversation I said imagine they're in their lowest lowest bracket ever is it fair\nFor the government to say we will allow you to postpone the tax that you owe today which is oh by the waves zero and push it out to where you're sixty five or Seventy or Seventy five whatever they end up whatever age they ended up retiring at\nAnd now you're in a forty or fifty percent bracket it just just on the surface Tristan\nIs that fair but you know what people are doing it all the time\nThey are constantly doing it because the message from Wall street the message from our Congress the message from the four oh one K. providers and so on and so forth is\nDiffer differ differ\nBut look you're taking you the listener\nCare old you are you're taking on all the risk by putting money into those qualify plans and kicking it out to a\nHow old you are you're taking on all the risk by putting money into those qualify plans and kicking it out to eat what I can conceive of is going to be a much higher tax bracket\nYou're postponing the inevitable does it make sense to stop the madness today\nAnd put the money someplace where you pay the tax and get it over with and then all the gain all the girls all those accounts were going to earn or going to be yours tax exempt tax free\nSee on the surface that sounds magnificent doesn't it doesn't that sound like a winning game plan a winning scenario to us it does\nBut I have to tell you it most people they hear that message and they continue\nTo max out there are qualified plans are for ... for all three bees they continue just to keep putting more and more money because they like that deduction which you know now listening to the show it's simply a postponement of the inevitable\nThe vehicles that we encourage you to put your money's into by pain that stack city and getting it over with when you go to pull that money out none of that money none of those dollars show up on your ten forty form we think that's pretty magnificent\nNot only does it does not show up on your ten forty foreign but it doesn't affect Social Security a lot of\nPeople come and they say mark this is it fair eighty five percent of my Social Security that I'm receiving each and every month each and every year as being taxed I Know I I go I Know\nHow do we stop the madness\nBy doing something about it today and you can start by making an appointment\nCeiling was always segue to that because that's the important thing to do is to make an appointment look if you haven't done it up to this point on your own then maybe you just have you had to raise your hand and say you know what I Need some help here\nMark you sound like a\nPretty responsible individual and upfront kind of guy you have a good attitude about this you're always so positive yes because as the people at the Texas ramp project are doing they're changing lives and that's what we're doing one life at a time\nIn history since said they're doing that for a hundred and some times a year that's pretty magnificent we think we are as well so give us a call two nine six four four six four we will run for you complementary\nSocial Security maxim position report we will do the smart money master plan or the smart money timeline as it now is evolving into\nWe will do a ten forty review you might be thinking mark\nMan if if what you're saying is true that I'm In the lowest bracket today doesn't make sense for me to start shifting\nSome of those retirement qualified dollars start paying the tax start getting a tax paid for it today and shifting them into vehicles were when I go to pull all that money out I pay zero taxes let's explore that together I Can't make a blanket statement over the airwaves\nI did a couple of months ago and I continue to even in our office and I will do that right now is that what if you could earn an additional thirty to fifty percent on a guaranteed basis in retirement than what you projected what you're on a progression to make right now\nWould that be of interest to you thirty to fifty percent more mark are you kidding me of course I Would call you in a heartbeat okay a heartbeat about five just passed me saying all that are so give me a call [laughter]\nIn a heartbeat okay a heartbeat about five just passed me saying all that are so give me a call to not yet right two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five this is important stuff\nIt's life changing it will change the trajectory of you and your family's life for ever but only if you decide now is the time on the person I Want to make a change I Love my family I Love where you're going with this mark\nAnd if you do then I'm going to encourage you again give us a call set up a time come in and we're not going to bite you gotta leave with all kinds of duties we're going to talk more about long term care life insurance\nAn annuity they\nYou want to make sure you have done the very best job possible when it comes to him\nHappens and you want\nTo make sure you have done the very best job possible when it comes to ensuring your life there are many people will say now mark you look I've heard this ... whole life insurance I shouldn't I I've heard bad things about it I Googled it it says it's a lousy investment it's a horrible well what I say about ten minutes ago was\nLife insurance is not an investment however it has about thirty different benefits in comparison to maybe you're for all and K plan or your IRA or your brokerage account\nWhich doesn't have all those thirty different investment or those thirty different attributes so that's why it's important if what you knew to be true wasn't when what you want to know I Hope you want to know today will\nMark if I come into the office you're just going to try and sell me a whole life insurance no I'm not\nGoing to have a count of conversation about what you currently have in place and if we can put you in a better position if we can re deploy the dollars you're currently spending over here and move them to over here by the way I'm using hand signals writes us from here to here\nAnd it's more efficient for you and your family and you create an additional twenty or twenty five maybe even even thirty different benefits would\nThat be important to you\nWhen I bring people face to face with the amount of benefits a four one K. plan or a four oh three B or an a a a an IRA provide\nThink about it just offhand what you get ready to return you get a postponement slash differ oh\nOkay well let's see what if you become disabled no that plant stops what if you die there's no death benefit so there's there's only limited number of benefits into it with those vehicles now granted\nQualify plans under a risk the guidelines are creditor protected well some of his life insurance always when you stack them up side by side I remember one time since I wrote down the list uh thirty different things\nBut I didn't title it I said would you like all these things in the next thing you purchase of going will absolutely those are those are incredible those are marvelous I said well it's life insurance and they look they ran like screaming down the street\nIt didn't make sense to me it's like you liked all the benefits I just wonder if I call that my favorite thing I call a peanut butter and jelly sandwich would that be more palatable it would be\nBut we have to at the end of the day tell you look this is what it is this is what annuities will do for you let's take longevity risk off the table right now let's stop the madness\nThe man this is going to happen I have an article here and by the way if you'd like a copy of any of this or if you like what we call the optimize or packet\nI'll make sure all these articles are included a this article um whereas I find this New York post it says a next crash will be worse than the great depression\nIsn't that uplifting isn't that how you want to start your weekend Mara great article hey yeah sure yeah next crash will be worse than the great depression yes why because us households debt of Thirteen points three trillion\nI Know a trillion with a T you guessed it last week if you didn't hear last week's show you needed to go listen to trust in hit it out of the part\nThat Thirteen point three trillion now exceeds the two thousand eight Pete that's due in part to mortgage lending which is hovering near its decade ago level of nine trillion plus dollars\nMortgage lending which is hovering near its decade ago level of nine trillion plus dollars\nStudent loans outstanding have sky rocketed think about this from six hundred and eleven billion in two thousand and eight to around one point five trillion\nToday and others yeah trust is like what can we stop the madness are there are people want to say you know what they're going to point those yeah we need to stop demand is we need to give everybody free education\nLike that will happen auto loans at nearly one point two five trillion have exceeded the two thousand and eight total while credit card balances are just as high now is before the great recession\nWhen is the madness going to stop you know what it's going to stop when you pick up the phone\nYou say enough is enough\nMarch I don't wanna fall prey yeah like ... hunker down right treason hunker down I don't want to fall prey to what you're saying is going to happen is going to come and what you say is inevitable\nThe madness the man this isn't going to stop as long as we have a Congress that refuses to look at the national debt as our biggest national security problem\nIt is but you know what it's not politically expedient politically expedient for them\nTo say this why is because it's going to require them to say let's lower the debt ceiling let's increase taxes let's cut some of the benefits that Social Security Medicaid and Medicare or providing\nHow well is that going to sit with their constituency a not very well at all so they refused to do anything other than kicked the can down that proverbial road stick their head in the sand and then say and give us lip service like they're really all about us\nIf you believe that\nThen I'm Sorry that's not what the truth is if what you knew to be true wasn't when when you want to know after today show you should be saying mark now's the time I Need to put a plan together if what you're saying is true how can these insurance companies\n\nHow well they fared during what you're saying is going to be a Great Depression worse than the great depression let me tell you this insurance companies are designed for times like this why\nBecause of what we called actuarial science\nActual real science is absent on Wall street actuarial sciences absent within all your brokerage accounts unless there's some annuities perhaps in those accounts [noise] X. oriole science\nIs not an individual stocks and bonds it just isn't it is\nInherent it's built in to why and what insurance cut why insurance companies do what they do and what they do they deal with the law of large numbers that is why\nYou would be silly to try and go this alone you need a partner with carriers with companies with concepts that are designed for times that we're going through right now out of control\nDomestic spending oh domestic well meanwhile global debt\nResult of central bankers flooding economies with cheap monies to lift them out of a funk is now to [laughter] interest in global did two hundred and forty seven trillion dollar\nOut of a funk is now to [laughter] interest in global debt two hundred and forty seven trillion dollars up from a hundred and Seventy seven trillion Walmart that's only up Seventy trillion remember a little

Bush this was a major issue there would come up in Washington regularly would be the uh the annual deficit and the over all national debt as really being a threat to the U.S economy today the only person that you really here talking about this was Rand Paul\nRand Paul one guy one guy yelling the lone voice in the wilderness saying you better repented this one because at one point there is going to be a time of reckoning\nAnd I said so many different times and we talked to ... Williams lately friend wouldn't talk to him but we've heard from him\nAre saying that this is the primary weapon up the elite to destroy the sovereignty is a different countries and then out of the ashes of destruction they're going to bring about a new one world currency Irwin world or\nA financial system that they will control and again I get criticized because I've I'm pushing that it's going to be crypto currency the reason I like bitcoin is it's decentralized it is the antidote to a centralized currency a Federal Reserve or a central bank throughout the world or in a nation or whatever\nThat's why I really do believe still that is the answer to starve them\nBecause they have already added such crippling debt\nTwo nations around the world we're seeing this in Venezuela is well are there is new a new news coming out of there saying how ah I'll walk in my broken shoes mom daughter leave Venezuela as the night approached\nThey wrapped Hirsch a hurt her daughter and a blanket and prayed for a ride from the frigid Colombian mountain top known as the ice box and they're ... they're leaving there in droves because their currency has gone bust\nNow there's a lot of different factors I Know that there's a lot of different ... isn't just totally socialism there is a ... fight over their oil and a lot there's a lot of different factors but make no mistake about it\nOr what you're seeing there in Venezuela what you're seeing a different what other different parts of the country are also fighting these economic disasters land that you know\nYou know in South America or not everyone is aware of this 'cause\nOther different parts of the country are also fighting these economic disasters lay on the you\nKnow well you know in South America or not everyone is aware of this cause health America and the events happening there politically aren't always really on our radar screen but I Know Brazil is having some serious economic issues Argentina uh is suffering of course Venezuela Colombia\nOr has it issues so I mean South America in general you've got a lot of economic instability going on there and ... and that is one of the reasons why this massive flow of people from Venezuela in the Columbia is really destabilizing Colombia\nOr they can't afford to take in all of these new refugees from Venezuela who have no money or it's causing problems in their country as well that you know that's the ripple effect that happens when you've got a disaster like Venezuela I guess\nIt's just so stable and those prices will just keep going up\nAnd then you'll have more more Wall Street getting\nSenior so stable isn't it it's just so stable and those prices will just keep going up\nAnd then you'll have more more Wall Street getting greedy greedy off of those fees and you slide right down into a collapse scenario\nAnd I dare say when the class it happens again there isn't going to be a bailout it isn't going to be just we're gonna have to solve no they're the they're going to try to solve the housing sector no it will not just stay in the housing sector it will be a complete dollar collapsed everything associates a dollar\nWill be absolutely shut off they'll call it a bank holiday that the the ... oh it's a ... that's that's the words that they use is Gerald ... says it's it's it's a holiday it's not going to be a holiday at all it's going to be we're going to steal your money\nAnd you know that retirement account you had you know that pension you thought you were going to get you know that Social Security [noise]\nNo you're not going to get any of it\nAnd it I I sail is because it's gonna get worse forty percent this ... this I'm not making this up forty percent of American middle class face poverty in retirement study concludes some forty percent of middle class Americans are at risk\nOf poverty in retirement do the depressed earnings an asset valuations and increased health care costs\nAnd I said now or are we in good times with Trump well we're in better times with Trump as far as employment goes\nThere's ... better ways and more ways out there to get employed the problem is the dollar is going down and there's really nothing Trump can do about the dollar yes having\nA better oil production is going to slow that process but it's just like someone you say you have half a million dollars saved it from an individual's perspective you have a half a million dollars in student loan debt which some kids do now have\nYou get a apartment or a house so you're on the hook for that say that's a quarter of a million dollars\nSay you have a ... a car payment and that's a thirty thousand dollar cars so you're looking at a five hundred dollar a month payment there say you have credit card debt\nAnd say and you got to pay health insurance and so you have all these bills and there's nothing Trump or someone else above that individual is going to fix that\nYes they can get a job in a little bit better paying job for now\nOkay that's about as much as he can improve that situation for that individual and maybe a tax cut her too but in the end of the day that debt is probably going to get worse\nAnd that debt is always going to be there so now we're to a catastrophic point for that individual say\nUm say that person can't work anymore or say or some unseen factor\nThat is where we are in it as a nation as a world is there might be unseen factors that could ... the bubble\nSo hopefully that as a way to explain that but\nAs good as what we have it with Trump or it's not going to get fixed like the ... says the damage has already done the bubble is already formed we are in place we just want to get rid of this guy in the White House that might prosecute are correct crimes\nAnd we need our our man or woman\nWe just want to get rid of this guy in the White House that might prosecute are correct crimes\nAnd we need our our man or woman in place in the White House who will pander to us and give us free reign when it actually does happen so we don't go to jail because these guys don't want to go to jail [noise]\nSo hopefully that explains it in a little bit better term interview we also saw this last week or we're seeing this week here in California this ... Harris of California wants to give families six thousand dollars a year in New legislation is basically universal income\nSo of course Democrats than or stupid enough to think wow we're really going to benefit from this you're not going to benefit from it because all that's going to happen is prices are going to go up\nYou know and you see that in Venezuela a as an example of this is that uh the government raised the minimum wage and and you read it just recently is that the government of ...\nKeeps raising the minimum wage minimum wage minimum wage is higher or you can multiply at ten times if you want to but the price is when you have hyperinflation of a million percent a year who\nCares what the minimum wage is there's nothing that you're going to do to be able to close that gap between what I'm getting and what it's worth to buy stuff with you see\nAnd so this is this is the same thing that's happening here you know when you talk about people who are looking at poverty in retirement I Wonder you know among our listeners how many people are looking ahead to retirement\nAnd uh I'm at an age where I think about that also how if you really are going to stop working\nBecome fully retired and not have a job not be working part time and I think a lot of Americans reaching retirement age we're planning on working at least part time to keep going [noise]\nBut if you were to retire completely ... many of us are ready to live on Social Security and our IRAs mhm I don't think there's that many in that category they would feel yeah I could live comfortably without an income after I turned sixty five\nThose numbers are clearly gonna ... I'm sure there is a percentage out that they can but I'm sure those numbers are dwindling to where people are like no I'm not really this is not this is I got to keep working in some capacity to keep things afloat and uh I\nI I I I daresay again a universal income will not work\nI was with someone just yesterday he he he was we were filming a scene he was an actor from LA and he also works as an electrician and I was driving him around I took him back to the airport here and he looked at our gas prices like oh my gosh two fifty a gallon for unleaded\nYeah and like yeah that's that's actually kind of high for us we've been we've been lower than that even recently he was like wow 'cause I was just in California this last weekend it was over four dollars a gallon that's what he's reacting to and I said yeah even yeah especially here in Tucson you can get a\nA you can get a nice house for a quarter of a million two hundred fifty thousand he wore how a nice house yeah cause that nice house in California is going to be over half a million\nAnd so ... and he's like oh my goodness and he's like but the ... and the reason he worked in California area is not just for his acting and it was for more for his electorate is part of the uh a union for electrical workers\nAnd with that they get you more income and he's like I got drawn in by the income but then when he and the other day you're actually taking less money home\nMore income and he's like I got drawn in by the income but then when he and the other day you're actually taking less money home any comments about this less money home because the the price of living is so much the cost of living is so much more\nAnd that is the result of direct liberal Democrats policies is oh we're going to give you this we're going to give you that it's going to be so much better yeah but you're not taking into account\nThe expenses that are going to be so much worse in the place that you're giving me the all this free money\nAnd I dare say that there's going to be more results of that as we see a\nThe the liberal policies that that they're bringing out in this uh mid term election\nUh I I guess it and you see this with our costs yeah Cortez and you see this with Bernie Sanders we're going to give you free free free free free\nThe liberals are going to find out the hard way the left wing is going to find out the hard way that there is no such thing as free and it's going to become glaring uh parents and we're looking at the Democrats right now we're going to talk about this on the second half of the hour\nThe Democrats are looking forward to winning the house and with winning I think they're going to have to deploy a bigger strategy than just we got to get to Trump\nCars so far in the last two years that has not been working and what are we going to be the bigger obstructionist now they're going to have to come up with some sort of policy and all those policies are going to be very [noise]\nSocialistic in nature and their two Americans have have we we live we actually live in a country full of socialism and it hasn't worked and of course the the left blames capitalism\nBut as we go more socialism is are the people going to be awake to the ruling elite that has actually do them into it because you're going to have to give up more rights you're going to have to give more taxes\nTo get what you think is free or we're going to talk about a lot more this on the other side of the [noise] we we're approaching that first break I Would encourage everyone to go to my YouTube channel conspiracy facts conspiracy fact on YouTube and you can go on there you can share the show you can email me\nAnd to get involved in the info war because that is what it's all about on the other side of the break we're going to be talking about the new in mortality\nOr that the aluminum ideas bragging as well as super humans we're going to be talking about we're definitely got to talk about the midterms there's so much news talk about there did you hear about the New Mind controlling drones and the Vietnam cyber laws\nThis ... Seattle facade yeah very good and there's one there's two things I really cannot stand when it comes to people okay the number one thing that I Can't stand about people is that when\nYou're wrong and your emotional about your opinion okay I cannot stand that makes me so angry is when you're emotional about something and then you turn out to be wrong and you keep talking\nHere she was emotional about her opinion she was forced certain that she was right she turns out to be a wrong and then she still thinks that her opinion matters I cannot stand that I absolutely cannot stand that I understand you can have an opinion I understand he can be emotional and I understand you can\nAbout opinion but when you're driving\nUnique to shot up\nThat is one thing that really makes me upset the other thing that makes me upset really ... well actually before we get into the second thing I Want to move over to Dr Ford you know the woman who was accusing a judge Kevin yeah doctor who who was that again yeah oh all of a sudden all of a sudden\nShe's gone\nSee here's the thing Democrats were super emotional about oh she's been molested oh she's been raped thirty some years ago oh she's so it it's it's a tragedy oh she couldn't get over it for the last Thirty years I guess what that night she probably went to Taco Bell right afterwards she was over it real quick\n'cause she was so drunk she probably doesn't really remember it and to never happened\nSay there's no evidence there is no witnesses I'll tell you why there's no evidence no witnesses it never happened and detective and that the FBI who was probably called into this investigation saw this and they're like uh there's not one gram of evidence that supports\nDetective and the FBI who is probably called into this investigation saw this and they're like uh there's not one gram of evidence that supports anything that this woman saying and there's no eyewitnesses they're saying it and even if there was where's the police report for thirty some years ago\nSomething when ... when there is a crime there is a result of that crime somewhere that can be seen\nAnd sense that didn't happen nothing really happened of it but here's again Democrats were so emotional about that crime that they put their their their weight into it\nAnd now that they've been proven wrong and there's no political points to be gained at this point by stretching it out\nIt's gone it's just like the Russian collusion not one gram of evidence we were super emotional about the country's been sold out to Russia oh Trump is so Russian him and who are in bed together and they go on and on there so emotional about it but when there's really\n... that's the ... turns a absolutely nothing and Miller and all the rest of them are looked like a bunch of stupid fools\nFits gone there were so emotional about it thinking that this was that this was it we're going to we have them so far it's gone\nWhere separating children at the border there separating children from their families their parents are the children are so separated once once Trump calls an end to it actually that it's then it goes on line and all the ... show that George W. Bush was doing it\nBut a bronco Bible was definitely doing it\nIf it's gone no political points to be one with it and now you have this new caravan of people coming in and now you have proof that you have a bunch of children who are faking it that are not with their actual parents if you don't hear anything about it that's because they're emotional\nDemocrats are overly emotional that's why they should never be voted into power right now even the ones who declared themselves independent I daresay both issues are just gone because they're overly emotional\nAnd there and so many times they're wrong\nYeah and you know I think part of that uh you're right a certainly and I think part of that is because of their whole standard it seems their whole reason for existence on the left and ... which means most of the Democrats at this point in time is simply to be the anti Trump\nOr we everything they seem to want to discuss and get into is based upon\nHow can we be anti Trump in our position on this whether it be with migrants coming across the border illegally or whether it is with Trump's a nomination of Kevin Oh how can we make sure that we are diametrically opposed to anything\nThat Trump wants or decides or says well that is going to put you on the wrong side of things an awful lot and you're going to look like someone that is only trying to a poll lose someone rather than setting forth an agenda can anyone really give me any kind of a reasonable list of what the democratic\nAgenda yeah well the agenda is steal from the middle class and give it to everybody else and\nThat's not going to work ... again ... ... it makes them that's it it's the target and the punch bowl\nThe Democrats are uttered gun control it's a target and the punch bowl immigration illegal immigration target in the punch bowl and that's what they're going into in this mid term why are they gaining all this money why that because so many of them are by hurts and when your butt hurt you\nThey are going into in this mid term why are they gaining all this money why that because so many of 'em are by hurts and when your butt hurt you are motivated to do something and they're and they're complaining and they're whining and they get a bunch of illegal immigrants to the right now they're trying to get a illegal immigrants to vote\nWhich brings me to this we gotta talk about this ... guy\nThis bait to guy from Texas ... at this point what we're looking at here in this midterm election is very very important to the left wing party they have got to have made to win that's why they want the illegals to vote in Texas is ... does not win ladies and gentlemen\nUh they're stuck with all with what we can see now with what we can see now\nJoe Biden is going to be the candidate for twenty twenty creepy Joe creepy Joe pedophile Joe is going to be the ... going to be ... and he's not going to it's not going to work he used to associate with establishment people know him that he has pedophilia\nUh friends and he is one and three he's an old white dude\nThe when it comes to the left wing politics they need someone to worship\nThey worship the government they need that it is their God they worship their political guide like Brock Obama doesn't matter what he does he's or God and we feel that he will get us our welfare\nAnd he'll steal from everybody else to give to us we totally one hundred percent believe that it didn't happen but still they were they still worship and he's black he's got a Muslim name he was young at the time now he's old now he's used trash\nAnd they need that again and they do is that guy comes in on the rallies on a skateboard he supposedly a musician and he promises some socialism and he's he is a white guy but he he's got the Mexican name so we can associate him with Hispanics that's worship all\nOkay we've got to have that guy because Hillary Clinton ain't going to be at okay Elizabeth Warren is not going to be at Bernie Sanders is in a white guy\nWe don't like old white guys we like young worship ... worship will both be people here on the left not old white men we need young guys we need young women we need Muslims we need blacks Hispanics or anything but a white man\nAnd we need a white or at least a white man with a ... a Hispanic name because the there's a lot of bigotry on the left [noise]\nOkay so do you see the problem there is no one left ladies and gentlemen we are six months away from building the field for twenty twenty for the Democratic primaries the field is the the magical person isn't just going to show up\nThere at the last second is I don't think so\nYes you have a show about what she says it's just been a first lady she hasn't had a political office no business is nothing I I don't think the left is going to give her the reins okay even though she's somewhat popular but her husband didn't do anything\nOr there could be a billionaire that does show up from the left wing at the last minute early six months from now yes it could be it could be an Oprah Winfrey but\nHere's the problem that the left wing has going into the twenty twenty election as Trump is so popular\nOkay you have a unified right wing party now that was not true in two thousand sixteen to succeed that was not unified there was never never Trump movement that did not start from the left it started from the right\nSir from the Ted Cruz people surf from the Marco Rubio people which was Fox\nThat did not start from the left it started from the right\nSurf from the Ted Cruz staple surf from the Marco Rubio people which was Fox News as well as Jeb Bush Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio was the front front runners there from the traditional conservative dates\nAnd then Trump and Trump came out of that Ron Paul base came out as a libertarian base any overwhelm them and the debates and he overwhelm them with excitement and returning to true conservative values and not\nA bowing down to the left and not compromising the country to the left that's what conservatives wanted and now you have these conservative judges they're being appointed by Donald Trump\nThat is bringing these um\nThese never ... on
