what he's gotten accomplishing in Nineteen months if we had a press that had a shred of objectivity left\nDonald Trump would be a sixty five percent approval economy booming unemployment record lows

accountable\nWith these tariffs which has to keep happening he's making NATO nations pay more of their fair share of military he's deregulating where that needs to be done he push a push forward with the Keystone Pipeline and got rid of a lot of those regulations on Keystone Pipeline\nAnd it goes on and on and on and he hasn't built all well that's because Congress won't allocate the money so he

still going on as a matter of fact\nWhich is just fantastic they are so anyway back to this\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh said he was deeply troubled by what has what has been a blatant miscarriage ... mischaracterization buy bread himself of his drinking at Yale Chad loving and now teaches at NC\nState\nSaid he was a friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale and Yale I'm an at Yale Kevin I was a frequent drinker and a heavy drinker on many occasions I heard Brett slur words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption not\nAll of which was beer one Brett got drunk he was often belligerent aggressive\nWhile saying that youthful drinking should not condemn a person for life flooding and said he was concerned about having a statements under oath\nHe said I have direct and repeated knowledge about his drinking and his disposition while drunk and I do believe that Brett's ... actions as a fifty throat uh fifty three year old judge matter if he lied about his past actions on national television and more especially well speaking under oath\nI Believe those lie should have consequences so he's he's both he he's both a judge and the jury here so this uh this classmate flooding to in a as a do we know is\nIs politics is he a Democrat he's a Democrat and\nThe New York times has reported that he has given small donations to Democrat came out so it was a

to say and say that though that you're right a ... ah just had pinned lines\nThoughts and prayers old enough senator he just had these added into the vein sticking out who's never her and I don't know what was going on\nBut I listen to what he said he said you'll notice he didn't say this you'll notice he didn't say that you'll notice he didn't review he wants to raise your taxes and regulations and some kind of Medicare for all that we can afford it wasn't even close do you agree with me that\nThe rubber for instance a work will find any reason not to the beach to groups\nHe was way out of his leg and it was very obvious and look pickers with the national debating championship hair and his his career before he was more than it was ... was um it was a\nLarge argue that sort of the Supreme Court I sent me for that word out and not even a lawyer I couldn't remember argue about wedding aid or whatever right but\nIn court I accept me I've tried to argue and debate with Ted Cruz it if you do not when I'm Out in January and it can sit around that chess game very well so bitter work me to say I was in the room that night and he looked in our but his visit when our back when he was way out of his ... that was not successor hand\nBut more importantly than even stylistically is that better works\nPositions are so far left where the state is to go to our that that debate was really important that he had to get out he had to be put in and it's been a critic was very effective and getting him to come out and talk about the second amendment and how he\nWants to ban gotten judging the about taking down border security taking down in a while now having course ... a ... a policy I raising taxes so taxes are starting to see who\nHe is and it's not just willy Nelson concert in ...

happening\nNow he wants to see you want to he had this big concert with them because they have a lot in common and he wanted that to carry them through the weekend that it does he doesn't want to come talk to to take about to Chris and debating why he is so anti Israel and all these things that are really that Texans don't like\nWell you know if I if I Want to win an election among solar willy Nelson used all ask them to get the help me out but I ... what do I know I'm not I'm not rubber for instance a work of art at you\nWhen you and I don't vote because of celebrities meal for policies that he's he's banking on people voting for him because he's super cool\nYeah well ... either going to call to me to be honest with you to Emily Miller she is a with Ted Cruz that or Ted Cruz that or Ted Cruz that ordered what's interesting about this is it really is a very similar candidacy to what we saw with a Wendy Davis\nAnd our great governor a little while ago um earlier today or it might be ... yesterday it was today a great guy that was on Fox or something and he said\nWe had the same sort of a cult of celebrity um with Wendy Davis where we had floods of money millions and millions and millions of dollars coming into Texas you losing by twenty two points or something I think that's what we're going to see with with rubber phrases overboard\nBut um you and I both went to that

call the appropriation but there are signs everywhere and bumper stickers are more that said BET oh don't seize lush they don't choose first name which is rubbery outside and there are people who truly believe that his mother is a huge Hispanic he's on his manager at all the older you spotted running\nIn this region that matters you identity politics don't matter to me is Ted Cruz she'll how did you overcome that you saw the same comments I did people believe this guy who's like from Mexico\nWell it's going to be fairly simple when they get to the voting booth and one name is Chris my name is ... I'm all the beta science can't you can't put that aside that voting for so there's that and I I I think like you said I don't most people I don't think are going to vote based on the fact that he has Hispanic they're going to vote on his politics and if\nYou are in this day and there are a lot of liberals I'm there and very active\nThis year we've seen the voter rolls in Texas go through the roof they are really angry about the president and so they want someone who is going to support abortion rights and get abortion up more there and find someone who is going to ban air Fifteen they're caught him because he caused some genes of war that little orange holes on the size of oranges\nComputers you know and if you go to fires would instead their weight on what\nI Know I had to say feeling like I\nMean the around us you know this I don't know how an orange to come on the other side right that'd be ... and\n... why why is that while you have around sitting on the table in front of us another question for another now at the end of the older ones that actually wound up\nThose those are college pen very good I don't have a ... but I Do have a carry permit\nAbsolutely that this is a very pro second I'm Out in that campaign\nIncluding for the second amendment but he but he's really not I mean he's as you said these are the left of Elizabeth Warren\nBuffet in the last debate when he said I'm pro second him and for the second and that\nPeople in the audience laughed and laughed because they thought it was almost a joke because like in what way he wants to have he wants to ban ... teens he wants to have political universal background checks means someone on our farm wants to give their\nRifle to their son and I was at the balance city I mean there's so many things that he hasn't done that are so anti tax and values in exile Texans live their lives\nUm and about not about freedom so you know he's he's very charming I don't take that ...\nIt was\nReally really would like to get out out like I Wish there was at a theory is a very important investigation on a summer quarter ... where would that kitchen why would they do it in there what happened to that very fancy kitchen when he's not in it\nWith another case which I'm at the kitchen might have been in Hollywood and we we have no idea where the kitchen was I mean obviously it was a big production already ...
