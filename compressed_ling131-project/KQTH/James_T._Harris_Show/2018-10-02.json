trade only that the United states and Mexico Canada of agreement I guess you would have been called people's\nUh again this is from Fox News President Trump on Monday announced a hard fought trade pact with Canada and Mexico metro place North American free trade agreement\nSaying the deal would bring a new dawn for American auto workers as they truly extraordinary agreement for the United states Canada and Mexico Trump send the rose garden surrounded by his trade negotiating team from spoke after it emerged that Canada and Mexico had agreed to a packed the administration is dubbed the United states and Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nBefore the U.S MCAT implemented though must be approved by Congress will Trump confident and chances are he has his bed there were concerns with the gridlock on Capitol Hill anything you submit to Congress will be trouble he said\nIn a joint statement us trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian foreign affairs minister Christie a freelance so the agreement will strengthen the middle class and create good paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half a billion people who call North America home\nA candidate was brought back into the fold after weeks of negotiations with the deal announced shortly before midnight deadline for both heralded the agreement and he's here he's a Monday morning tweets\nAnd as a great deal for all three countries sold the many deficiencies and mistakes NAFTA greatly opens markets door farmers and manufacturers reduces trade barriers to the U.S it'll bring all three great nations

was the worst trade deal the U.S maybe ever made Trump's and the the\nAnd Trump is regularly blasted napkins disastrous for the economy\nAnd long contending that that was the worst trade deal the U.S maybe ever made from sending the eat some lawmakers immediately express relief candidate had been reinstated in regional trading bloc I'm pleased that the Trump Administration was able to strike a deal to modernize now that we both Mexico and Canada and Senate Finance chairman Orrin Hatch\nNAFTA is a proven success Democrats who are skeptical however any trade agreement muzzle must be judged by whether improves the wages working conditions in well being an American workers and farmers House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said misstatement Democrats are closely scrutinize the text and the Trump administration's NAFTA proposal\nAnd look forward to further analysis in conversations with stakeholders\nAnd the agreement reached Sunday gives us farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market and they keep the ... the resolution process the last one in ... offers candidate protection in terms of goes ahead with plans to impose tariffs on cars trucks an auto parts imported into the United states\nNancy Pelosi\nIt's so weird\nAnd I guess it shows my naivete that I always am surprised but when you're below sea and I'm Wasserman Schultz when they complained\nAbout how little a thousand dollars was that told us a lot about Democrats and how rich these people must be\nBecause it's that can be Thirty years wouldn't make it a pretty good book now a thousand dollars is still a lot of money to me thirty thousand dollars a pretty good bucks right now yes absolutely oh you're making a lot more than I Am so maybe it doesn't you know that you know I Wish it would you ever called the crumbs no no no and\nSo I mean to me it just doesn't make any sense first they say that thousand dollars is crumbs no big deal or what they want to raise taxes again to get the crumbs vacuum it's nothing but that's what they want us to believe that so what people are going back to work that doesn't really prove anything\nAnd now they're going to closely scrutinize this trade agreement a trade agreement that is overwhelmingly good for America American workers\nRemember the dairy farmers in this country did not have access to Canada why there was a two hundred Seventy percent tariff on dairy products from here\nTo there\nJust needs to close these unhappy that farmers will be able to to sell their their goods to Canada and not be taxed like that\nIt really does I mean he's chosen I even is in ... in me that I keep on thinking that they can't possibly say something that dumb\nYou know you're unhappy the jobs are coming back you're unhappy the corporations are paying lower taxes that they can hire more people you're unhappy that some of those people three to four million of them got a bonus or increasing their pay or both\n\nI get you're supposed to complain about the other side and pretend like the other side somehow is evil evil and your some how good\nAre you on the side effects of the family but the but\nThe bottom line is sometimes you just say you know what\nIt's a good thing for American workers you know what I'm Glad the jobs coming back you know what I'm Glad black people\nAre are seeing the lowest unemployment rate they've ever seen in their history and ... and Hispanics and women are going back to work in record numbers you know what those are good things that like it because there is that the other but why complain about things that are universally good I've never understood that the Democrats are going to closely scrutinize\n\nNew packed with Mexico and Canada\nThe Democrats are going to closely scrutinize this new packed with Mexico and Canada I think maybe you blows you should closely scrutinize harass\nSure anything on the no wings that do have now you have no comment on it or not\nPlease don't say past what it's all about somebody's rear and let me go to the phone lines years below welcome to Rudy line one Rudy what's going on\nHey Joe what's going on limited remain let's go\nHey I I'm Glad you are you said that story and your comment about you know the order they're mad about they're mad about Trump winning that's what they're mad about it must be you know you know a wreck Obama was like oh hey you know by the way those jobs are gone a favor by you know moving to something else\nDonald Trump came up and said oh hold on hold my Diet Coke\nWhen people call for war for that to be like well wait a minute this is us these are our brothers these are our sisters are kids who are dying let's make that a last resort instead of a first priority\nThis is us these are our brothers these are our sisters your kid or dying let's make that a last resort instead of a first priority\nIt's Michael Malice author of dear reader the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il make sure you're going get it another thing that didn't really make much news and it should have been headlines for a week is that in fact the president's negotiation did get some remains back\nOver at all and soldiers and again the left on not just the left the\nCorporate media as you say I call it the legacy media they purposely ignored this because they're afraid it'll be a win for Trump when when do you think if ever they'll stop you know counting pluses and minuses W's and an L. as in regard to Trump and actually just look at the the big picture and say this is actually a pretty good thing\nThere's never a W that technology feeds any Trump and the reason I always say corporate press is when you say corporate press it points out the hypocrisy of many and the left because you you and I remember not that long ago\nWhenever you talk to the left is the first Dylan is the corporation or ... it's always a corporation right it was never clear who they met who these corporations are\nBut now somehow when it comes to press which are giant corporation they completely become Mitt Romney conservative right at corporations are people to ... mind boggling so I always use that phrase so it can kind of trigger something and they did get through some of the smarter ones that this isn't exactly who you're his purported to hate\nBut they also have Citizens United and they've got no less than three political action committees spending millions and millions of dollars trying to stop cabinet and you don't get into that the second that we have if we have a moment it's Michael Malice go and get his book the arena the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il art so he's you stop the nuclear testing\nArea hasn't done any in a long time he's sent back some remains were falling soldiers something that we couldn't get done for sixty years old and he's still go shooting possibly demilitarized in the DMZ with South Korea\nUm what has he done I mean what what can the corporate media the largest the media of the left in this country what can they point to as a failure here I mean 'cause it's activists in it I mean you don't just undo sixty years overnight to you\nWell I I mean there's a lot more for him to do I mean we have concentration camps that is the big one to do and I think if that happens if we had the closer the concentration camps then it's going to be a very very hard to well then it wouldn't be Trump's responsibility it would because the moon\nJail I don't even care you know what I mean if we're talking about liberating hundred thousand people who are eight prisoners and Trump doesn't get credit that's the last ...\nSanctioned in a bad enough in is the relationship with us important enough to him to do that will he left these two hundred thousand people go\nWell the problem is when you let them go and you take the gun away from the hostages head then your hold on power because ...\nNow it's kind of very hard for him to liberate because then he is going to be on trial and he's going to have a lot and his sister and all of those other dogs in this you know your accuracy are going to have a lot to answer for for the population so it's a tricky position for him even if he had\nLike some kind of weird epiphany and the best of intentions or you know they had back would be in that case just like Saddam would be up against the law\nThat his objective right now Michael only to survive in power\nWe don't know it really ... and he's clearly making all the right side you talk to the moon is Hassan pale in his talks with President Trump he's not the same person his father who was very much a function of the Cold War I it's so so there is hope there\nAt the same time you know he had been raised for this and he was a kid and he had that whole establishing behind him pushing him to hold the course so we don't know what this man is thinking and he's a very young person is that also kind of add that to the calculus\nIs Michael ... author of dear reader the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il also my favorite an artist so so let's talk about Kevin a little bit about Emma Goldman well your your your top ... for me watching the cabin on your income and watching the

show you the crime yeah uh I mean this is a ... I don't know what I Hope is that conservative start to realize that for the ... is a jihad\nI mean there will take out whatever they need to do a and and the thing is I I I Can't ... they're part of me that the cabinet a little bit because she was there at tennis stars right hand and he saw first hand\nHow Ken Starr everyday Joe literally every day you remember that you're old enough to remember every day Ken Starr is a puritan can sides of sets the sex Ken Starr is a you know it has all these sexual hang up that's why he's doing his job and Ken Starr who was a dignified man\nWho had a dream of being a Supreme Court captive now shut because he felt they will be inappropriate for independent counsel to respond to these literally daily attacks\nRight from it and all his thugs so Kevin I saw this happening it's happening to him to and I'll just say one more thing to the conservative listeners sure\nIf this is what can happen to Brett Kavanaugh this Catholic\nFamily man can be made into\nOvernight it's gone from gang rape is alcoholic right just based on nothing right I just think for a second I read this book by jumping height and he made the joke about if a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged a liberal or conservative who have been arrested\nAnd naturally will happen to you in many circumstances if you're an innocent person and you get the wrong side of the government if this is what can happen to Kevin I think what happens to average citizens a daily basis so people should keep that in mind the southern of course it's just so transparent ... it's just ridiculous\nBut we should be scared to death I mean obviously Dr ... something happened to her but there's absolutely zero evidence that it that he was involved or that it was anywhere near where she thinks it might have been and and the whole I'm afraid to fly was alive she's not afraid to fly the whole you won't come to me yesterday would be the whole that whole thing already his own investigative all I I\nDon't know how you invested in we don't know who what where when just that she kind of says it or this latest person who's the w._b. eleven oddly shows up ... of sweat Nick\nIt turns out everybody who's ever known forever says nothing like this ever happened so at the end of the day what you just said is probably the best thing I've heard not in the in the best good way to best commentary um in that it's jihad\nJihadism good but but you're right this is like to the death for them they're not going to stop is this guy is just gonna ... gonna ever find themselves on the Supreme Court when you know you've got a a flaky guy like this Jeff Flake guardian and maybe showing the Susan Collins might or might not maybe Murkowski might or might not I mean he's doomed visiting I mean I'll be on there but I think he's doomed\nMy hope is that Alexander Hamilton said the best thing about the British Government is the corruption and my hope and as a I'm a huge fan is that Jeff Flake is corrupt and he wants to make that lobbyist money when he retires and he knows that the lobbyists you better not burned those bridges the Republican so that they take us calls\nDid you end up being up those tunes the next day hey anybody want to meet me on an elevator he was making a joke out of it the guy that whole thing happened to be set up no\nI agree that it was set up but the question is how venal is this man to and from everything I've seen he seemed to be no that they get which is hopeful that he is going to hold out for the big bucks and a despite himself a vote to confirm Kavanaugh\nThe whole thing is so screw you you and I can talk about this with an eight hour\n... can I just don't believe in God I I think honestly that day with the testimony\nThe whole thing is so screw you you and I can talk about this\nWith an eight hour ... can I think that I I think honestly that day with the testimony with the craziest day I'd ever seen in politics in my lifetime\nAnd Trump wasn't even in the run on the edge it [laughter] oh God\nYeah yeah but he's in all their heads though Michael you know that he's he's living in a rent free in there\nYeah it was amazing to me like trust that even here and watching them they ran the hall people out of nowhere and Batman added you know fighting the it was it not that it\nWas not only madam is it it it was almost as if it wasn't really happening it ... it was kind of surreal because as\nHe's sitting there and it sort of a cabinet as easing the reacting to it you got on one side of him the lawyers for the person is accusing which was completely unfair there even there and then bumping up behind him is illicit mulatto I'm thinking what am I watching here what exactly is happening in my ...\nJoe you were thinking who's the boss\n[laughter] or clearly it wasn't her that at that moment alright ...

admitted it the other day they don't know we're certainly a liberal place but we wanna we wanna show inequality in a balance in the ... but you but you're not\nWhen people there's another person that that somebody tweeted me that um I guess Donald Trump junior that he's more worried about his sons and his daughters yeah from Kavanaugh thing\nAnd I hope that you get some help but I Hope they find a guy who did it but the allegations against him specifically are not credible so people that are saying that they are\nThey're they're speaking at a school the the next delegation about or that Deborah Ramirez brought up that is not credible either she's actually reporting what she was told people told her thirty five years ago\nAnd the third one completely not credible vis a drill your is a Julie sweating it yes she's the one that says they were trains there were raped trains or something and um\nIt turns out I guess in the year two thousand carrying and maybe you've heard this maybe you didn't but she brought sexual or accusations against somebody else in memory and completely out of line so she's got a history of making this sort of allegation and and it not really having happened and\nAnd now as you said there's an anonymous what did I say oh you weren't here friday when I said was when flakes lake doubt I said\nMark my words there will be more allegations now yeah and even that night you had an allegation from the daily mail that somebody who went to Yale with him said that he drank too much into a drink all the time he was lying that he didn't drink as much\nNow there's some other guy who's a professor in North Carolina says oh yeah those are the basketball team of red blood record really drink really drank a lot and now you've got somebody you say there's an anonymous versus saying that he actually raped\nHer yeah okay this is exactly as are pretty good this is one of the people watching listen to the show because you're going to get a a a silly parity\nWe're gonna talk about body functions you'll have chocolate voice over here you got taco over there\nYou got what's your nose or from the phones and then you got you got me bring you the goods I don't think these protections because I feel like it I didn't want them to be ... but it was clear to me that once the left got what he wanted which wasn't an investigation that's what happened today in Washington DC or carry and Brett Kavanaugh wasn't involved with that\nLeft got what he wanted which wasn't an investigation that's what happened today in Washington DC or carry and Brett Kavanaugh wasn't involved\nWith that first day of the Supreme Court that around eight eight justices\nOnly eight justices yep a bread Kevin I'm should be on there he's supremely qualified um these allegations are easily refuted but now you got to make a misdemeanor guy and let me tell you something they're hanging there having the fact that he showed up angry the other day\nIf somebody accused your brother or your husband to these things wouldn't they be this angry\nFrom yes of course\nSo the idea that he raised his voice and get angry because his poor family is being put through the ringer that to me it would have been ridiculous had he not been angry visibility does if he's not a grassy not even an angry somebody turned me would I be angry but he shows up angry said look how injury is probably drunk probably drink some beer before he came in today\nThis is what it turns into so I made the British and last week absolutely right\nI definitely want your suggestions on parity at Joe talk show for Jeff Flake or come and see if we can get a gold for tomorrow meantime back to the phone lines when you see a little welcome to line two is going to be a Tucson, Arizona and ... what's going on\nNow I'm I'm curious about what they are so much for on it that far more power to pay a little hard not to eat or about what we'll all go up\nOur own board it paid and stuff like that I think that they don't want to open borders I Want my bloody while I'm On I think that the part of an idea and I find that I don't think they're credible at all\nI Know you went ahead and covered quite a few times she said she was one or bloody ball is that some of the things you know\nWhat does that mean they don't know what that means and\nWhat I Want my buddy ball and I'd met his own radio news or English term ...\nReasonable enough melt we appreciate your um your your phone was great but um yeah carrier where the entire story of what we know about the deal so far I'm guessing carrying the coming days when you get more details no\nI Would imagine yeah and that would make sense what ... what will come out Paul is in Montana Paul talk to her brother what's going on\nA a ... or ... how you doing I'm\nDoing great man living the dream what's happening\nOr listen you know I tell you something this I have to tell you about this uh about our a hearing a judge Kavanaugh\nA frankly I have never said this out loud but I I Am really a ... disappointed in the end of the Democrats are of a role at all of this ... that there is it's absolutely shameful I think you know and\nAh because I I look at this person or a judge Kavanaugh I've seen on television he looks a like a square a nice\nA family man kind of fellow and his wife is you know they they hit his wife and his children look look like a like a you know like a a a a ... a Norman Rockwell\nPainting you know what I mean yes and it's really ... I'm really ashamed of a form of\nA a and the attitudes especially you know a Dianne Feinstein and and you know I got to tell you something I don't think that she is a true Democrat even\nDianne Feinstein and you know I got to tell you something I don't think that she's a true Democrat even ... she is\nLeading into socialism or leaning into something that's not a familiar door a nor a righteous you know\nOf all I hear you but I also think that you're the guy couldn't explain why you were progressive right\nWell I well yeah you're right\nWell why don't why don't you come to the dark side used to make your conservative American you've been traditional American values what's wrong with that\nWell nothing at all actually and and actually I have made that joke in the past I have a friend here in town he owns a little a tobacco shop very conservative Republican voted for Donald Trump I make a joke with some times about\nAbout my watching Fox Network or Newsmax or a outright\nLike that for instance and I make the joke that I like to go into the twilight zone you know\nOne of the aisles it's widely zone is where you live when you can explain what while you're a progressive vest the twilight zone moment\nThat you may be right about that you may very well be right about that and the reason I maybe I maybe this might explain that this might explain it my parents my father and my mother both are were are a very conservative Republicans\nGuy you know they voted for Eisenhower you know\nA ... and in fact my grandfather my mother's father even vote when he became a citizen in Nineteen fifty five or Nineteen fifty four when he came here uh when he became a citizen he actually did vote for Dwight Eisenhower\nWell what happened to you what happened to me was uh I\nDidn't particularly like they're wanting to vote for Richard Nixon twice because I wasn't uh I see I I Am a Vietnam Era\nVeteran yeah uh I did not go to Vietnam right by a enlisted in the air force in August is sixty nine\nOr ... if you're if you're a Blumenthal you would say the un though but go ahead\nYeah uh well I'm not Blumenthal right ah you know I I enlisted so that I listed in the air force so that I Would not be drafted because uh what is at the time uh my eyesight was failing\nAnd I wasn't too thrilled with the prospect of being drafted and dropped into the middle of the jungle what I was Nineteen years old\nWell Richard ... so what was the problem with with Nixon\nWith Nixon I wasn't going to put on the uniform and sacrifice myself for his politics is\nHe didn't learn the war he ended it what do you what do you mean his politics he didn't start the Vietnam Conflict that was started low heat on at the Kennedy was there\nYes that's true absolutely I I well aware that Mr Nixon did not start the war right\nHe escalated and he engaged in secret bombing\nAnd he ended the war he ended it he literally took us out of there\nWell ... in in what sort of manner we were we were chased out of there as Joe\nI mean we could have dropped a nuclear bomb there we want to do he said enough is enough and got us out\nWell actually he was threatening to do the very same thing you just said\nYou have a ... I'm not sure I understand well what part of he got us out are you missing wasn't Kennedy got us out of wasn't Johnson that got us out it was Nixon that got us up\nTrue right so I was a ... so you didn't have a problem with John somebody had a problem with Nixon\nJohnson that got us out it was Nixon that got us out that's true right so ... so you didn't have a problem with John somebody at a problem with Nixon yes that's interesting about all we can talk for two hours from ... you go because I don't know what the hell you're talking about I have\nNo idea why you would be on I don't get it you became a progressive but you can't describe because of Richard Nixon and his policies on Vietnam okay it's a editing nine four one packs Joe packs dot com we're coming right back\n[noise]\nPick ...

I I don't even have words for that it's outrageous but I don't think this goes over well in middle America I don't think it goes over well in most places outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts or\nMaybe it on the college campuses speaking of the college campuses this uh Georgetown professor we're going to be delving into more of this\nA Republican senators should die miserably be said to pigs for supporting cabinet and she has had a history of nasty comments about\nTrump's supporters uh and calling them all sorts of names and Raymond made the good point that\nCan you imagine if a professor who was even even modestly a Republican said anything\nResembling of it at the vitriolic nature of what this professor Christine fair at Georgetown said\nWhat that would that slightly Republican professor survive\nProfessor would be run off campus not that there aren't many Republican professors anyway would be run off\nCampus that that's that's that's a that's hostility you're expressing your expressing male aggression or if it's a well we already had one ... a male professor have to apologize for making a simple comment\nSimple comment about credibility and Christine Ford get into more of this but the double standard is just unbelievable the views of faculty\nMembers expressed in their private capacities or their own and not the views of the university does that mean if somebody express racist views on Twitter that that person would not would not be fired from Georgetown\nOur policy does not prohibits speech based on a person presenting ideas\nOr the context of those ideas even when those ideas maybe difficult controversial or objectionable well faculty members may exercise freedom of speech we expect that their classrooms in interaction with students be free of bias and geared toward thoughtful respectful dialogue\nWell when you go to go on that rate your professor website\nUm\nReviews of this particular professor teaching style come up a namely that she's frequently rants against conservative how is that unbiased but again Georgetown would not tolerate this and a conservative it wouldn't it would never happen\nThere is no discussion questioning or did they in her class you know simply sit and listen to her opinions which are frequently incoherent and disjointed worst or lectures or never supported just presented his unvarnished dogma this is not what Georgetown is about says the latest rate my professor rating\n[noise]\nSo this is um this is where we are in American academia if this if this were a Republican professor\nIn his private capacity tweeting support for Kavanaugh for anything at using the same type of language toward Christine forward supporters he would be fired they would figure out a way to run him off campus even if he were tenured that figure out a way to do even if they had to pay him that get them off campus\nDo you agree with me a five five forty Laura uh we'll talk more about this a and a woman who knew Christine Ford in at North Carolina state will get to that and a lot more coming up\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published page

have a right to the Supreme Court well accusations and accuser does not have the right to be believed\nThey just simply don't this message about women's than ... worth that we are to believe them simply because they're women simply because there are many of them are victims that there have been abuses in the past\nBut this isn't that the standard by which we judge people we judge people on facts rationality and the judge people\nBased on what can we presented in the evidence and not on feelings and this attack on Kavanaugh grilling how about you know do you remember blacking out the remember getting drunk how you behave in college and just always the presumption of\nOf guilt going forward and in every way that they have questioned him and it's it's completely dangerous inappropriate\nUh now describe if you don't mind your thoughts on on Christine forward given your a knowledge of her as an undergraduate right\nI I was a classmate of hers I wasn't in her ... friendship here but I was in her\nCircles and I know the environment that she was on that we were all in especially our freshman and sophomore year we were partying there was going out there as you know part of the sorority culture back then was was definitely a party culture and my point in bringing it up is not to blame her\nFor her you know if she were if she had been sexually assaulted that because you behave this way you deserve to get raped but my point is if you only have he said she said if you don't have any corroborating evidence then you need to look at the character of both people you need to look at what they were doing in college and I know what we were doing it in college and\nYou know we should be you know if you're gonna grill Brett Kavanaugh about this she also needs to be looked at as well because she's bringing these accusations without any kind of cooperating evidence and we can't forget that weight\nAnd she also mentioned college you mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual thought she said she didn't do well in college because of that yes she did well in high school you know really what was going on during that period sheltered change the timeframe from being\nIn the mid eighties or early eighties she kept pushing it back and forth but did it happen in college or happen in high school you know really flush out exactly what her story is she right on the stand the lawyer would\nGrill or about that they would grow her about the details of her comment but somehow we have to hold her with kids love\nAnd again feminists were supposed to be about equal treatment I thought that women are strong enough to stand on their own they're not a bunch a damsel in distress and yet\nHow you're exactly right on the incremental last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to the a credibility gap ah for moves forward a in relation to the entire matter and extensively relying on and\nOn an unbiased prosecutor who was a six month prosecutor who my political figure who said look changing narratives changing story of a memory of even recent events she seems to change or is unclear\nA not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a I'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard so no probable cause even to undertake an investigation\nProperty information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts then you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nWell that's exactly right it's about how she made people feel because I didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest\nI'm and she didn't she didn't vote like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing but so\nTrump traumatized her for four years to thirty six years affecting her college years and her marriage and everything else and redecorating and you know we had no emotion that corresponded with\nWhat she was saying creepy TST and trauma and horrors of it all was there would have been more anger\nThere were more fear and passion and more directed a she was attached she her anytime she ever talked about the assault she was very detached and her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can dissociate\nDissociate when they're raped and stuff but she wasn't right and this is thirty six years later and she said she has the TST which means that you're heightened in your awareness of what happened and so\nShe just did not she was not ... on feelings or effect but it as being in the day we need to look at the facts and\nThe fact that measure up she lives in an environment and in high school that was very party environment that carried over to a degree in college you think she got off campus after that and and things calm down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his allies if we're going to bring this kind of thing up at the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with a context to this right before Supreme Court nomination that would be changing\nAbortion possibly there's a reason for that you know we've got a really wouldn't need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this this isn't just about Ford or or ...\nIt's about our uh liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principle that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing behavior of\nAttacking people in public restaurants or elevators or you know that these are the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers and all are the ones who are the first to get in your face first one\nOh absolutely because they're driven by irrationality they've banned in fact they've abandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level so all they have their subject is kneeling and power\nAnd if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of object objective truth in order to have dialogue than the most powerful the biggest bully in the room it's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of ...\nTheir bullying everyone in order to advance their power and it's important that students can't there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always the threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over\nThose who are trying to use you\nYou know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on in different kinds of fears now it's going on in the titan relationship scare of men and women and its ripping our country apart\nAnd you know if we if this means that we have to let the races go free because we can't prove it it's better to stay presumption of innocence just said the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty\nOh I'm actually the back you know that's just real life that that's what it's about being in a grownup world\nThe activists Soros folks who are costing flake who lived up to his last name I mean they they they're perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from me it's like a kid like an eighth grader\nThis is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorists with the type of political\nAnd emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be\nExposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel they have to feel the heat right back on them as as a journalist and I say this in a\nIn a in a way meaningless journalists don't like to demonize the fake news and so forth would imagine of journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator\nWhere where citizens are one inch from their face screaming at them at it I think they'd be the first ones to say wait a second intimidating the press but what about intimidating a a a a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station is as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them and it does that count at all really not you\nKnow and and but we like you said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it which we've done for years and look where we are\nA and that is one of my reasons for challenging a\nChristine Ford about you know her own behaviors I'm not I'm not accusing or anything I don't know what she did detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment she with then and if again if we're going to prosecute him or questioned him prosecuting him then we need to ask her the same kind of questions\nAnd you know you can't answer if you can't show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in a political sphere then why should we believe me we're not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to power she just because you're allowed and bowling and yelling at us and and the restaurants\nYou know we're we're not you know we're not want to have to take it for you\nWe have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the Trump election was all about don't you\nI think uh it's about people having just about enough of bad policies bad economic policies bad foreign policy and\nTwisted a political correctness and identity politics I think he called BS and all of it and he said look I'm Out of it and I've done all these things but uh this is just ridiculous and I what before we let you go real quick do you do you think that this could actually boomerang against the Democrats in the midterms\nOh absolutely\nAnd I hope so and we need to get the word out the Democrats are very good about organizing on the ground base and then turns and we need to know

Stephanie Clifford idiot and you know my response to that was what are you talking about an MBA is legal documents on hush money harsh document I signed an Indian and worked at this company\nOr a promise not to give their secrets out while I don't understand why why suddenly has an MBA evil incarnate\nEvil [noise] 'cause it's handy a\nPresident Trump stands for\nDevil agreement or something I think it would be [laughter] new double agreement on disclosure agreement if it's a it's common in law in this country is not that it's not it seriously I mean many I somebody tweeting me they said my wife was a hairdresser and she had to send NBA as you wouldn't tell people how they were cutting air there yeah for God's sakes\nLet me go to the phone lines if there's a lot of people want to be hurting and and I don't blame you there's a lot going on today a lot to get too can be Mike in California Mike what's going on I\n... you know it's almost as\nIf you don't mind what your face on the phone 'cause it sounds like a far away on what's going on\nI'm actually sort of those Okay Jim ... is this a interview interrogation so I really kind of kept track I wrote down some of the ... and\nFirst of all it's not very common at somebody that's rape just going to use the word that guy might have accidentally kill them you're not so it was going through my head rape is a very horrible things very me you got daughters I got daughters you know we know what it's like to have girls\nWould by the way your phone towns grant writing you know don't don't do change whatever you're doing go ahead\nI'm parked on the freeway but no you sound real\nAnyways it's okay so you know this is the things started with her not even knowing it she was done or rape then it started with ... started going from there to her husband saying it was common all and nobody can really focus on the fact that she never knew who was\nShe just says that her husband was the one that told her they when they talked about the door\nThat one lady they did or to say that she didn't like the way their door looked and we know that when we live in a house and we're going to stay there and you have the money if you're white to like something you fix it\nIt was six years before she even thought about you know for years before the rape thing came up in therapy right within the therapy style match and I know that in therapy because I go to therapy there and that's pretty good but she also said that there is a wrong\nShe got away with saying that therapists notes for wrong but yet she was the one that said refer to my therapist notes right but then the one that really gets me and this is one that most people will know all women will know this one and even now with the ... when she grows go out together to a party\nAnd one of them doesn't leave with the other one there's concern you had a friend will start looking for so called so want to know what happened that would have been something they would have remembered\nAnd she was never there she doesn't know what she's talking about how could to France be that close\nAnd then at that night she ran out of the house now either she ran a front of her body like she was saying at one point or she ran down to nobody saw lead but either way a best friend will find out what happened to you maybe not tonight but maybe tomorrow they're going to ask why you left more happens right and the fact that she never even read ahead to this\nYou know I think something happened to the to what I watch you know a judge do something I've never seen in my life I'm ... thirty five years ago he had an alibi without knowing it date\nYet a calendar that shows and it's CNN\nDisgusts me well you're going to put up a ... show somebody's data on it but we've got the part that it's just football or weightlifting and stuff like that just shows why seven men right or you were getting the same like the same time right they just ignore this stuff and I spent the last four years going through a false accusation that I could record I didn't do got dragged into another court\nJust for the heck of it because it can get away with it and it's not right what it does to our lives and takes us away from\nThe things that we can't do anymore which is that going to do it did nothing but just like me sir but what do you want to get to the country but when somebody gets mad\nNow why if you cry and you're right if you're a man you're wrong if your military man God help you if you got kids start tracking stuff starts taking video and just start watching is it's going to get really ugly if they don't put him for a\nBike I Gotcha appreciate Joe we appreciate a you know my calling in from California you know what happens sometimes is when you're moving your doing whatever the cell phone to get a little bit shaky I'm Glad that he pulled over to some degree clear he's right these right on on all of those accounts a little ... said not just a man\nAnd not just a man who serve the country somehow but if you're a white man you're guilty you have to now prove that you're not\nThat's just the fact that that's the way it is in fact that's the topic\nA wedding
