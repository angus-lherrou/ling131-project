visiting forward in Hawaii we traveled around the Hawaiian Islands including one time on a propeller plane\nHe said while visiting forward in Hawaii we traveled around the Hawaiian Islands including one time on a propeller plane\nDr Ford never indicated a fear of flying to the best of my recollection Dr Ford never expressed express the fear of close quarters tight spaces or places with only one exit I assisted Dr Ford and finding a place to live in California\nShe ended up living in a very small five hundred square foot house\nWith one door oh no with one door because remember she had to have two doors on her because she's so afraid of one door that you had to have to\nDespite trying to maintain a long distance relationship I ended the relationship once I discovered that Dr Ford was unfaithful while living in Hawaii really she's the perfect person for the Democratic party she\nShould run for president to after the break a pie took her off the credit card we shared but nearly one year later I noticed Dr Ford had been charging the card and charge\nAbout six hundred dollars worth of merchandise when confronted Dr Ford said she did not use the card but later admitted to me after the fact and after I threatened to involve fraud protection\nI didn't speak to her again until about two thousand two\nWhen Ford contacted me briefly it's like um you know Barbra Streisand and I'm a Robert Redford they're like book and the two of them in the way we were\nAfter this I hadn't thought much about her until I started story in the Washington Post September sixteenth two thousand Eighteen I Do not want to become involved in this process or current investigation but wanted to be truthful about what I Know so there's the or the latest from I'm\nFrom Dr Ford you know you have you with the dirty glasses and Mao tse ... the hair and all of that and she can't quite remember I remember Brett Kavanaugh on one beer the rest I really I don't have any recollection of anything else\nI'd say let's go to Christine Blasey Ford since we're talking about Iraq for the record of\nTruthfulness and and this whole thing make no mistake all of this Brett Kavanaugh saga here already cleared all the hurdles all the traps been through the hearings thirty some hours of hearings before the idiots senators\nBefore Dianne Feinstein pop the cork on this on this doctor Christine Blasey Ford BS All right\nUh nothing that she says turns out to really be particularly true which might explain why her mother her father her brother's no one in our family\nWill have anything to do with her because she's a fruitcake at least apparently you know I wouldn't want to lead to any conclusion I mean if I felt it was going to destroy your career by calling or a fruitcake I wouldn't\nUh because uh I require more evidence I've got a whole bunch of evidence up all these witnesses that she named who say uh you know who brought Kevin ... never never met at a party at whose house where I I I don't know I don't know I never know not doesn't ring a bell those are her witnesses\nHeck of a job right so here she is on polygraphs from last week she was testifying she was under oath have you\nEver had discussions with anyone um Jerry attorneys on how to take a polygraph slump\n... well there's an update on that that was with the prosecutor women out of Arizona Rachel Mitchell or who was\nIn to do the questioning well Christine Blasey Ford's ex boyfriends says she helped friend prep for pets\nMitchell or who was brought in to do the questioning well Christine Blasey Ford's ex boyfriends says she helped friend prep for potential polygraph test Grassley sounds alarm in a written declaration released Tuesday and obtained by Fox News an ex boyfriend of Christine Blasey Ford\nThe California professor ... Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault\nDirectly contradicts her testimony under oath last week that she had never helped anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nYour former boyfriend whose name was rejected and the declaration also said forward neither mentioned a cabin or nor mentioned she was a victim of sexual misconduct\nDuring the time they were dating Nineteen Ninety two to Nineteen Ninety eight so this is yet another boy from can't hold on to win I guess he said he saw for go forward going to great lengths to help a a a woman he believed was her lifelong best friend\nPrepare for a potential polygraph test he added that the woman Monica McLean had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office\nFor the claim that for never voiced any fear of flying when they're aboard a propeller airplane and seemingly had no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment with one door I don't know any of this would be a problem with any of this be a problem yeah\nYeah All right now let's go to number fourteen this is willy guys of ah MSNBC\nHe is the least this honest which is like being the tallest ... in the room\nOn the circle fast known this morning jump and really guys this morning and they were all talking to their kicking around there already laying the ... they're they're shifting the ground this is willy guys on MS DNC this morning on MORNING joke with the pitching sisters\nI'm there he's telegraphing because these are the Democrats you don't have to wait for the Democrats on the hill these are the Democrats\nAnd what they're arguing now is well this FBI investigation will be declared inadequate and we will declare null and void and it will not affect our thinking or votes or rhetoric or anything else we're going to continue the blood drenched jihad against this innocent man this good and decent man\nWho has been slime by the filthy us gang of gangster slime ball in the history of American politics I think we'll I guess and this was in my best girl sitting there this morning\nAnd we were listening to it and I a lean forward a little bit and I think my best girl said oh here it is here it is the ground is shifting here it comes to have you ever had\nPulled up the idea that investigation is Jeff Flake and Chris Coons and others teamed up was to give her perhaps to Republicans and say look we looked into this but independent third party investigative body [noise]\nGive them cover to vote yet they say they clear judge Kavanaugh will now by not interviewing doctor for it and not hearing healing judge Kavanaugh as part of the FBI inquiry\nThan Goldman that it's not really a full FBI investigation think worry now you're giving opening to Democrats and other people say well this wasn't a real investigation to how can you possibly they'll get that I'm certainly not going to change my vote from no faith than anything that comes out of it\nWhat he's saying and he speaks for the entirety of the Democratic party as well as anyone else um is that they've already declared the FBI investigation to be a inadequate they're going to want to extend it until next year some time special counsel two and a half years later\nOr it's not about getting to the truth I'm it's just not about getting to the truth and all they have an interview Kevin on Fort they're pretending it's over and they haven't done in the news media is insisting that the FBI do with the news media wants them to\nWell they haven't interviewed Kevin on Fort they're pretending it's over and they haven't done in the news media is insisting that the FBI do with the news media wants them to do otherwise the news media won't tell them that they've done an adequate job now it's a Lynch mob a and unfortunately Lindsey Graham is Atticus Finch willy ...\nThe whole week long pause was supposed to get some clarity to it yes it while I'm afraid by leaving out the two key witnesses although they did testify under oath before the Senate only crowd that further and make them more controversial when the vote finally comes up later this week\nNow they're talking about jumping the gun and uh you know a little learning is a dangerous thing they declared I guess the FBI investigation to be over because they read something that said that it might have ended as soon as Tuesday Afternoon or Tuesday evening the FBI has not indicated that it's over and I'm ... and they're just saying what they're they're ... they're muddying\nThe FBI investigation ahead of time and uh that's what they're doing\nA Lindsey Graham let's go to well let's go there they are\nThey are laying down the credit here to oppose whatever the FBI comes up with tend to dismiss it and say well that doesn't change we need more investigation and more investigation and it is at that point that you will know that they are a lot I mean if you haven't wised up yet you're probably hopeless\nBut at that point you should know that you're just being hoodwinked you're there fraudsters right number seven Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham yesterday he might be the Atticus Finch of this Lynch mob story\nPeople can look at it and then we're going to\nHave the votes [noise] uh I keep telling my colleagues uh this is the new normal got hit the ball\nWho would want to be a judge in this environment and uh\nWe've got to turn this around forests too late taking Kavanaugh down\nWhat unleashed forces or from the dark side of American politics\nAnd he think only one side is capable of doing [noise]\nHe's warning the Democrat and this is this is true and uh you know millions of us are going to feel the same way if they're successful in taking down Kavanaugh with this smear jihad the darkest side of American politics will be unleashed\nLike the beast at the beginning of The Exorcist in perpetuity he said\nAnd uh that Lindsey Graham went on foolishly with his Atlantic thing Atlantic magazine and Jeffrey Goldberg\nWho is a fluff her for the Democrat Party\nAnd then he becomes a real rough and tumble Upper West side journalist when he was talking to Lindsey Graham and Lindsey Graham was having none of it and Lindsey Graham who's apparently gay but minds his own business and everybody's always accepted this in Washington for decades\nAh with all of her or hate and venom apparently Twitter suspended her account but only briefly

a\nI I just have great stuff on those emergency alert story it is it is hilarious the you know the president put out this alert yesterday what time was up to Eighteen is that what it was to Eighteen pm eastern time approximately takes a little time\nTo go through the system here America's a you know it's a blast textile desk goes out across the country and everybody with a cell phone\nI suppose I I don't think one hundred percent of people got them but almost everybody got them in a most people have a story I was at home might have my own business\nOr doing research and things and a mind went off and I saw it and so there there's that and I ignored it and got back to work and I wasn't triggered I didn't have a panic attack I didn't start shopping like Bradley Manning I I didn't fall to the ground and assume the seagull position like\nSo I didn't have a panic attack I didn't start shopping like Bradley Manning I I\nDidn't fall into the ground and assume the FICO position like somebody apparently did largely on the west coast so they notice there's a lot of us on the west coast the west coast I think is more on well then the rest of the country\nI Can't say that was certainly I've not conducted a scientific study but I Believe it to be the case and and I did live on the west coast for seven years after all and\nBeautiful and sunny Santa Barbara California\nUm I you know [laughter]\nAnd there are crazy people out there I have a wonderful story they they have an Obama administration officials lashing out at the Trump Administration\nFor daring to send out this text message and there's a great ironic twist in the middle of that let me tell you and all these left is the media Research Center the good people at ... dot org put together a collection of liberals responding to this and it is\nAround the city the city of homeless people and they're all coming because hey I'm a heroin addict and Seattle is the place for me it's like green acres and and they uh they all go there because it's a friendly environment for heroin addicts and then when asked about the city officials blamed\nThe rest of the country for not doing what they're doing and say all the heroin addicts are coming to us because of our policies but if everybody else had our policies they just stay where they are and this wouldn't be our problem okay that's probably a good idea what in what we think of the head [laughter]\nBecause this is are there\nIs is what Democrats do listen to a great deal to ah to get to all kinds of great stuff to get you out just have the cabinet update grudge hamster really gotten to yet\nAnd the FBI the big a highly anticipated I think they call it FBI report has been delivered the follow on investigation and it's been delivered to the White House and the White House has it and they put out statements and then I'll get to those and um the uh Congress but Senate has been given the documents the FBI report\nBy the White House senators now have access to the FBI report Democrats who are extremely corrupt in the Senate like Chris Coons\nWho's a very corrupt person is going to go in and read it and he's going to take notes on it or maybe photograph it with this phone if they allow phones in there and he's going to do everything you can to do a Sandy burglar and a leak as much as he can strategically of course exercising a few cuts are too late to the press\nTo spin this for the American public and uh CNN or MSNBC will start getting leaks any minute now actually they have to wait until the number of senators have a view of the documents so it's not too obvious who leaked it\nThey have to let some Democrats and some Republicans they're taking turns going into a secure room\nMaybe they're not allowed to bring phones and but they're not allowed to bring Penn so they can write notes and they're going to come ... come to the press but the Democrats decided ahead of time before the FBI investigation started ... were you when they were calling for an FBI investigation they knew already that it was an addict rich\nThat it would not meet their requirements they would have to reject it which is what the plan is for today and the media will help them with that\n[noise] so we have the FBI or reports ah which will start leaking any minute now turn over your eggs timers the Democrats are being given access to it [noise] it's not for public release but the dastardly\nDemocrats will be filling it out all over the much about the whole thing about just a sentence or two that they believe will help their chance [noise] because they're a Lynch mob I may have found a nice federal judge living quietly\nTree lined street in Washington DC and decided to mention and destroy his family and they're not done yet [noise] bony

sitting here wondering where is the attorney general whereas the apartment of justice surely by now there are there should be some investigation launched in regard to these leftist groups who's funding them I think we know what's going on and and what can be done about it\nYou know there was a headline justice more I got I have not had time to follow up yet I saw when I was on the air here where somebody from the other side is is talking about how um people were being paid to show up and engaging mob action\nIn Washington in this this most recent go round\nYeah I don't know whether the deal Jay is conducting any kind of investigation or any any enforcement action brought by the department of justice would have to\nInvolve a violation of federal law obviously it would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing this stuff and some kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws\nAnd I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the chief of police in Seattle and you've got and tea first thought was\nA rioting in your city smashing store front you know breaking up a places of business are hitting people over the head with baseball bats and um and the two by fours\nAnd and setting cars on fire you don't have to wait for ah for for a sessions or the department of justice prosecuted him arrest him put him in jail and if you're the the district attorney and\nYou know they don't want to put him in jail and uh so I think that's where the that's where the enforcement really needs to be getting his at the state and local level or the crimes are taking place let's go to Cheryl in Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened in two thousand eleven in Wisconsin with the newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give union members that choice public union members that choice in paying dues do you

parking lot\nUh there was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about it Governor Scott Walker he was successful the Republican\nFitzgerald brothers who control the state Senate and state assembly\nStood strong the governor stood strong and the book is called and intimidated and everything you're saying now happened in Wisconsin but the people were so appalled even the Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor was there\nAnd the people just a Wisconsin turn red there was that attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of recounts lawsuits everything you're seeing now\nUh happened in two thousand eleven against a successful Republican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budgets in Wisconsin I'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt a\nLittle annoying you know the Democratic legislators ran in ... so that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that\nRight when they ran\nRight they hit out and of course the Tea Party exposed where they were hiding in northern Illinois in a hotel it was just you know you couldn't carry on a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process and by the way organizing for America\nThe Wisconsin branch was a busy there that was Obama's group two thousand eleven act in a while\nAnyway I assure you may you make a great point I mean we we've seen this show before they previewed it in Wisconsin and the good news is a Walker one and and they made tremendous progress tremendous reforms in Wisconsin let's go to our Roland in North Carolina online sex a welcome to the program\nJohn ... thanks for taking my call on sixty eight years old I haven't drank anything thirty some years but when I was in my late teens\nAnd twenties when I was in the house and the navy we drank as much as we could possibly drink and you can log blackout ranking American beer\nUnless you were a I have an elfish something ... a\nNice that's very funny or are you know\nUh I probably drug my share of American beer I guess I'll confirmed what you would you say I I think it would be very difficult to ah to black out from drinking beer I don't know maybe it's possible I certainly never a shepherd\nOh it from drinking beer I don't know maybe it's possible I certainly never a server oh let's see let's take one last caller Kevin in Florida I live on five Kevin I'm Sorry you've only got about thirty seconds quick point\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] quick I I've I've watched the whole Brett Kavanaugh I watch doctor or a but it kind of relates to a movie\nA series called Thirteen were reasons why everything that happened in that series a from the gang rapes Tuesday drinking everything and it also happened to a very prominent kid in that are in that series\nAll right who knows you may be right we've got to go to a break we'll be joined by I guess Adam Michelle when we return\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Ginny cell sunspot correct her she says she loves it it's her go to product every day she has sunspots an age spots of can see a definite difference in her skin since using it\nAnd now a President Trump is really fulfilling his his promises a to pursue policies that lift the middle class that left people all across America not just on the east coast in the west coast\nAnd in particular that give opportunity to people starting out at the bottom of the totem pole it's really striking I think how successful his policies have been\n\nI agree I think we are sort of as an economist I knew that uh that that tax reform was good for the economy the regulations were were a drag on economic growth but uh it's been it's been incredible to see how how transformative some of these reforms can be at a ... ...\n... and reaching the power of the businesses to hire people when they need them and to ah to grow their business is how they see fit is that is really a transformative across the board\nIt really is you know I I check the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking basis are currently\nAnd it shows a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings that he's had\n'em and and a strong approval Rasmussen causes the approval index the difference between strong approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at zero doesn't that doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval index was minus eleven\nSo Trump's at at this moment is eleven points better\nSo we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something a ... what do you think ... are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some of each\nYeah you know I think it's a it's all the above and it's both the things that have been happening but\nI think the more that you think about what could happen in the future uh it it really is a stark discrepancy between the two futures that are are in front of us are right now that uh that that that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan repeal Trump's tax\nCuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what it needs but the average\nA tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax\nCuts that that was asked last year and the economic growth projected over over the future that tax cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars of last take home pay that that that sort of typical American can expect and that the\nThat that that that should be scary to to most Americans that that all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the ah with by simply repealing some of these big pieces that at the house and the Senate and the president have and have put through\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions enemies stops to answer their questions and there's a bunch of questions about the Kavanaugh nomination and and and there were questions about some other things\nAnd they start yelling questions enemies stops to answer their questions and there's a bunch of questions about the cabinet nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela and he said yeah if the Democrats get their way uh you know all these socialist they're popping up now that they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes in instead one after another they're coming out as socialists\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela you know you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more pets in the country the pets have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\n[noise] you take the the the record of of socialism or something like eighty six and zero it the way it's been tried more times than it should have been and each and every time it uh it it it's crumbled and and left misery and destruction at wake and\nSo I mean that's the that at a very high level that those are the two the two direction we can we can shoot\nThe promise of the tax cut the promise of\nOf putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money is\nBad rather than sending it to the\nBureaucracy in Washington and letting it sort of lost around lined people's pockets and then a part of it yet ... back out elsewhere that that\nThat is just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American and American businesses no how best to spend and invest their their resources and that's what we're seeing the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American uh you know under socialism some people always do very very well so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so if you're part of the ruling click or you're you're part of the the socialist in crowd yeah you can do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats and they can fry 'em up for dinner and that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially\nToward the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force in the labor force actually being able to get a pretty good paying jobs that are Michelle thank you very much for being on the program we appreciate

now I'm just saying no thought of it it's all good\nIt is a eighty nine four one package so ah the nuts and bolts of whatever we can do we needed to be more of an ...\nWell yeah I Do have I mean the latest of you would like it and you know Democrats are planning to do now\nLet's let's do it okay uh this is from Fox News a narrow confirmation them now justice Brett Kavanaugh over the weekend marked a major political victory for President Trump and the beginning of a new battle for Democrats who are now shifting our message to the written possible impeachment against the newest hike or justice and questioned the legitimacy and the Supreme Court itself\nAfter grueling confirmation fight than including graphic sexual misconduct allegations which the nominee denied Kevin was confirmed Saturday on fifty to forty eight votes\nCeremonial swearing in will be held Monday evening but as he joins the court replacing retired Justice Anthony Kennedy prominent Democrat single the fight over a seat and the court itself will extend will be on next month's midterms\nNow they went to impeach him it's an insult to the American public Trump's and Monday still fuming over the confirmation process and predicting Republican candidates would only benefit from the controversy in the midterms Democrats do maintain the fines energizing their core we will not step marching we will not stop fighting DNC chairman Tom Burris understatement over the weekend former attorney general\nSpain pain to find energizing their Corleone nonstop marching we will not stop fighting the in the ... statement over the weekend former attorney general Eric Holder said the courts legitimacy should be brought into question with the addition cannon uh\nSo I mean they're actually talking to an impeachment right All right so let's break that down who gets to impeach which body the house or the Senate and the Senate the house the house gets to bring impeachment\nThe Senate would say guilty or innocent or guilty or not guilty\nSo the Senate would actually hear the the trial the the house has to call for impeachment so I mean it's stupid it's a waste of time it's political wrangling it's dumb it's backward it's a disingenuous it's ignorant it's on and tell it could just keep going in\n\nThe house right now cannot impeach anybody because the Republican or I guess they could if they're if they chose to to be for they won't Republicans have a house or in support of Brett Kavanaugh\nOkay and um I mean\nThere's there will be no impeachment uh left the house goes to the Democrats in November now here's the weird part for me the Democrats aren't smart enough to know I mean I don't think they're dumb generally speaking but this is a dumb move\n'em [noise]\nThey don't appear smart enough to know that the Republican and conservative base doesn't want Brett Kavanaugh impeached and we don't want Donald Trump impeached just saying that he's going to be impeached\nIs ridiculous that can only happen if they win the house they're actually hurting their chances of winning the house so here I Am six six and want to have those on the other do I want them to keep saying that they're going to impeach so that more Republicans and conservatives go and vote or don't want them to stop saying it because it's so stupid I don't know\nI I actually don't have a good answer for myself when I asked myself that question self what do I want oh I like the Gary I'm gonna answer answer\nBut that's really where we are right\nI mean that that's really truly where we are we're at a place where either the house does it ... or the Democrats don't realize that they can and peace and let's say they have the majority and they don't not neither house in the house or the Senate um and they're actually telling voters vote for us will raise your taxes\nWe will send jobs away will make the unemployment rate go up we'll try to get a Medicare for all the tune of thirty two trillion dollars something we could never do\nOr we're going to impeach the president impeach the ... the Supreme Court justice that was just place be basic that's a winning combination they actually think let's let's abolish ice let's open the border they think this is a winning combination so I guess I kind of want them to keep yet but [laughter] I kind of wanting to keep on talking\nKeep on saying stupid stuff and at the end of the day where you're going to have is a a a Republican majority in both the house and Senate and then might gain and both the house and Senate so I guess and leaning towards keep on saying it I don't know I guess that's that's what I Want I I Would guess\nNow I think they're going to stop anytime soon either so\nI guess I just don't understand why they think democratic voters are going to be\nSomehow empowered to go to the polls the typical Democrats a center left leaning person is not a fascist there's not a far left is is not an anti fall below him person they're not an anarchist the average left or the average Democrat somebody identifies as Democrats they still believe in fiscal conservatism a lot of them\nAnd your son social stuff they they lean to the left they're not going to run out and try to get rid of this guy on the Supreme Court and I got to run out and try to get rid of the president that can run out and and and want impeachment and by the way you'd probably I think you're right you're probably still hear about impeachment for the entire run of this thing because\nAnd him and wanted peach bitten by the way you'd probably I think you're right you're probably still year by the beach for the entire run of this thing because the media although it will be they really care one way or the other about Donald Trump be pretend winter against them be want impeachment because if you would teach\nBut you got high ratings and we'd go to the ... to a judge\nI turn around you know hey you know what you got to have come is this the stop stupidity rack and would come is\nThis and I mean ... ... even though it\nI I'm applauded Democrat sheets that's falling these idiots\nThese people don't have no a deal or what they knew what or how to run a country looked at the last eight years of Obama that shirt show you what they let you all about\nGet your red hats on get chip but still the pole and get would help and if the economy get better don't\nSit there and go with the bamboozled ... wake up she ... the Democrats using your laptop bad habits come home depot is what they're doing it if they pick that motel you know I write them on a Monday\nThese idiots [laughter] around [laughter] okay with it ramble come on [laughter] the hideous\nOn making it bad for the real rape victims big time you got door to the fact that daughter and ... I Want to believe and go with if something happens too much out and I've got a son\nAnd my son I Want to make sure that he just don't get accused and he's able to defend itself right all you people wake up and understand what the Democrats could go on to this country are trying to do we've got to put a stop to it on November ... with the red wave\nThis will cut off the can use you know what's going on but big a motel you know and I know when you know and I know the Democrats never going to quit it don't matter\nHow human Asia you know Democrats and they're they're not people who were young when you about impeachment bigger so confused or maybe the Democrats who were in charge here saying impeachment do they really think that's going to work\nThey know where they go ... but they got the media behind didn't screw in all this stuff happened to the Democrats don't even know what's going on they they voters most of them don't even know what's going on that list they look at ABC CBS and they tell us the wrong and CNN and if you're looking at them\nYou know you lost in the shuffle that or\nDo they not getting the right information out to the people\nPeople or the Democrats genes get all the red wagon because you will prosper big time if you move away from them KKK double rats and ... they rats\nSo a Kevin O's in do you think he's got to be peace do you think the left his dumb enough to keep on running for election on impeachment I listen\nAll ready to president won he won because the one way more states that Hillary Clinton did he won more electoral votes he won he's he was the winner saying that you want to teach him and thinking to yourself well now that he's been in for almost two years\nAnd the economy is so good unemployment is so low new jobs are so high manufacturing coming back ... everybody got a tax break who pays taxes so a lot of your three to four million Americans got an actual check a\nBonus check from there from their corporations are companies\nWhat exactly is that you think he did since he won their vote for election that makes the now want him to be impeached and and the answer is nothing you're just dumb so again I guess I think I Want\nThe impeachment talked to continue because I think people who are rational logical thinking people will say well that's done I'm going to vote for that\nLet me go back out and say Hi to our daily lives in Michigan Hi Dave what's going on\nWell I just want to thank you for starting off your show today was shot down You're welcome your walk on the all star game from Battle Creek Michigan or their original Benton Harbor but when it\nWhen I did not know they were from Battle Creek I mean I obviously they're on Motown but I didn't notice from Battle Creek\nIn fact the drama\nAnd Harvard but what what I did not know they were from Battle Creek I mean obviously there on Motown but I didn't notice from Battle Creek in fact the drummer worked for me for Twenty years or\nSo yeah I guess it was some kind of blew my mind when I was watching the hearings with with uh with Dr Ford and they used in a question to her the word exculpatory\nAnd here's this woman that has a bachelors degree to masters degree in does she have more than one doctor but anyway she said I don't know what the meaning of that how they get there was a hidden message there but how could you see that and go to the scope and tore\nWhile she knows the meeting and how could she also not really know what it means to you know to ask how long was the polygraph she also didn't really know what it meant asking who's who's going to pay for the public before the polygraph she didn't know ... who was paying her lawyers and when I mean she gave a lot of answers when she said a lot of I don't knows\nBecause if you say I don't know you probably will get away with it\nUm but I've you know we're finding out about people contacting her friend and in front of pressuring the change in your testimony the whole thing stinks\nAnd it really makes the Democratic party look horrible it really does it makes them look at absolutely stupid and uh you know I'm okay with that I'm okay with them looking stupid open line now at a eight eight eight nine for one pack editing nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe ... dot com back out it's gonna be Chuck in San Antonio Chuck what's going on [noise]\nAlright Joe ... show proud to have an Internet\nSo that you know I Hope you're right that most Democrats are hunted down the metal but I worry because the courage that last socialist leadership is is using tactics that we're seeing the history think Bolshevik thing Fidel Castro think that way or\nThe you know what do you suppress any kind of dialogue you or marginalize anybody who is opposition you ban religion you get a anybody who is educational you don't allow them to stay\nAnd that is exactly what it is that most socialist leadership is doing and I wonder if the average Democrat realizes how incredibly dangerous that is to our nation\nI think that they will try to do the impeachment I think they will try to continue to oppose anything just because they shut down free speech and anybody that oppose\nAny I I agree I agree with you know what what what's next for the call man I I agree with you there trying to shut down anybody who disagrees with them and at the same time they're trying to say that he's shutting them down and like I watched the rally\nWas it last night or Saturday where he was in Kansas and he's just he's risen carry he was ripping it was it was a the Donald Trump show\nAnd he's ... he's just riveted he's pointing to people that he's doing this will be doing that and he's doing it just really just knocking out of the park and um and he keeps on pointing to the fake news in the back row and that's where all the news cameras were lined up\nAnd what he does that they play the victim\nThey tried to pretend like they're the ones who are marginalized they're the victims here and he's trying to shut them down\nWhen in reality what he's doing is he's reacting to their horrible reporting\nNow then you can go reporting how bad it is the reactor he's reacting to their fake news where they have to go and correct themselves all the time he's reacting to their lives about what he is or isn't doing\nThe only time that he really crosses the line is when he says we have to change or libel laws and our slender laws then I can hear you know them complain that complete would actually be valid but the complained that he's actually calling you out on what you said\nAnd I can hear you know them complain that complaint would actually be valid but the complained that he's actually calling you out on what you said the media things that I've looked at the constitution so several times looking for this line that says you know um you may not criticized the media it's not in their\nIt'll it says that the the press it will have to be freed the government cannot stop a free press cannot stop your free speech cannot stop your freedom to worship as you see fit it doesn't say that we're not allowed to comment on your press or your speech or your warship it doesn't say that\nIn fact it inherently protects my ability to say I think you suck as a journalist I think you suck as a media member I think you suck is somebody who claims to be a reporter and I'll say that from the highest mountain in America because my First Amendment says I can\nAnd they seemed to miss that they seem to lose that point\nThey seem to think that I'll give you an example\nCarry you're going to do a story of the top of the hour for the many radio stations that you do news for our people are allowed to say or people allowed to criticize your newscast and yet\nOf course they are will they be right I don't think there'll be right you don't think the ... one reported that way but they are a hundred percent absolutely allowed to comment on it and be negative or positive\nThey can say anything they want about it and the idea that people are gonna miss report on this president or report how he doesn't like it and he doesn't have the ability to hit back and say oh yeah you suck as a reporter you are fake news you're you're you're not going to get an interview and I'm like I'm a I'm not going to give you a sit down as I might give to Fox News or the two packs\nHe's allowed to say that he's allowed to criticize he's allowed to comment on what it is they're claiming is news and and I would have to believe that those who were on the news media are smart enough or intellectual enough to understand that he's allowed to respond that way\nI Know they pretend they don't think he's allowed to but he is now if he starts saying you're fake news I'm throwing you in jail that's a different story I'll actually staying on the sides of the journalists but that's not what he's saying he's just hitting them back\nAnd that bothers their their fragile egos their
