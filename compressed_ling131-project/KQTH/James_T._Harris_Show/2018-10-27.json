I can imagine I Know this guy should be out of the job you should be shouted out of the\nOf the county and it should not be able to be an education a gym in fact if you don't mind it give us the story I won't be able to hear the story of a gym in our free made Republicans completely against this award obviously for good reason I'm ... but if you can do a little something something\n... this is from the Miami Herald and Broward superintendent Robert Runcie received an award for his courage and the aftermath of the summary fourteen school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High were Seventeen people were killed another Seventeen injured\nThe council of great city schools honored run the with the courage under crisis and war and its annual conference in Baltimore Thursday night the council tweeted the announcement which the ... school districts the Twitter account shared the courage you all exhibited after a tragedy and stand that you won't talk after to make sure schools become save is absolutely amazing between Rand\nLittle information available about the award on line Andrew Pollack the father of meadow Pollack who was among those killed in the shooting share the news in Nebraska or in school district to count\nAnd quote this we're going to Robert Runcie is reprehensible pollen gross\nHe has culpability and creating lenient policies and Broward schools that cultivate criminals like the one that murdered my daughter and they weren't should be given to one of the MSG teachers that paid the ultimate sacrifice school district handling of the shooting and the events leading up to it are the subject of several lawsuits in currently under investigation by a commission appointed by the governor\nIs nuts man is to to me it's just so stupid made after this this shooting in these innocent deaths even had some sort of a get together some dinner where he was touting the praises the promise program he lied about this guy not having been the promise for a reason why he wasn't in high school\nHe wasn't a problem for them and middle school was guy\nAnd they're doing this guy awards editor you sleep at night these Runcie I don't understand it it's weird to me it just really as we go back to the phone lines I appreciate you waiting let me say hello and welcome to line one is Cathy in golden valley Minnesota Cathy what's going on\nUm thanks for having me kill you bet good to be on the ...\nUm I have a a sort of the Democratic platform is basically free stuff for everyone right\nOr the ... the size of the socialist platform issue as\nWell yeah but so we had I was nominated for I Know a a project manager and principal planner for Minnesota the in our school and I was nominated for an governor's award\nFor a project that I did excellent and I had a meet and greet\nWe have the ceremony and the rotunda and meet and greet with Tina Smith after the party for cookies and coffee\nAnd apparently\nThey had taken the cookies which were normal size cookies cut them all in half\nAnd someone had taken the time to cut them all and half and by the time I got around to getting to the cookies there were no more cookies so I find it very ironic that the socialistic\nPlatform of you know here's free stuff yeah is that you know we're going to cut it in half and you may not get it or not but\nNow here's free stuff yeah is that you know we're going to cut it in half\nAnd you may not get it or not but anyways that's [laughter] that's kind of debate I irony I find it was that you know that the free they cut the cookies in hacks\nFirst of all it's a TV a stupid thing to do that that's going to make the second thing why not make enough cooking is one of the ... and a half\nWell they they bought the cookies from you know cover or something like that there are some group place but\nTo cut them in half and then not have enough to go around I find it very ironic that\nWell it's it's the most part of its luster of of how it doesn't work your kid take what they were they were hoping to everybody you should tell people don't mix or cookies but it's really that simple I mean we could all have cookies and we all do it makes them if we're all waiting for free cookies are going to get a half or noon or ... I think it's a great point\nNeed the media since Reagan did so in that respect us two very quiet\nIf he so chooses without the filter and the media doesn't need the media essentials like Reagan did so in that respect just two very quite different styles and say play themselves out\nThere it's very interesting comparison to make and you're absolutely right um I I might be missed remembering this ... and I think that's the word Brian Williams said it was I I may be missed remembering this but Ronald Reagan appear to me to do more press conferences more news conferences where he would actually take the questions from the media\nTrump will do you know sort of announcements and he'll walk out in in on the fly he'll take some questions Obama almost never took up the questions he be quite frankly even though the media was his buddy uh he he didn't want to sit there and be questioned by anybody\nWhy do you think Reagan did that is it because that was the only available way to get it out there and because of that is that why it appeared as though he had a friendly relationship would they Sam Donaldson even even though the same delta was always you know she's working at um were sniping at I\nI I think your analysis is pretty good I I'm Reagan hit the script almost almost because the cameras pointed out and we're not as all he had to work with me at a message out he couldn't speak directly to the American people uh you know I I find\nTrump as a you know they they you can tell they study the Reagan that are certainly and other previous presidents they use the helicopter track you know\nYeah you know he'll sometimes it can you hear a question he wants to hear and not here questioning doesn't want to hear but right off the road or a a helicopter on his way outside\nI I I think it's true or Trump has not held nearly as many press conferences that's Reagan right he as he certainly against this law much to the meeting on just about every given day is you know when they\nWhen they all we know swarm into his office he'll answer a few questions now and then some\nOf the ... the bottom line is is the way the media African in right in states\nIf you wanted to get your message out you had to have a right right and that Reagan would do in in this day and age you don't you know so Trump is creating its own rules and I don't blame 'em forties just using technology to his great advance\nIt's John Hi Bush the executive director of Ronald Reagan presidential a foundation and Institute but it's interesting that you say that Trump is on television every day\nEvery single day and it's a new video soundbite a new video clip every single day or you're taking long form you know rallies rig\nI don't remember even doing any of these sort of rallies where he would show up in five ten Fifteen thousand people would be there he didn't do it from the White House where he did it from you know his ranch in and he would do the media there their piece every day I'm biggies that\nExponentially different to did Reagan do a lot of his campaigning like Trump is doing\nWell on a dirt campaign years right as Nineteen eighty porous reelect just like his initial election GO Campaign and boy did really well run a campaign that's no doubt about it but there again where I think Trump spin very inventor he's has actually said well kept with the old rules\nHe just never stopped campaigning for my mom when he announced to the President's Day and I don't think he's ever going to stop the way Donald Trump looks like it if you want to win reelection you better campaign from the White House we're from wherever you are every day a week\nAnd I think that if you want to tell your own praises in your own accomplishments you have to do it this way he knows the media cameras will be trained on him but he knows in a press conference in and I'm actually asking a question here I'm guessing he knows in a press conference he won't necessarily be able to tell his own praises is that what's happening\nLet's actually sell but I you know I think he's figure it out it's not against the law that campaign early you know so he's just inventing a whole new way to\nYou know to put himself from the American people a lot I don't I you know I ... I think whether I'm sure there are styles in the future for different presidents won't be radically different\nThey're probably going to pick right up words prop left off because a lot of boating\nThe ANC whether I'm sure there are styles in the future for different presidents will be radically different they're probably going to pick right up words prop left off because a lot of what he does actually works bullets\nInteresting it was John Hi Bush he is the executive director of the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute what's interesting to watch is thirty thirty five years later Ronald Reagan is praised by both sides\nAnd the media doesn't necessarily ever say anything negative about um this guy I don't think a hundred years from now the ... going to see anything good about them so it it's almost like a Reagan walked slowly carrying a big stick it out a big smile worst Trump just gets in your face is that in in your opinion is that'd\nBe the stark difference between the two because when you look at accomplishments like you said they're almost exactly the same\nYeah it's a it's a fascinating question you post because I I think about that every day I Trump is not such a bright white light yeah at the relationship so intense that I too cannot imagine twenty thirty forty years from now somehow\nThat dates media looking back you know and listen dear mentors tourist Donald Trump in residency fashionable but also say during the ranking takes\nYou never thought it would have been imaginable either a you know or they may not a bad ass as soon as intensely war with each other not not at all but Reagan was the target of the liberal press every day he was an office there is no doubt about it and\nIt's only really because of his remarkable successes but as you look back and I'm In history the facts are facts are stubborn things and and people not look at the Reagan presidency and they have to give a damn what side of the fence that you might be our\nGuide reviews John Hi Bush executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute I'm I Wonder if you have an opinion on this and all of anybody's ask you this before but\nWhat was Ronald Reagan's um relationship with the media going in Donald Trump for forty years was a media darling in New York LA Washington everywhere they loved him because he met money they put him on people would watch the show\nAnd they put 'em on people would advertise on the show this yeah this relationship went downhill in a matter of three years that's all we're talking about here three years ago\nRight before he announced he was still let me do you darling was Ronald\nReagan in good with the media before he ran or ... I I get the feeling that he was\nThey were actually he was it was really hot yeah yeah you know I mean you got to remember\nReagan as started off as an outsider even with his own party they ever on many many thought he was way too far to the right so but at the end you have to remember to want to wait for Reagan's first election he was down to Jimmy Carter by ten points you know it was not certain that he would when\nAnd when he came to office the press you know he was this is Amy of Don ... he was you know right wing not\nEverybody I learned about bedtime her bedtime for bombs or whatever it might have a headline everywhere right\nAbsolutely and that you know they make fun of writing and saying I can only speak if he was speaking off of three by five car and you know it wasn't smart wasn't well read it was that was absolutely not the truth and I think as Reagan continue to perform\nIn like Trump succeed and achieve his goals are they they ... they had to change their mind about Reagan I think by the time he got into a second term\nThey started to understanding what they had the front of them already saw reading him for his successor was but it really did take you know you know darn near or one or two more presidency's before the press release started the ...\nKind of amazing or a last question I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repairing this relationship where do you see them going forward just doing exactly which worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's uh\nOthers Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see them going forward just doing exactly which worked so far because I mean frankly the media might say that he's a failure he's horrible and he's or something of ... and something else but the bottom line is these crowds\nOf a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see him doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if they walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing hog the press is not going to happen and and that's because it's interesting it it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but but now that\nThe media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah that's a very different thing I don't think the media and I I think they kind of a\nNa you know that the ... now and and now

of tells you what's going on\nI'm currently in Georgia but normally I'm listening to W. came out of Kalamazoo\nOh beautiful given Kalamazoo what's going on well I was calling also about the um tax cuts [laughter] okay um well\nThe mainstream media has this very interesting way of twisting thanks so technically there is a demographic that is not\nThe benefit of tax cuts so if you've got ... you could do this and two minutes later on at your own convenience since you got to ask dot Gov fill out the ten forty put\n'em got married filing jointly with three kids put in fifty thousand for adjusted gross income do the math exemptions deductions you can't get a tax cut because you have no federal tax liability\nThis is the thing I get into a mainstream and wall and social networks and everything I mean I get into big fights the Turks some\nEverywhere I tell them you know the people that aren't getting a tax cut can't get a tax\nCut because they weren't paying literally correct\n... although I mean it but if you look at it for the Democrat way if you didn't get the tax cuts you could have given them more earned income credits or some crap whether you could have given them money back even though they never paid anything in I mean you're right it was real and what what what I said was anybody who's paying income taxes got a tax cut\nThose people who didn't get one that you're talking about weren't paying them so my statement dusting world\nOh of course yes I'm saying that's the ... the ... you know that that's what the liberal media is putting out there saying oh the poor people are just getting taken advantage of all not through all the talking about you don't pay tax right\nRight so he goes oh so it's a it's a it's a species arguing and they know that I've got a quick story by about ... and I I called them sink I guess it's ... or something I don't know\nBut I was at CNN about ten years ago eleven years ago they were trying to see if we can get an a left right show going and they had me going up against the air with Michael dice shouldn't be up and goes Roland Martin me up against Rachel Maddow was one of the people\nAnd then it was me and this this sink under guy\nAnd first of all he's about a foot shorter than I was which I found to be out and I think they had them standing on a box\nAnd and and as soon as they still they sort of said already here we go you know I read whatever's on the teleprompter and then we're supposed to argue or debate about the topic\nAnd this is again you know and and and I'm tired of this stuff and this is a bunch of garbage what do you think of it that he went\nHe yelled at me the whole time it was the weirdest thing and I looked at the guy he said what are you doing because I knew that we were actually trying to get a job you know which would have been sort of a cool back and forth to cause they got rid of cross fire a long time ago but they were considering bringing something like that back\nAnd and I and I looked at him I just looked right after they said they would stop yelling at me this doesn't make any sense and I think it was actually about Obama and the birth certificate and he said that no Republican has ever been questioned about his citizenship or his right to run and they said Oh yes John McCain was\nThe regular folks are underestimated because we can weigh both sides and we can make the decision of what's right and watch wrong and it'll come down to it no matter what they say in the end it's the voter\nAnd I am I I I agree with you but I don't look the people you're giving them too much credit I think people like you and me we we certainly get it but you know there are a lot of people out there that don't get a don't want to get it on trying to get it and we'll be ignorant effects even when you're handling them\n[noise] yeah like you know what history will say and let it be sad that our people you know\nGet the right thing which is go but I Know where everyone\nShould go to does voting polls and vote and we should decide what's right what's wrong but overall I think we should support our good president\nI'm with you a job that you get everything you wanted to get out because I've got to do something Oh yes ...\nAnd Martin leaning tower off now what's that one of those on your rights when you're talking [laughter] and I'm like oh let me ask you this\nCarry those will be my getting soft or general deserve it because normally she says you are ... love carry and then I'm going to just ... you don't mind raw she held on for an hour is over\n... yes as you said yeah she had a lot to say so you\nDid a good thing with Carol ... told me I should feel bad you've read as you should\nYou should veterans say it's called the week it kinda hungry as long as it

I'm Glad to your show again high uh I'll tell you that was running across\nGoing on well\nUh Hi I'm Glad to your show again by a ... put it that said that was running across I ran across a a a website called the cut it never heard of the cut okay well I'm reading\nThat and evidently there's a lady she used to be a she was on a Fox\nShe's a political commentator and a former congressional press secretary anyway she was evidently ah after she was on Fox News it says in this article that she uh was contacted by that God that\nStood out the bombs he used his middle name or what she did was he make threats towards her and she reported it to Twitter he ended up like on a couple of her account and posted her a ... threat so she reported it to Twitter and a\nShow where he had gotten her picture and then set all this stuff to her and a Twitter she complained of them that she thought he was fine with it and\nIt has to do nothing about it\nYeah they didn't rise to the level of uh like\nHe was dangerous of abuse their views and the evidently there were some outcry over it but uh anyway I Would look over at that if you\nWill jury I think I think the Jerry earlier said dirt and use it but there were some ... I did yeah when I was hearing person that is yes I Believe she said at the same person you know she\nYeah she tweeted just a yesterday she said well wait a minute she said hey quarter the guy that you are ah that I report and guess what he's saying here is hey where to remember when I reported the guy who was making threats towards me\nAfter my peers on Fox News and you got sent me the U.S response on how you didn't think it was serious we'll get to the guy is and then the bombs he is forgot and then the bombs to the high profile\nWell how would you how would you oppose the bill yesterday they just arrested him today she actually said it before the rest of them\nKnow it was six forty five that she posted that\nTo though it was so ... okay so was this morning or worse than I\nKnow it's tonight\nOkay or don't you yeah I thought you said yesterday okay we'll Jerry I hear you and I appreciate you carry it was on his earlier so you'd be around these you know I think yeah I appreciate that it's on top of that I mean really we give your own for the abs\nAnd because you have to admit to you were right you know what I mean [laughter] come on who's going to be some more reasons than that right the ...\n... ... C I thought it was in a low carb diet if you'd be having to talk with voice [laughter] okay everybody on the editing nine four one package editing nine four one Seventy two four seven Charles is you know Massachusetts Charles what's going on I\nWrite I Am just a for a for a hot I just wanted to ask that I I just feel are going to vote straight conservative a ticket as much as you can in the state but as I told your screener earlier there's not a single Republican a representative in the state of Massachusetts and the two senators\nAre quite a good or a Democrat and I'm just I'm just concerned that a ... with one might pull it off I mean I don't know I mean I I Know that you interviewed a Jeff deal but I I just I just wanted to get you what your feelings on on on first of all I'm afraid that\nThis uh situation with ... or ... or you know people might forget it I don't forget it certainly and ah I think that uh it was\nThis uh situation with ... you know people might forget it I don't forget it certainly and I think that day was and what ...\nWhat do you what are your questions about deal but he seems to be I mean it sounds dumb but it seems to be the real deal I mean why not vote for him if he sounds like he's the right guy if you want conservative a conservative in that seat I mean anybody to the right of of Elizabeth Warren would be better with ...\nThat that's what I'm gonna do it but I'm just wondering what what you are a assessment as well as so far as a whole as to how the election might come out this is a gas there I mean you you you talked to a lot of people I just wanted to get some idea that people are concerned well in the house is going to go to the uh if the house goes\nThe wrong way and I guess she uh uh people trying to carry on this investigation which has gone on for two years of the president right indefinitely and I just wanted to get your feeling on it as a as a host in a completely different part of the country\nWell I'll tell you what I've been saying and I and I really do think this is going to be two to four seats in a ... increase on the uh in the Senate I think the Republicans or conservatives will gain seats in the Senate\nUm I think that on the house it's a toss up I don't know what's gonna happen in the house I Hope that the the energy that the writer got out of what happened with Kavanaugh will continue I Hope that the tax cuts that'll continue I Hope that jobs coming back that's going to continue it really it look at the bottom line is this going to come out to turn out\nThe left is going to turn out they always do the right needs to turn out to make sure that we keep things going on with the going I think that lives with Warren is in trouble no she can lose out of low but when it comes to the actual numbers house and Senate or the Senate is pretty firmly going to stay Republican I think that the house is still a toss up and could certainly go left if people ... don't go and vote\nHe like that that has to point I mean you've got a someone like a I Believe that someone or all the same general philosophy as a Ocasio Cortez in New York that is taking a seat for my uh uh I think if the seventh district whatever I thank you very much\nI appreciate you think you are you got a lot of people who are saying that the Elizabeth Warren is up by a lot\nAnd I'm good I'm looking at the polling here I I Hope that Jeff deal still has a chance\nAnd perhaps we'll have um a corner on soon to talk about this ... is the guy who I turn to when it comes to what's happening in Boston in Massachusetts and even actually is very good great brain on him and he does he was a great show on under your kale Monday through friday noon or so we'll find out I mean he certainly will even it was promising at last we spoke\nBut I'm at this point I mean I'm looking at the spread and she's up by twenty five points to thirty six points in some of these polls I'm not sure how good these polls are uh the latest one is a plus twenty five and this is from UMass Lowell\nSo I'm not really sure what if anything can change their but still to me it looks like at least two seats will be gained in the Senate by the Republicans if not three or four it's eight eight nine four one packs editing nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe ... dot com coming right back\n[noise] hot [noise]\n\nMany bedrooms bedtime is

I didn't forget that so here we go to America [noise] Adam\n... way back we talked about first responders and I kind of wanted to throw that out again today because of an incident that happened\nRecently with a a dear friend of ours his wife got in a very serious car accident and he was relating this story that are the people\nThat showed up the police the ambulance and then the the the surgeon\nAt the hospital all these people it was like a a symphony of making sure that this gal was going to be okay and so at listening to his story it made me realize that you know at the end of the day when things happen\nWe want those first responders to be at the top of their game right trust and we want them to have had a good night's sleep we want the surgeon to not be drinking caffeinated coffee we want them to I'm kidding but we want them to be at\nOut of the annuities out of the life insurance and you're right the markets backup\nYet have you hurt your annuities or have you hurt your life insurance now and we explain all that to you ... come to a greater understanding and appreciation just adds to the leverage that these vehicles can provide\nSo that's something that you really I encourage you to consider it to me it's all about positioning\n\nAnd part of this means that you have to have the guts the the the the inter intestinal fortitude to go look I Want to address this now is\nIt a popular topic you'd probably at this point of view I gather the kids around the room you're telling and go play go outside more what Mark's talking about is not for your ears it's PG Thirteen it's like oh my goodness the stuff he is saying is going to happen looked a math\nDoesn't lie it just doesn't and so this movie\nIf you'd like to see the trailer the two and a half minute trailer to the power of zero you can email me\nI had a gentleman I emailed it to me [laughter] he emailed me back he goes to this is scary stuff you know it's almost so scary people dismiss it they got there's absolutely no way this was going to happen so here's the question what if I'm wrong\nWhat is this stuff never happens have we heard you by how we position how we re deploy how we put you in in areas where we are protecting\nWhat you have a mass what you have created what you have grown the answer is no we aren't you know\nWell let's say I'm right you will come out on top you will have done that\nYou don't you know let's say I'm right you will come out on top you will have done the very best the most prudent thing you can do at this juncture by position yourself for what I Believe is inevitable this is not politically expedient aren't you\nJust tired I Know I Am and I noticed Asian plays the ads and all I'm just tired I'm sick and tired I'll use I'm sick and tired frustrated over all the political ads that are running and the name calling and listen to that and to that and it is and\nYou know what it's just I'm I'm done with it I mean can't we taught those people all of them my opinion they don't really care and this is my opinion mark any can write me hate me hate mail whatever\nThey're in this for them they're in this for them it's not politically expedient for them to say you know what we have to raise taxes you have to cut benefits we have to switch the\nFull retirement age for Social Security nobody wants to say that because then they're not going to get reelected but what I'm saying to you right now is so important that if you don't have\nThis you're not going to be positioned to take advantage of when the bad news comes\nSo here's a couple of questions I Want to ask you and oh by the way that two and a half minute trailer just email me mark at more F. S.\nDot com market more F. S. dot com emailed me I'll send you the trailer no hooks no catches no obligations just something you need to know in fact at the office we are we we we kind of kid ourselves back and forth we say you know what\nNot only do most people not believe this message\nMost financial advisors don't believe this message they are not talking to people about what's coming because at the end of the day they're

superstar within your family with in your neighborhood\nWithin your world there'll be looking at you going well how did you how do you know this was coming well you know I listen to the smart money moves on Saturday and he's talking about this I went and saw the movie the power is zero I saw the trailer I've read the book I I I'm now more students now more aware of what's going on in our world and why\nPaul kitchens are not talking about this\nThe presses are rolling the printing presses are printing money at an astronomical rate and as a result we are putting our kids our grandkids in harm's way\nWhat's the message the message is and then we'll talk about these questions here what's ... what's the strategy here's a strategy your weight and you've got your pen pencil and ... taxes are on sale\nToday pay the tax get it over with just be done with it\nPut your money in a in an environment where it all grows zero tax will mark what if the government changed the laws you know there's always that opportunity yet you're right\nBut historically what has happened is if you're in certain vehicles where its tax exempt when you go to pull it out they grandfather\nThose policies those plans that are already in place so don't let that concern you what should concern you is what this trailer is two and a half minute trailer is saying to you\nSo don't do what the politicians are doing which is sticking\nAnd you is what this trailer there's two and a half minute trailer is saying to you so don't do what the politicians are\nDoing which is sticking their heads in the sand and hoping that it blows by them at least so that they can get reelected what you should be doing is saying what do I need to do today to protect my kids and my grandkids and my family what am I doing today to protect them\nThat's what the message is pay the taxes they get it over with taxes are on sale is that debatable will I get and get all these calls ... taxes are on sale look at look how much I'm paying my taxes\nYeah I get that\nBut if worse if we're spending a trillion dollars more than we're taking in every year and what what hasn't helped is the fact that tax rates were cut I think about that I\nMean I Love Trump either what he's doing attach races were cut tax rates were cut in spending has been increased then it's a it's a double whammy right\nBut it's not too late for you

develop a strategy that would prevent you from being hurt by any of this stuff\nAll the stuff I'm mentioning over the last twenty four minutes ways what if it was possible to develop that strategy so you wouldn't get hurt would you want to know about it if I'm waiting in the roadway the bridges out ahead the bridges out ahead go down this road and you might be thinking well as march tricking me is that real really safe\nIs that it's safe\nSo that would be question number to look the bridge is out ahead it is out ahead I'm here warning you right now and then if we were to develop a strategy where you are always safe it's kind of a two part or here would that be good enough\nIf we only stay safe and we never make any money is that really what we know we're going to help you get position so you can take advantage of what I said a little while ago when this stuff happens\n\nBecause we will still be here it's just a matter of what will the state of the economy will be looking like\nAnd when things start to rebound don't even want to take that back up that's when everybody gets you for it that's when everybody's excited hey we've been through the worst I'm throwing you today on this

like that happened to you we're going to talk about that coming up here and just a little bit we haven't mentioned long term care in a while and then look am I going to continue to beat this horse yes I Am because the message is so important you need to be prepared for what's coming\nAnd when you see this movie when we invite you and you come in and you see a Seventy five minute documentary about where we're going as a society\nIt will certainly be very sobering and you'll say mark I now know I Need to do something the two and a half minute trailer will do that as well so make sure he emailed me market more F. S. dot com coming up we want to talk about long term care coverage and\nWhat it means because it's not about you going into a facility it's what happens to your family as a result of that is not about the risks it's about the consequences\nState to more of smart money\nAnd put them in a much better position you know it's great to say hey I said you're a bunch of money but yeah look at the new the new benefits is like there will down to almost no he's going to walk away he and his wife are going to say oh my goodness you position does better and gave us more benefits for less money\nI go yeah isn't isn't that what we're supposed to be doing and more financial that's that's why we're in business we are here to put you in a better position to position you so when this stuff happens that were just been talking about and I had this conversation with him there Bob in their heads up and now going yeah we got we got to be prepared for this and you do\nSo please give us a call two nine six four four six four we are here for you this is about you this is not about more so what's the message to the messages the bridge is out ahead the bridges out ahead\nAnd people asked well how how can insurance companies do what they do mark you talk about a lot about insurance look I'm a a investment advisor representative\nAnd so I can put people in the markets I can charge fees I can do all that for ... area and all that but the message today is is what I'm saying is true then you really need a safe\nHaven you need to migrate towards what the insurance industry is offering why is because they had been built they have been designed for times like\nThis today is the day draw the line and this and say I'm going to call Mark I'm going to call the team right now I'm going to make an appointment what are you saying has captivated me\nOther people that I listen to I talked to I go on I ... they're not this is not their message\nThe message is not hate attacks today and get it over with\nThat's not the message to the message is max out your four one K. plant by term insurance match once you ... if I make sure you do an IRA do this do that it's all about for the most part rates of return I don't want to play that game because it is a game\nDon't want to do that won't go there and won't do that so give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four I have to mention this thing as well\nAnd I think it's important and it it dovetails very much so and what we're talking about when it comes to long term care and I I'm hoping my prayer my uh\nMy hope is that we can get Mr Harley Gordon to come to town he's a uh you'd probably one of the foremost a elder care attorneys in the country and he's written a book\nAnd so I said a little bit ago before the break we're going to talk about his book it's called the convert station called the conversation and this is what are you know trust instead it's this conversation people don't want to have\nThis how how apropos to ... book\nAnd the subtitle is helping someone you love plan for an extended care event\nIt's easy for me and I'm I'm not going to do this but it would be easy for me to take out all the statistics that are out there about how many people are going to need long term care how many people every sixty four seconds are diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia\nYou know what that does not connect with people we think as agents that it does it it will put people in a position of they start to worry they get anxious\nThat does not connect with people we think as agents that it does it it will put people in a position of they start to worry they get anxious\nThis anxiety they've created say wow I Need to pick up the phone and call those guys one person every sixty eight seconds is being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia wanted to ask me well folks that doesn't encourage people to do the planning it just scares them into maybe not doing anything\nSo Harley's book really brings front and center the idea that it's not about now I'm Talking to the guy here\nWhen they get this it's us guys we have a hard time with\nA guy guys men gentleman it's not about the risk of you ending up in a facility or having to have care\nThat's not what's at stake here that's not the issue that's not what you're jeopardizing what you are jeopardizing and this is the real message\nIs the consequence of you not having a plan the consequences of what's going to happen to you I'm Sorry to your family your kids your grandkids your spouse should something happen to you this is Carol is\nIn fact if you don't have a plan it is likely that will it will tear your family apart\nIt will tear your family apart\nNot having a plan and not properly funding it can disrupt all efforts to secure a sense of financial viability as you and your family move into the future that's what not having a plan will do\nYou know what we have a deep as a gay guys again women you can don't have listeners but us guys\nWe by nature heavy deep seated aversion to thinking about anything truly awful occurring do you like nobody nobody gets up in the day hey what if I get in a car accident today what if I have a stroke whatever Mart nobody likes to think about that stuff\nOr do they like to think what if I have a need for care what if I'm going to have to have somebody paid me feed me clothe me take me to doctors appointments\nAnd so as a result because nobody thinks about it the subject is dismissed and that's what ... contention is\nThat being more the case certainly when you're talking about hey you need to own a long term care insurance policy so what Harley's hope when he put together this book was to change your mind by altering how the subject is talked about\nWhat I Hope to do what my goal is when I have this conversation yeah the conversation and nobody wants to have is to say this\nIs that when I'm done I Want you and your mind as say mark Jeff really the conversation the consequences are too severe\nThat I Need to take action I Need to do something because I don't want to put I don't want to have my kids my grandkids my spouse left to deal with this\nSee one way or the other you're going to be kept safe if you have an incident you have an extended care event they are going to find a way to take care of you we know that we're here in America right somebody will rise up something will happen whether you have money you don't have you will be taken care of\nThat's not the problem the problem is what is going to happen to your family it's about your commitment to protect your family regardless of what happened\nTo your family it's about your commitment to protect your family regardless of what happens to you the book talks about as he says you're the serious and often irreversible consequences providing care\nCan have on those you invited into your life I think about that\nThe consequences to those you love you said yes to the altar you\nNow have embraced over the years you saw them through elementary school and middle school and high school and college and now they have careers and now are they going to have to put their life on hold see we have that conversation that's a conversation a lot of people don't want to have it hits you square between the I just like oh my goodness\nWell Mark I don't think that's ever going to happen well okay let's have a plan so just in case it does happen look you're going to be fine\nBut it's the consequences to those you love and you care about those are going to be the ones that you might be doing irreversible damage to should you not have a plan in place\nThat's what Harley's book is about a I Believe it's in reprint right now they're they're printing more and so we're hoping to get some of those as well that may be a give away you you want to call you say mark a when you get a copy of the conversation yes what do I have to deal you have to come in you have\nTo have the conversation with us and then we'll give you the conversation but look if you don't want to have your family put their lives on hold to take care of you then you need to have a plan in place that's our our encouragement to you have a plan in place\nBecause this is what Harley says and I'll conclude with this he says\nWhat most people don't understand is that extended care is not a series of risks that would happen to them but rather a set of serious if not irreversible consequences that would happen to those that you love\nThis is risk\nVersus consequences that's really at the end of the day what this is about so give us a call two nine six\nFour four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five two three five nine for six five will you have this conversation with us at more financial we hope that you will\nA couple of months ago I talked about the perfect financial plan\nThe perfect financial plant is that possible we believe that it is in fact society dictates to us that whatever it is that you as an industry put together it needs to be simple it needs to be efficient and so we're happy to let you know that we have figured that out this does\nLack of understanding and knowledge and that's really been one of my main desires just let's just get the\nWord out and let people make the best decision for that call more financial

media\n... thinks that Americans actually are going to believe it however I personally see now because the real war that as being waged is done on line pulled the political war\nAnd I personally have left wing friends who now kind of come out and said this has gone way too far it's way too obvious due to the timing of it\nAnd I let let let's just get real here let's just get real here just for a second I mean who really males a bomb to people who don't even open their own mail\nThat's where this goes Leon is here with me go ahead and\nContribute please you know I thought about that as soon as

Republicans are out pacing Democrats in early voting in key states and this is coming from and B. C. [noise]\nUh yes the Republicans are coming out in droves they are putting their early voting ballots right in the mail as soon as they get it the left wing is hoping for what dead people and illegals\nWell that certainly looks like it is and that's why we've got of course such big caravans of illegal immigrants heading for the United states this is a democratic voting bloc\nThat they desperately need and that's what you really see here is desperation if you're a Democrat a strategy us let's say and you're planning on this big blue wave coming through which historically it does during mid term elections\nA strategy us let's say and you're planning on this big blue wave coming through which historically a does during mid term elections you lose this one and the Republicans keep both the Senate and the house and you've got an apocalypse for the Democrat\nIt would and not just the Democrats for the elite for the ... this is devastating that is the aluminum ... who clearly has orchestrated this caravan and many more to follow they are behind is just not just Democrats Democrats or the little people okay that are millions that are stupid\nThat are the toy soldiers that are the horrors\nOf the ... said you use the word or an I'm allowed to use the word or because it's in the Bible so for any of you fake Christians out there ...

Ecuador or whatever other country they've come from they're here to take you over ... plain and simple they're not even hiding it and the only\nOne who is trying to be the deceptive con again is the

what we're looking at at this caravan that the ... the cons and the media that the press the huge once you do think they are part of the invasion to they are the enemy CNN is the enemy\nAnd that's LSD

pond sacrifice there's times where you have to sacrifice the ponds for a greater good you looming Audi will gladly do it and I daresay here in the political environment in which we live\nI think that the Democrats might if this gets worse and the NBC\nPoll showed that the Republicans are showing more and more support\nIn the next two weeks and I don't think it's going to I don't think it's just going to shut down and I don't think that that the Democrats are going to get a search I don't think so I don't think this is enough because I see the war that's being launched online and they're losing even left wing people are waking up so what they might have to do is sacrifice one of the big boys\nOne of the one of the rocks well don't have the nights wouldn't you say that there is an air

very risky gamble on their part because there are a lot a lot of Americans I daresay the majority of Americans\nIs a very risky gamble on their part because there are a lot a lot of Americans I daresay the majority of Americans\nWould not want this whole\nCaravan become entering the United states no no not at all even if a Trump send troops to the border and if he shuts down the border there'd be a lot of people in America that will rally behind that but when you take very risky gambles\nIt tends to show that you're desperate and I believe that is where ... with what you were mentioning regarding Republican early voting\nThis is not part of the playbook this was not part of the strategy for the Democrat Party they wanted to build a wave even before election day whether I have\nA democratic early voting total that is not coming to pass\nAnd furthermore I say these things to protect the livelihood of not just\n... just not you know your your average American out there I'm trying to protect real immigrants from real misery 'cause guess worthy let's just take a wild guess where are these new migrants these illegals where are they going to live in America\nI dare say they're not going to live in the white neighborhoods in the foothills\nThey're not going to live there they're not going to live amongst white people at all really not the majority a few of them probably will but the majority will not and I'm Talking like Ninety percent they're going\nIn South Tucson they're going to live where a lot of real immigrants live and so now the real immigrants have a real choice you know the Democratic party seems to have my back\nBut I'm the one who's going to have their car broken into I'm the one who's going to have some my kid get bullied in school by all these little migrants have that that know lawlessness that's all they know they they they truly believe they're here to rule and they're going to take it out on my kid\nI'm the one who's going to be broken into in my house I'm the one who's going to have graffiti all over their house\nAnd you know this is I think you're exactly right this is going to be a conflict between legal\nAnd illegal immigrants here you go these illegal immigrants what kind of English skills do they have the reports are little to not well what about the legal immigrants that are in this country what is what is preventing them from getting better paying jobs their language skills\nLegal immigrants God Bless ya keep studying your English but their English skills are limited so what do you have you've got a whole bunch of illegal immigrants coming into this country\nAnd they are rivaling and challenging legal immigrants for jobs that don't require fluent English and then\nYou think of as the legal immigrants and just your normal person on the left\nYour going to now have to be in the welfare aligned with these new illegals you're gonna have to go you will go to the same doctors that they do and they're going to get in front of you\nYou are going to suffer the ... it's always the poor it's always the poor who suffered the most because of the crap from Washington and this is nothing more it's more than crap this is an act of war against its own people and of course it will be the poor who take the brunt of it and you could also say the middle class\nI'll I'll gladly add the middle class into that\nUm that category who will suffer the most from it\nYou know it was it was not long ago that the Democrats said they would they went from being against foreign interference in elections to allowing non citizens to vote and that's exactly what they are declaring\nLet the non citizens but we want the non citizens but I had a left wing friend who who was adamant telling me\nDeclaring let the non citizens but we want the non citizens but I had a left wing friend who who was adamant telling me into thousands sixteen there was no illegal immigrants voting in California\nLike hell there were millions of illegal immigrants that were involved not just in California but all over the country that we're interfering lecture you get you do it yet I have to hear about Russian collusion from you\nSo it's time now that the left wing you have seen enough now I I I Can't talk to the legal because they're not even here yet they they will be the people we vote against and the next election\nOkay but now I'm On I'm saying to the to the legal immigrants out there you need to speak up you weren't going to suffer the most and it is time to abandon Nancy Pelosi is time to a bandage Chuck Schumer and the rest of the pigs that are going to steal from you and make your life a living hell\nSo it can make our all of our lives I mean who am I can look at look at this look at this uh I I ... I was reading this I found it very very interesting uh the middle class is disappearing from California's the wealth gap grows do you understand that Democrats rule in California\nAnd they are always said oh we're going to take from the rich and give to the poor\nAnd yet their actions do the exact opposite it dwindled to the middle class\nIt windows it's getting worse and worse and it's going to continue to do so why because you have guys like Jerry Brown in charge you had these left wing idiots that all they care about is their precious elections and they're dirty money that they get from\nCorporate corporations that they say they're against but actually they're taking like Goldman Sachs\nThey're ruled by Goldman Sachs oh we're so against the ... percent oh we're so much against this white privilege but actually they're taking all kinds of dirty money from the worst of them like George Soros who just then\nWhen I when in doubt I'm just going to mail a bomb to myself and blame it on Trump\nThat's where we're at in this country ladies and gentlemen that is where this is so important that you understand the conspiracy that's behind this because it's not going to end\nI said I've been seeing it for three and a half years on the radio now this was going to get worse\nThis is going to get worse they're going to do more of it you're going to see a great awakening however the evil that evil conspiracy is going to pour in a legal to support their operation as the real left wing people who actually have a brain cell wake up\nThat's where we're at in this country\nYou know I credit Trump with I'm making illegal immigration a major issue for discussion and the public forum I remember in the I'm a campaign for the twenty sixteen election immigrant illegal immigration I knew what was there and there was a problem\nI didn't think it was a big problem and I didn't think that there was a conspiracy behind it but you know Trump really made this a central issue in his campaign\nOr their own individual football team that was the thousands of people going into the rally but let's talk about the ones who wanted to protest the protest it was a good thirty or forty of 'em and they were surrounded by police and how we got close hey\nLet's let's go check this out let's go check this they have their banners and their flags holding up and their painted sign snowboarder wall led immigrants in whatever blah blah blah and we get closer and closer and then they and then they're across the street from where the line was and then they start to cross the street towards the Trump people I just honestly I don't know what\nI don't know what got into myself I just felt the need to confront them and to tell them something yes and as they as they were chanting uh I I was there was a wave\nOf non Christianity in me that said you need to really say something fun here you need to enjoy your friday evening while these\nGuys that are in their black masks and there's antifa caps in handkerchief so over their mouth and race they call them start coming across the street so I started going across the street towards them\nAnd while they're chanting their little chance I get right up into one of the little girls the couches college age or whatever I Can't really tell because she was massed and I and I ... I I scream at her\nSix sweetie smaller years a trap\nAnd you're going to love it you're done a lot of it and then I went to the next one and I could tell he didn't like that yes they are like that 'cause their eyes got bigger\nAnd you're going to love it you're done a lot of it and\nThen I went to the next one and I could tell he didn't like that yes they are like that 'cause their eyes got bigger you know that\nTriggered poster that girl from college and she's ... because of it and you can tell it in her eyes they started to get trigger because they're supposed to they're supposed to inject\nFear into ... getting him a date\nAnd we obviously weren't intimidated because then I look behind me and Chris here is doing a little dance to achieve\nYeah he was dancing in front of them like three feet in front of them mocking their shit yeah ladies and the antifa quartet\nFriday night live in Mesa and so Chris does this dance in the meantime I go up behind them and the police didn't like the spy and care [noise] I get up right up behind\nThem and I say six years you\nKnow they didn't like that either in and then they started to feel themselves a little intimidated because then there were a few of us behind them and now they started to feel a little sandwich and the place that serves you can't do that you can't do that\nGo on go on the sidewalk go on the sidewalk and so I started walking as I bump instead of going on the sidewalk ladies and gentlemen\nAnother wave of non Christian fun came upon me and I got right in the middle of the street and I decided to moon them Kiss My white\nWhite privileged rich ass I told them at the top of my lungs I could tell that got triggered in the meantime Chris continues today yes yes\nIt is more fun I've had on a friday\nAnd then I've had in a long time like ... and ... and I dare say to those who listen to the show you have to try it because what did you call it surreal\nSurreal it didn't didn't seem it almost seemed like it was a show or it's staged they would have hair but it it doesn't have like what you see in television typically the wasn't that that kind of hostile type crowd this was more of a belligerent type of crowd they would\nHave liked to go on hostile but the Mesa police was right on top of them yeah they had shot guns ... everything ready for that by police on horseback police and cars\nAnd it was like what about ten or Fifteen to them and then we had what about maybe twenty two protestors right there so it was almost half\nCovering them and then you had another thirty on the other side of the street that were more of the uh run of the mill they were regular just holding up placards and not to mention those of us were actually getting up in their face I'm sure there would have been a trove of\nTrump supporters that we're still in line who would love to have joined us at this got thing got a little rough yes Leon you were a little bit more soft spoken out there but you were kind of part of it to tell tell us what you saw well\nYou know what's interesting when you see these protesters and this is the same thing you saw with the Kavanaugh protesters a with protesters that tried to hone McConnell or other Republican leadership [noise] all they're there to do is just chat just chat just\nOver and over and over again I Know KKK in the usa love not ... I've got\nAll of these slogans down they've got all of this down\nAnd they they're not there to have a conversation with you they're not there to share their views with you there\nThere are just shy chant and showed\nA bullhorn and hopefully get some mainstream media\nTheir views with you there\nThere are just shy chant and showed a bullhorn and hopefully get some mainstream media coverage\nSo that this Trump rally isn't just portrayed on mainstream media as Trump supporters but there's got to be a token group of protesters to show the Trump always stirs up the worst in people we don't approve of his policy ya know right\nRight but they're just mindlessly repeating themselves over and over I mean if you try to get into a conversation with them they're not ready for that ... they're they're not equipped yes they're just going to chat you were shouted down with\nThat of course they're trying to bring about intimidation they want to intimidate you we are coming up against you we\nResist stern says\nYou're not the resistance sweetheart when the corporate corrupt land of make believe or should I say corporate horror pressed to to to set the con media when therefore you you're not the resistance when the one percent of one percent of one percent of one percent when the George Soros ... when the\nYes when the evil corrupt elitist global ... pig [laughter]\nAre you you're not the resistance when\nThe military industrial complex when Monsanto\nWhen uh the educational destined complex the very people putting you hundreds of thousand dollars in debt when you agree with them or not the resistance at all and that is a swift kick in the pants all those who are on the left wing need to learn\nYou are not the resistance you are actually the problem and you're going to continue to be the problem until you wake up now I daresay many ... on the left are waking up\nThey are starting to see this for what it is they're starting to see that the left are going violent and I hope those who are even activists in the left wing movement are seeing that the conservatives are not scared of the matter of fact Chris dances in front of you he actually likes that\nContinue to practice practice and you're a off time\nIt's really good it's really good and some of them some it depends if they get in unison than it was good but yeah I Do that like twenty or thirty that were there near ... everybody was shot and different things so nobody was really in unison so they won't even presenting a United front it just happened to be those four or five\nHappened instruction in the same thing over and over and it it almost sounded like a it's a song of some kind that's why me and this other guy just started dancing the Trump supporter just walking on by throwing insults and they weren't phase what was going on they had to go see the president\nAnd that is how you beat them is when you do not show that you were scared of them that you will go toe to toe with them and that is what completely deflate ...\nIs when they they see that you are actually willing to go up against them because they're in ... when it that's what they are cowards they they wear masks because they're cowards\nEvil is always like that the cockroaches are always like that just turned on the light show 'em yet you're not scared you get right in their face and you say no we're not going to let you do to this country what you want to do and that's when they turn down that's when you can see\nTheir that their their enthusiasm go down you dance right in front of them you're not intimidated all of a sudden our chance are not working our intimidation is not working I daresay their violence is going to they're going to meet their match at some point there's always a bigger fish especially when it comes to fight the bullies do get bullied\nAnd when he runs into that I don't know what it's going to be\nBut when they run into a boy you are going to say no no I don't want because they're cowards at the end of the day\nI don't know what it's going to be but when they run into a boy you are going to see no no I don't want because they're cowards at the end of the day\nYou know I've got a theory on why they wear these masks among other things I think one of the reasons why they were these masks they don't want to be recognized because if they're breaking the law they don't want to be recognized but they also don't want to be recognized\nAt rally after rally after rally the same losers showing up at all the Trump rallies they don't want to make it look like they're just paid participants who hit the road every time Trump has a rally\nThey're the same rules the same losers who have learned the same chance rental and there was this that what was that that little evil man it was just one little disgruntled evil you to go\nBack to sell the land back so land\n... so he wants us to do you understand what Native Americans Indians used to do to each other before they they the less paint this picture like Indians had this utopia\nPeace love and harmony that's all it wasn't smoking federation and smoking are pipe that's all they did all day and we and we danced around the fire that's what they that they lived off the land they lived on my they were used everything and didn't wait oh any with nature and it was just so perfect in wonderful yet you talk to the total
