America's share of dot com America's share of dot com make sure you go there\nGlenn ambulance to the right I'm gonna blow through some of these phone calls on the fourteenth amendment outlook don't get mad at me and if you do I don't care if you guys have found out that I don't care right I'm going to care about you and I care that you listen to me I care that you take the time and they kill you want to get engaged but if you want to just be insulting I don't care that does among\nObviously myself several times have you if you don't get it yet is that it's not really going to be any more one of the very quickly go through these fourteenth amendment dumb phone calls I'm not going to be able to debates with every body let's let's just get down to it you know where I stand on it we all agree that it should be changed it it'd be the the fact that there is a birthright\nCitizenship for anybody and everybody is a problem clearly so let's fix it\nAnd now we have to figure out how we devised a plan to infect fix it we go to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to Eddie and Indiana eddy what's going on\n[noise] yeah Hi I'm doing a good job I agree with you I spent\nAh as far as Halloween goes my kids are Thirteen sixteen we had a great time putting their costumes together\nAnd I'd never tell him that they can't go trick or treating ... how old they are also I was told that when you're a teenager you need to stop I'm not going to be that way and that the other thing about the fourteenth amendment Ari\nAsked this question I Can't get an answer for it when it when when it immigrant as a child in this country she\nDecides to take that child back to her country do\nThat child's being a U.S citizen when that child turns Eighteen can they come back to the United states without a problem yes well that could be a problem\nThere's I mean I I've I've known people I've known people that were born in Texas and before they are even a year old moved away far away to Europe\nAnd then came back as as fourteen Fifteen sixteen year old and they were still fully American citizens absolutely\nWell I think we need to shore this up before it's too late\nAll right sounds good anyway appreciate you open line now eight eight nine four one packs interesting question if you were born here and you have citizenship but when you were born in and everybody does right now I'm you're going to retain that citizenship unless you were an ounce it's somewhere\nUm so yeah I mean for me it's an interesting question but it's pretty simple answer back to a dominant Minnesota dumb what's going on\nYour next taking our car I Want to say that that call you took from the Kansas City guy for eight minutes belongs in the Radio City talk talk talk radio hall of\nFame ... it was a great call I think he did great I I'm I'm\nSerious because your classic devastation how two people can disagree and neither one has a bloody nose yeah and that and you know that's the problem we're at the risk of losing that in the next the future if they don't do something about it\n... ... ... ... you're gonna find this hard to believe but to people who took to Twitter to told me I always rooted that guy to let them talk either so I'm not really I I don't really know what I'm supposed to do\nOh good okay not have them All right [laughter] I got rid of the problem but you know if there was this guy on the from Kansas City was a lefty you would not elastic thirty seconds before a cardio a something hit longer are homophobic whatever right a racist bigger and that's the problem we have\nBecause non rational people cannot engage in a ... and even though they disagree with each other cannot\nCannot tolerate that they're losing this battle it's not it's not so much a loss of conversation or or lots of the argument for them if they're saying hey I mean it's just it's just me are nobody I I have all that when and that's the problem they are having that this culture and we're going to have more of that and that's it but last he'd become speaker unfortunately I'm really scared of that\nWhile I agree with you it is he blows you shouldn't be getting the gamble back but but I Do want to comment on what you're saying I Am willing to have the conversation with anybody of invited left these on my show a million times they never want to come on I in fact are afraid to come on\nAnd it's not about shouting people down it's not about me if I talk louder than you I win that's why I yesterday I had to put the guy on hold because he was getting angry and he's talking loudly\nIt's about actually mixing it up but the way I mix it up and and again maybe people will understand my my dinner table example when I'm sitting at the dinner table with a very large Italian family and we're all having discussion we're in we're interrupting were were laughing\nWe're slapping each other on the face I mean we're we're we're doing what we do to converse together and then by the end of it we say hey\nThat was great and we give each other a hug I think that people think there's a difference a decorum that's supposed to be in place because I'm doing it on the radio there isn't if you say something and I want to interrupt you I'm going to because I'm the I'm the guy who is hosting the conversation and and if I'm interrupting it's for a good reason not to shut you down and say\nOh my God he's making a good point I Want to shut dumb off no you said something that I Want to comment on I think ... so many times and and willing to hear if I'm wrong about this\nBut so many times people call him have a full head of steam they want to say thirty two different points and then expect me to comment on it I Can't I'm not that smart you say two points are going to comment\nYeah any any any doubt I had about being just wanted to argue with an argument has gone right now because you know I it was just such a you know that that was the classic for me and I want to keep listening to you that's all I Want to say before I let you\nGo to John and I my appreciation to add a Minnesota we appreciate dom he's a great listener six days a week or listen to the weekend too and and again I have no problem conceding to point to Joe that the the people that say they have standing may not have standing\nAnd if they do in fact if they are in fact found to have standing they could lose at the Supreme Court level bill when by the way in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals if it gets there but they I think they they have a good chance of losing the Supreme Court and maybe that's the mastery of what the president is trying to do but I don't want\nPresident or any president because look if we say yes\nI'll give me the the Harry Reid example Harry Reid was dumb enough to to go with the nuclear option of fifty one just a simple majority when it comes to deciding things in the Senate he did that because he thought the Democrats would always have the Senate as soon as the Republicans got the Senate they started using the same rule the same thing that he did\nAnd the left these have been complaining and could fetching arguing and yelling and screaming and crying going himself Spartacus ever since\nSo we must be very careful if we really did have a problem with bronco bomber through executive the are changing laws and changing the way this country was founded\nIf we really had that problem let's make sure we're consistent now because President Trump will not be the president forever eventually somebody else is going to be the president and it might even be a Democrat I Hope not but it might be and if it is you want the Democrat Jay prompted it why can't I Do it\nYou can't always switch how you feel about very defined topics because of who's in whatever office it is whether you support\nWe switch how you feel about very defined topics because of who's ... whether you support the person or don't must be consistent I think that's a it's a pretty simple thing to do back at it it's going to be a line one is going to be cited in ah in Houston side which I got about a minute\nAbout how you doing I'm drinking yeah first time I'm going to be a radio show richer Mickey but I just want to say a few things there are few factor that are missing from the conversation sure we're all focusing on\nThe amendment and you know how the babies born here should not be I'm a you know if their parents are legal and all that\nOne factor that'd be neat to kind of look into his also ... is the United states going in terms of its population in the age where I'm most baby boomers are you know retiring you know all of that is coming to an end so if you're going to start treating citizenship it's such a narrow term then aren't we kind of and this is a question or not in a dark\nArt to be kind of restricting upstairs from a A R human capital of the country as they\nOr the other was a it was ...\nOr the other was a it was Jack johnson Johnson yeah one of the fighter\nRight so he was he was stripped of his title and he was excommunicated from society because he dared date white women that was the problem that's why he was charged with a crime and convicted of crimes so the idea that a hundred years later Don Lemon can say the exact opposite and only get away with a B B applauded by the left makes me sick\nBut I heard a number of a share of that I think is is showing that that done lemons and the vast minority subtly this president has a forty percent approval rating with black folks what do you think of that\nYeah well you know people conceive of this nonsense I mean think about that order was sharply the crime for transporting a white woman across state lines that are more ... rice you know that or this country came woman and a guy like Don Lemon returns is back to those times and he just flip the switch we're not saying that about black people but now\nCertain black people you noticed I didn't say all black or or singing about white people no place in our lexicon for that sort of stuff I doubt that Don Lemon has a morals clause because the CNN doesn't have any morals\n[laughter] that's actually a great point if you're probably right it is a share of David Clarke go and follow him on Twitter follow him on Facebook you get all the links right there and his new website America share of dot com make sure you go and take care of that\nKind of a west kind of a flash in the pan I think you called him a shiny objects yesterday one of your tweets that I've retweeted um he he was the news of the day he was ... in the White House in the oval office wearing a make America great again hat and then suddenly yesterday he didn't want anything to do with politics anymore what do you make of that\nYeah he said he was duped is being used\nI'm not surprised um you know I was I I was hoping that you would show more substance I said he's got to do more you and I had this conversation you got to do more than just show up at the White House for lunch you gotta come at ground level do some of the ... or and I said I'm going to wait until he does some of that before a judgment\nBut I Would I Would people about and it's not just with Kanye West and I don't have anything against him when I heard about it with a hammer Rosa and also warned about it with Rosie O'Donnell where people in our side of the conservatives are side we go online and these people because they say something remember Rosie o'donald that I voted for Donald Trump\nAnyone not everyone on our site gone down or a nice to be careful there staking out or TV show\nShe split and ran back the plantation\nStarted laughing conservatives lasting white men blasting president United States I'm almost the same thing\nAnd so or I'm a Kanye West you know I warn I just sold on a second I demonstrate any consistent conservative principles yeah the coolest sounds cool yeah he could be a force for this when I was a little leery so when I saw the story that I saw yesterday I said I'm not surprised\nWell they say in the midst reported first by the way they said that he had a problem with Trump and he actually had to call TMZ and say fix said this isn't about the president not complaining about the president but I don't want to be part of politics I guess share of\nHis issue is that candy is always somehow did something called ... which is black people exiting the Democratic party and\nKanye West didn't want to be attached to it I thought that was his whole month for that you don't have to be a Democrat or a Democrat if you're a black person that you can be open to all sides why would he be against that because it wasn't as ideal own what do you think is the problem\nWell if you noticed that my other ... I said he's got a further clarify that interests me out and gave a real mixed message and and that is problematic for me you know if he wants to change his mind he certainly free to do that and make it clear you can't have one or the ending one without yeah with the IRS by now I I don't think\nTo me you know he wants to change his mind he certainly free to do that make it clear you can't have one or the other one without you know with their peers by now I I don't think he has anything to get president United States I'm not saying that but in terms of this movement that comes with a lot of scarred that comes with a lot of\nUh you know arrows and things in your back does I've been doing this for a very very long time and I know and I said you on your program was this was going to me it's going to get a tax is going to be built by he's going to be your best rated sometimes by black people so\nAnd wasn't ready for it and it turns out he probably wasn't\nYeah but I I I didn't know if he had the uh the stones if you will to adore that sort of thing but I just you know we can do what do you want but he should clarify this because now I'm I'm a little confused\nYes I Am too sharp David Clarke America's sheriff dot com America's sheriff dot com go and read all of his articles can follow them and all of a social media get the book\nCop under fire old great stuff right there at the website make sure you stop by let's let's talk about the fourteenth amendment I don't know if you and I agree let me encapsulate um what I think about the fourteenth amendment the birthright part of the fourteenth amendment I Believe is in there it says I'm going to if you're born or naturalized in this country\nAnd you're subject to the jury jurisdiction there oh you're a citizen people are are confusing the jurisdiction there of to mean for the parents\nI say it means to try once the child born citizen the fourteenth amendment is written horribly I think you and I agree that the birthright for somebody who's bringing you know of coming over illegally and dropping an anchor baby should go away but we have to make it go away by ... by worrying about amendment better be original intent to buy the senator Howard was not for aliens\nNot for for a foreign dignitaries not for anybody who wasn't already as soon as soon or under the jurisdiction there up but they wrote an horribly I think it has to be changed do you think that it has to be changed or do you think the way that\nIt's recorded right now doesn't\nConfirm birthright citizenship to the children\nNo we don't need to change it we don't need to change the constitution some people think the second amendment is poorly written what we need to do is clarified in Congress and the Supreme Court has never ruled on the earth like citizenship\nOf illegal aliens they've never ruled there's been other stream court cases on his ... versus Wilkins I think one of the slaughterhouse and then the other one is the uh the long a gym art which dealt with people permanently residing in the United state run lead us\nLaugh and I ... I think the long cases one bank their hats on because that was from ... to Ninety something and it did say well he's a citizen because and you're saying that that still doesn't go far enough we haven't really ruled on this\nAll right so you know we need to have this discussion a dentist wind up in the Supreme Court and that's okay but there's a misunderstanding I think and I think it's a misinterpretation to think that the way this thing is written means all persons born\nOr in the United states but it said that second part of the second clause and subject to the jurisdiction on here's what that means my understanding short of what the legal concept it\nIt means that you have an allegiance to the United states if you're in the country illegally you don't have an allegiance to the United states you have an allegiance to the nation that you came from so instead\nOr in the United states so the only legal aliens child can say well they could say on the shelves yet he was born in the United states but the second part\nYou have an allegiance to the United states you know the country illegally or he's going to I think focus on that and subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and not going to focus on the born in the United states cause or a you know part of it\nAnd that's all they'll decide but\nUh the fact that the president has made it clear that this is part of the immigration problem by the way is birthright citizenship\nUh the fact is the president has made it clear that this is part of the immigration problem by the way is birthright citizenship universal\nThat's the phrase people using universal Berkeley says writer and exist in the constitution however it leads to shame migration or I\nOr does you know a new and I couldn't agree to that any by the mother has to go back one of the kid is a citizen or not you're going back you broke the law dad can't come grandma can't come Tio India can't come I I agree you and I agree wholeheartedly on that let me just say one one bit about the jurisdiction there of and I'm not as smart as you are in your in your law enforcement guy and I'm willing to\nTo to hear your side and I think we just sent me a lot of sense but the jurisdiction thereof I think applies to the kid as soon as the kid is born let's see he's in Arizona He's in Texas He is in California\nThat child is subject to the jurisdiction there up that she doesn't know allegiance on his parents dies I get that find that parents should get no right to know benefits\nI agree with the child doesn't know legions from this guy or this or that guy doesn't know Mexico Honduras or the United states so if you're on this land\nYou are now subject to the jurisdiction there up the laws of this land where you are will apply to you is what I'm saying about the child and the parents have to go back you and I agree wholeheartedly well\nYeah and I I don't know if I totally agree with that in in in a first of all I Do however the child can they can make that determination as to whether\nThere's some ... drew unless he's waving a little flag when I was born I don't know [laughter]\nTake that child out of the United states anytime they want right in ... as an have any rights and we all we all know that you know why so yeah that's where it gets into that a little better than those in a gray area as to what this means and that's what the role of the courts\nAre traditionally bend to settle this dispute I don't have a ... Supreme Court ruling on this because they have in the past ... back this court has never ruled that a ... an illegal or the child or or in front of an illegal alien or to the United states is automatically as\nWell you are a hundred percent correct they're using ... I'm a principles here I and and and false a story to sizes to pretend like they did rule on this but they in fact in America sheriff dot com America shark dot com sure got about a minute left me a prediction about next Tuesday what's gonna happen is there is still one of energy and still enough\nYou know women vinegar on our side to pull this through\nYeah she was sweet not too long ago I think the the X factor in the next Tuesday it's going to be the blue collar male is the one that's not captured by any old suburban women they're going to be out there on ... involved and all that sort of thing if there's a huge blue collar mail turn out that's what happened in the sixteen year\nOld didn't capture right I think we'll be okay but it's all about turnout\n... and ... to me the Kavanaugh effect still exists although not as ... as it was about a month ago I think that's still going to get people to the polls because they saw truly be unmasked Democrat Party didn't they\nOut of hand magic is doing arson as you are in power are doing and we left wing mob and that\nFor Congress don't get much worse I'm Wendy Rogers Republican for Congress running against Arnold Palmer says it could be the deciding how to print Democrats\nBack in charge of Congress their intent that repeal the Trump tax cuts promised I open borders soccer presidents trained deal just driving economy nine feet tromp impeached Kavanaugh and recreate the rule of law with mob rule relief and ... and\nSome collateral damage\nFrom others who do not care view while healthy it\nCollateral damage what does that mean that mean you lose your job your home and everything you've worked for the Democrats can push the radical agenda on America\nI'm Wendy Rogers I approve this message to urge you to merge straight Republican or we can keep American grain paid for by Wendy Rogers for Congress Wendy Rogers where they\nHave to be boring which is why it killed ... making radio exciting again more Joe packs next on\nOne by one K.

I. C. H. E. L. over on Twitter um is is this are they just guidelines or can you get in serious trouble on campus if you break the flow chart\nThe school actually admit that it doesn't have the power to\nGo after students and to penalize them if they wear a cost him at the school dings races so it's pretty ridiculous but the school posing these things as serious imposes them as these rules that must be followed\nWhen they even admit they admitted to campus reform we're not going to go after students who break the rules so they admit that it's ridiculous and that it can't be enforced because it's not doing anything wrong frankly\nI'm so it's it just shows how the left and basically creating problems so that they can be that wants to offer this illusion\nThat they're trying to um shame people to not being a Mexican taco which doesn't make any sense by the way I'm In San Antonio Texas sixty five percent Hispanic mainly Mexican and ethnicity and of course tacos in Mexico you know if I Want to the radio or television showed\nTacos are not Mexican I Would be in trouble you realize oh ... so let's just dumb or it's it's a ... show she's from give if you're going to ... to their which talked about would produce doing at Michigan State they have uh\nExactly ... so let's just them or it's it's ... am on these shows you forgive if you're going to ... to their which talked about would produce doing at Michigan State that will flow chart would've Princeton doing\nPrinceton has actually released from the student government a checklist for a safe and inclusive Halloween and some of the questions that asks on there are pretty ridiculous an obvious things uh one of them talks about how if you're wearing a costume that makes a joke out of a cultural group then you are racist and you\nShouldn't be wearing costume and it's actually unsafe unsafe by the school and I don't think it's so much the fact that they're saying hey be careful what you're wearing be careful not to wear this costs down I guess the fact that they're actually releasing a checklist so these are printed students we can assume that they're pretty smart students generally um uh yeah well\nWe can argue that point well good of a job for a long time which is going down a few runs in my in my book the\nIt's an Ivy League school so it can at least assume that there is some degree of smart and these students we should at least be able to assume that there is something there it is and yet the school is coming out with these checklist telling students hey make sure that you do X Y Z before you wear homing costume which\nIn general is supposed to be something that's fun and light hearted joke itself so\nI think they're turning things way too serious way too easily and it's pretty unfortunate to see because Halloween so fun it's a fun holiday students should be allowed these students and you know frankly the schools are not giving them the liberty to do that\n... am I Am a ... shows you how did you understand the march ... to ... that we do I do ... ... or ... or ... you're probably move to write this problem to have\nTheir smart people they had to really ... those are the Democrats get into Princeton and then the the the the administration the faculty member at Princeton showed you show stupid or have to tell you not to do that that children would resign and so\nYeah I mean essentially the school is saying hey I Know you work super hard to get here I Know you did well on your SAT's you wrote a really impressive admissions essay but just so you know we don't trust you to wear inappropriate Halloween costumes fish it's I think it\nAs an adult you should be able to make those decisions yourself and if you choose to wear something stupid you will you know you'll be the one to bear the brunt of those social repercussions yeah I don't think it's the school's job to be police saying that and ultimately schools are there to educate students they're there to teach them skills for the workforce I think\nPolicing what's going on Halloween outside of the classroom is really just not what they should be in the business of doing\nCould not agree with you more than ... ... am on the show we went from Michigan to uh to New Jersey and that was due to Utah um what what is the University of Utah do we use it is it different than what we've heard so far\nSlightly but it really fits into the same larger pattern here at the University of Utah held event called my culture is not your costume which is fair enough but I Would think most students could be able to tell the difference between a culture and the cost and when I don't think it's\nThat crazy up a distinction to know already or to try to make so the ah the school is holding these events and actually as a follow up to the event it released a new term which is different from cultural appropriation which is the one that we always hear we've heard it a million times at this point they actually coined a new term\nWhich is cultural co opt Haitian ocean which essentially seems to me the same thing is though that they keep her in they keep reinventing the PC will where they're saying cultural cooperation is when you take something from another culture and you only take that one thing without taking the whole context\nSo the example that they use is a girl who dresses doesn't Indian for Halloween because she thinks that look cool\nTaking the whole context so the example that they use is a girl who dresses doesn't Indian for Halloween doing things that look cool you know they call that cultural ...\nSo story time for you when I was a kid I dressed up as ... for Halloween so I Know I Would be in big trouble if I did that now but as a kid she's an American hero she ... Lewis and Clark\nOr when they were on the trail she help them with navigation finding food she help them stay alive and I'm from Oregon or state may not exist if it weren't for her so she's she's still the hero where I'm from all my friends loved it and my teachers loved it if I were that same costume for the same reason on the college campus today I Would be you were by the left\nFor cultural collapse station or whatever it is they're calling it now it's pretty fortunate see because they do think there are people that Jenny only want to honor other cultures\nBut they're not allowed to do that without being called a racist or without someone screaming cultural appropriation so pretty fortunate the scene because it gets to a point where you are being put into a box and you cannot take things from other cultures outside of your own apartment where is it\nThat was interesting to me is are you the way that it was worded what was his wife we call ... not that that's really a word but it is that\nIf you don't do it in context shoulders hurt me if I decided I'm going to be whatever chief you know shooting ban would ever feel Halloween do I have to have\nWheel of Native American or American indian family members around me which in turn to get away with it what what do you even know what that means that it has to be in contact notice how do you put it in context being shut the door\nWhat's funny is they don't get very much contact the worst claiming that you need to have contact so I can only assume Joe that they would expect you to bulldoze your house and put up a TV and and if you wanted to be sitting bull or you know if I wanted to be second you're way I Would have to walk to work every day instead of driving my car\nUm I I don't really understand why they want a new doing that but well yeah\nIt's it's really don't bother you that you have a hard time explaining it because it's unexplainable but they didn't work what happens\nOn the left is they put as many words you be possibly get in there and Obama was really good at that it would be a question at a at a town hall or in a press coverage and it would give us twenty seven her dissertation as Richard and if you broke it down and really said nothing\nBut merely shuttling words are going to get away with your ... shows you the Brooklyn Bridge or over a year but she found it on the Web sites three about a minute if you don't mind him out on a ... going out\nAnd asking people in college campuses\nUh about the caravan with their thoughts are on the tour of him\nFor the leadership and skip campus reform part of what we do is we send our speakers to college campuses to engage with students and we send them out to make these videos and gauge what the student opinion is on current issues and it's impossible to ignore one of the biggest issue as recently as a caravan of your opt up\nAnd that's coming up through Mexico right now to walk on Mexico\nOn it's pretty interesting to see what students think about this because they say there was one girl that said yeah I\nThink we should let them all in and he said OK well\nIs there anyone we shouldn't let in and she goes oh I don't know maybe Nazis and he's like okay well well how how would we determined that she goes well I don't know maybe it's just\nA risk that will have to take a while I think I think students really don't understand also who's in charge of immigration\nI'm Congress is in charge of you know immigration policy this is not something that Donald Trump should really be blamed for um they they really keep going after the executive branch here they they have all these issues with ice ice doesn't make the rules are jobs just to enforce them roast it would be like going after\nYour local police for enforcing the laws that your local legislators have put into place so I think it's pretty\nIt's thank you I think it's pretty ridiculous to see college students\nUm blaming one person or one administration for these ...\nPlay so pretty it's thank you I think it's pretty ridiculous to the college students um blaming one person or one administration for these problems that had been written for so long in Congress this is a solution that Congress needs to come up with and I think it's really disappointing to see that college students really there's just a lack of understanding that\nIt really it's really an professors to be honest with you because they purposely or either filling their heads with his indoctrinated crap or they're not teaching them you know truly what's going on they don't seem to even understand ships or our government works it's weird\nIt's very true that a lot of students that never actually have to take an American history course we covered awhile back George, Washington university for history major is no longer required American history for the students who are majoring in history so it's pretty dismayed to see I think it's really important\nOr nothing can and just said that good at it than to understand the way our country works so that when you are dissatisfied with their government you know the best course of action to take and I think that most Republicans are pretty well informed on whereas most Democrats are not and if it's upsetting because\nWe see these Democrats to dance and these really liberal left to students they when they don't think they kind
