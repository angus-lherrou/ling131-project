I'm just going to really\nGet always cracks me up which was able to get a call from somebody uh it's it's Carey or Kelly on line to and go hey just wanted to see what I'm doing I was your name will nominate back at it is going to be John in Boca Raton John what's going on high\nI think is very simple law of economics about the same situation yeah\nI was I was a supply of your home depot and all they\nDid is moving in with their big huge stores\nIf you went to Sears you had to go through the nuts and bolts whatever else it's my something at a little bit or write all they do they have every ... and you could you walk in there and you name it it got it forty different sizes so it's better than being on line going right in there and that that's what the biggest rich at our garlic\nBut what is it a negative at Sears is going away or they just didn't keep up with the times\nUh that that's a good question I Would say that it's negative one stores close but Sears just couldn't ... economic battle then on the book Amy and I hope it doesn't happen too much with other stores but it can they've got to take steps to avoid it got to have everything urban buddy\nJohn I hear you I appreciate that poll actually been a very good point during the break um he said well is it because ... years or so late to getting anything on line or what would you say they don't have an apple or something\nYeah I mean I've never seen an ad for them and and then when they're talking about when the last time more than it went in there it was recently but it was because I only have part somewhere and I was just walking through there to get somewhere else I\nBought a riding lawnmower from Sears probably Thirteen fourteen years ago so last time I stepped foot in the store\nSo I get that it's been that long ago I used to be a serious guy go there all the time we thought it was great store\nAnd it and I think so many people are sick and tired of it I mean for the twenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote\nOf color and yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama a I've had all of these white progressive left is shouting at me that I'm not really my ethnicity because of my beliefs\nAnd that to me really is is the real offense here of of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color but they're not people of color while they're bracing stony like Rachel do at all and and Elizabeth Warren\nAnd all through shown to numerous well each Oh yes now\n... um show molten dot com boom to read her blog will you do in the room as you know if you're going to reduce showing your TV where she's doing incredible investigative reporting um I wanted to talk to about ... I didn't know what your attachment was doing ... turns out it was really hard to raise money\nFor this movie it's basically a movie about what it's actually called the wine with America's biggest serial killer I Believe this guy was America's biggest serial killer one show so much trouble to make obviously a very interesting I'm very important story\nWell ah the bottom line is that the a radical abortion is and the Democratic party and on the left\nI Do not want to acknowledge the horrors that are committed in the name of so called reproductive choice and my attachment to the movie into the story goes back to two thousand eleven when almost nobody else was paying attention to the story\nI and I first blogged about the grand jury report 'em in the indictments against ... now who murdered multiple born alive babies as well as being responsible for the death of a woman in in his clinic\nI'm back in in twenty eleven and uh what was stunning about this grand jury report that was issued and you know Democrat liberal Philadelphia or was that they acknowledged that time and time and again government agencies as well as women's advocates looked the other way at the blatant\nCereal crimes that were going on um essentially out in the open and so when an ... and feel I'm ...\nI decided that they were going to first write an investigative book about uh the crimes and then I'll turn them into a movie I volunteered to use\nHelp them and initially they tried to crowdsource the movie on\nA Kickstarter and were kicked off by pro abortion sensors website they had to go to Andy go go and I donated personally three times to the movie and so did many thousands and thousands of other small donors ranting to point three million dollars to get this movie made and it uh\nEnded up in the top ten of movies this weekend despite a campaign to to shut up any kind of publicity for the movie\nAnd again it's ... dot com boom this movie goes no trial of America's biggest serial killer which we all said bravo raising money on Facebook and how about advertising on on the NPR I mean there was a ... everywhere\nEverywhere that trade Facebook up a block them from putting promoted ads on an NPR refused to run an ad that told the truth about\nUh who Cormac God's well now was he was an abortion doctor right and they objected to this plane a description of of who he was and what he was and again it goes back to um all of the grim euphemisms that are used by the left and the media to cover up what actually goes on in these abortion clinics\nIt's been a long time since Jeffrey Dahmer did discussing things he did yeah we still you about him in pop culture in news stories and so on we never hear about this guy at all this guy used used talk the way the media doesn't want to talk about on the left doesn't want to talk about them Planned Parenthood does want to talk about a Muslim purpose right\nIt is it absolutely is that on purpose and that he really should be in that same pantheon of of these most infinite a serial killers who are so many ways glorified 'em by the mainstream media and by Hollywood and\nUm and I think that it I I think with regard to the gods now um I've I've made it very clear about the movie on the book by the way that it is appropriate and safe for um teenagers to see this movie and um it is rated rated PG Thirteen and there's an incredible cast\nA including dean Cain Earl Billings Sarah Jane Morris uh next year see and I'm Andrew clay and who is the screenwriter here an incredibly brave and and bold um film that I Believe is at the intersection of art and investigative journalist\n... do you watch your show on TV also go to a website which ... which is the year on television over the place great political commentator great mind\nYou and I realized because this is we take that we're going to be discriminated against by being re we get that but how's mix usually get away with that Howard Dean Cain take the Jews how did these that because a lot of ...\nAnd his movies I won't act in your movie because if I Will never work again the visually did take some ... didn't\nIt did and you know that I was at the premiere last week in Los Angeles in a theater in Beverly Hills\nAnd you know this is hostile territory for outspoken conservatives and so it made it all the more points to me to be able to meet so many people who worked on the film or who were behind the scenes people who are\nUm you know stage a crew um and and then I met a lot of people who um are you still have are not as a ... in a position to come out about their politics you know they're not established um actors or um filmmakers are director's\nUm but I think that you know as a result of everything that's been happening over the last a year or two years it's really embolden people to to come out who who wouldn't have otherwise spoken out before and that's a good thing\nI Want to deal with those issues movies cause no trial with America's biggest serial killer this is Michelle\nAnd a comment and again watching TV show\nOn TV one last quick question I I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you this heavy into the midterms are gonna think the cabin off that looks really good for our side but we're so far away from the election do you think that conservatives we we take achieved people starting to relax and sit on their on their hands again on an election that we need them to be empowered and get out there and vote\nThat it absolutely right and I and I think that it's not just the Kavanaugh effect but even you know the this latest um peroxide them of mob violence ya\nThat's broken out all across the country the thing is that the left can never help itself and on the heels of even just this past weekend where we had Hillary opening up her mouth and writing as another gift\nUh with her excusing her husband's abuses of power in the Lewinsky scandal right and then on top of that Hillary and bill going on they're corrupt it'll lose a speech\nBefore and now a little bit more in making with an forced airline when they were told earlier you do is sit back and let these people declined well how ... Eric Holder just kick kick us in the face while we're down or something yeah what does not get in a way of themselves [laughter]\nSo I Hope they keep on talking to the next few weeks but it seems I don't want our side to get about what just happened with Kavanaugh because people are sick and even those who are center left or sickened by one Feinstein in the group that\nThat's exactly right and you know a lot of the investigative work I've gone for ... over the last two years has focused on wrongful convictions and particularly false allegations of rape and it has crossed many at a logical lines even though\nA lot of leftist won't talk about it they know what's happened with the burden of proof in America and they know that what happened\nTo Brett Kavanaugh could happen to anyone and so this this this mid term it's not just a a referendum on chops versus not it really is about due process those things we hold dear um and the fact that you know many\nFamilies and parents look at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh I'll look at his daughters and his wife and think to themselves\nI've got to protect my daughters but I also have to protect my son my husband my uncles and my grand\n... exactly right it's ... dot com see her TV show on TV these investigations are amazing by the way Michele thanks for your time today\nYou bet thank you go back after this and the Joe ...\n\n\nShow show\n[laughter]\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy generic mattress built for everyone else you'll asleep built asleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the issues to match your body type and sleep references to the perfect mattress\nWhether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper like a plush or affirmed bed would you look there's no more guessing or confusion\nJust go to ... dot com slash packs\nPigs or two minutes ... they're going to match you do a mattress no we'll give you the best leap of your life you'll get even split the mattress down the middle Ramadi individuals weren't needs and feel preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty\nAnd you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he lives is offering up to a hundred twenty five dollars off all mattress orders get up to a hundred twenty five dollars off at ... dot com slash pegs\nThis month's give local Tucson partner is handy dogs dedicated to helping older adults to people with disabilities to prove their quality of life through specialized training dogs they're looking for volunteer foster homes breeders and donations more details and one of four one K.

strengthen the economy\nHas to do with a new free trade agreement\nA man has to do with um the the ... century staying on healthcare on issue after issue the president is winning and I think at at the at a core level uh his supporters all around the country are enthused by that\nBut and I agree with you and it's not just Kavanaugh it's actually people starting to understand but the left doesn't seem to be running on anything I'm ... and that's really an issue I mean when you're talking about tax cuts to you and I talked about so often\nUm and we talk about you know employers getting more money to give to employees or to hire more people we talk about our economy bet she's our trade imbalance being balanced out\nI don't know what the left really brings to the table to you [noise]\nUm you know I I don't I mean that's why they're attacks have grown frankly more shrill and um you know in in in some cases turned violent um you know one of the things that the left has been talking about of late is health care and I think that's an issue where if you actually look at the facts\nAnd look at the record a UC this president actually delivering a Democrats and that's this began with a President Obama\nPromised that people could keep their plans to their premiums would go down right and that seniors could keep the care that they had known for years and none of those things turn out to be true Renee in fact lived in the country and in fact you're seeing this president come in and with his a regulation cuts to actually\nUm for the first time since the law was put into effect actually cut premiums are under Obamacare is now\nI'm you know cutting these regulations as a lot of people in the individual insurance in group insurance markets to actually pay lower premiums for the first time it takes President Trump to deliver on Brock Obama's promises\nThat somebody is raw show he's a deputy press secretary for the White House um when we talk about about medical we know that we say\nThose making fifty thousand dollars or less\nIf there were eighty percent of those who are paying the taxes with the fines when when they couldn't afford health insurance that went away with the individual mandate going away to people a ton of money but now the left to their story is Medicare for all Raj will be to help me understand how we're coming up with thirty two trillion dollars to pay for Medicare for all\nWell Joe your guess is as good as mine but it sounds like it's going to come for your from your uh your listeners pocket ... look um\nThat the Democrats and this starts from Bernie Sanders on down but every every idea that he had only a few years ago seems to be mainstream now in the Democratic party is eight thirty two trillion dollar proposal\nTo take away private insurance essentially make it not essentially what am I saying it is actually to make it illegal to have a private health insurance plan and have government bureaucrats who run the post office uh and and many of the other failing agencies\nAre around around the country had them essentially set up a national health service I'm reading it's dangerous for your health care it's dangerous for um you know for private health insurance and for seniors have particular particular it's it's dangerous and if you actually look\nAt the model that has been created a lot of people a point to medicate ...
