folks are in putting together their menus and actually putting their artistry at the center of the plate and kicking things off on this show today some people call him a two sons favorite purveyor of poultry he's from tough not foreign and it's\nLike um you know what Michael how are you sir\nI'm Matt how are you tonight it's great to talk to you I'm so excited to talk to you and like this is a busy day you've got hundreds of chickens\nThat are being prepared or just for me are down at the coyote for tonight that's right they almost didn't let me leave the farm either way out of that [laughter] so what is it about top not from look I I get the privilege Michael ... hard to talk to so many shops around town and I\nHave lost count man how many chefs say I want to use local poultry and when I'm thinking about local poetry I Want to work with top not farms and only top not farms why do you think that is man\nYeah um well I think that first of all we offer a very special product um there's nobody in southern Arizona it's doing exactly what we're doing and um there are a handful of incredible restaurants in Tucson and Phoenix that ah\nUnderstand what we're trying to do and they have the clientele they have the customers that go to the restaurant um they're looking for are unique item like past raise poetry dot quail chicken okay so ... so you have ducks\nQuails chickens Gees pheasants\nComing up on turkey things right what a poetry to keep your eye on yeah we do it all anything with brothers will grow up\nGees pheasants coming up on turkey things right what a poetry to keep\nYour eye on yeah we do it all anything with brothers will grow grow grow good birds whatever tastes good\nSo you say people are are are wanting to work with you because they like what you were trying to do what what are you trying to do it like okay look chicken chicken right\nI mean a chicken if I'm if I'm going to roll up my sleeves and tear into some great chicken am I going to be able to tell the difference between something that was raised out in the past or eating bugs and and and such a as compared to a chicken that let's just say a dozen didn't have that level of luxury and it's a very brief amount of time on the planet sure absolutely\nWell we think that there's something special about what we're doing because I'm the birds that we grow live a natural life they're outside um they get rain they get sunshine that get grass\nSeeds bugs um and we think that all that extra a greatness at the birds get carry through in the flavor of the meat and I'm produces healthier bird um and we think that we have a great alternative to commercially grown poultry on a healthy bird is happy bird yeah absolutely\nAnd you want your bird happy absolutely that moments or that leads ... leads the bird to the processing room or because respect for the protein is such an important part of the story as well right\nSure absolutely we give our birds a great uh life they have a lot of great days with us and then just one really bad day [noise] [laughter]\nWell there are bad day is my great day especially when I'm ... not ... how many chickens do you have right now running around in the farm\nYeah that's a great question so on a farm right now we have uh about twenty five hundred birds in various stages of life everything from from Dale checks to birds that are ready to uh be harvested\nAnd how do you know when that moment is right I mean you off the males is pretty precisely when it comes time for that chicken to say you know in reading I'm ready to serve I'm ready to be served up when do you know the moment is right\nSure um well we look at weight um that's the target that we're going for we can look at a burden\nAnd I have a pretty good idea of what it's going to clean up\nThe way that it will dress out at um but yeah we're looking at feathers looking at the way the bird walks um it's pretty easy to lay the bird why it sounds funny it's a it's kind of silly but you can tell by the the gate that a bird has how much weight as caring and\nUm so yeah there's some tricks like that where your farm our farm is forty five minutes east of Tucson outside of the town of ... in Arizona\nAnd you're doing you're raising the poultry you are harvesting the poultry right you are processing the poultry right there at the foreign which I understand is

fresh or\nYou know summertime cuisine ended a cooler climate what does fall how does fall challenged the back of the house and putting a menu together\nSo one of my favorite dishes on the new menu is a mosquito shorter\nSo what they do is that going um Braves a short rip ... wild mushrooms from all over Arizona is and then what they do last minute they go ahead and get some smoke um Muskie chips\nAnd to a smoker cover a dome over smoke it right there before they run the table put a dome over and as you're walking into table it's just smoking that shorter at the Weill modern rooms that aren't as you walk to the table pull that dome off and you just get that mosquito flavor just throughout the entire\nRest now they're not doing that at the at the Lowes in Detroit you know and I don't know if there is a Lowe's and to drive up to ... again that isn't that they at capturing moments a ... in time it says this is what we do in Tucson so don't smoke literally just a ...\nView of the Roma throughout the restaurant nice cold night and you just get that mosquitoes smoke flavor the smoke coming out the warm this from the average the dish is just what that's what makes this restaurant in the wintertime\nSo that's one of the new dishes on new when did you guys dropped them at the new menu last night [laughter] and then this radio guy comes here uh and runs his mouth so had an opening night opening\nOne great yeah we have great business great feedback from our locals are hotel guess everyone loved the new menu what are some of the other things that said that you have on the

is continuing to tell the story about what the season looks and smells\nA uh like at the center of the play exactly and then some of the drinks are just the same way drinks yeah\nUsually I drink filtering ...\nLike you said you start with them I let's get and what do we got has shaken and started buying them are\nOne of my favorites is going to be a hunting trip it's a play on like apple

growth in the local spirits seen I mean look we can talk about local brewers for another whole hour of that because that has just been an explosion but spirits are not far behind them and I think they are like four or five ... you know distillers here just in southern Arizona\nIt's amazing how much they're popping up all over the place I'm looking forward to bringing as much as I can over the next couple of years\nBut right now they just need to grow up get the distributors in and prove themselves I mean right now ... is leading the way I mean come on without them there would be no

Lawrence on the show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Thursday\nNight and on the phone with me right now is Andy McCarthy Andy I Love having you on because of your debt the knowledge as the prosecutor put the blind shaken prison you know the federal law and I and I we also appreciate the grand jihad how Islam in the lab sabotage America or you can find a way to end the rights of National Review but Andy\nI'm going to get your take on on where\nUh what do you think is driving this bombing attempt if we can call it that none of the bombs went off but they were devices sent to a total of ten different addresses now and uh and use this as you wrote today an example of why no one trusts the media in America\n[noise] well I think was that the abandon with which the media\nGot out in front of what we know about\nThe sensitive which so far is not a whole lot\nUm it was really staggering to me I mean the the the trends parrots determination to try to make this about Trump and even kind of vaguely or not so vaguely suggest that Trump\nA sort of inside it this or that his rhetoric um it is so unique and uniquely bad for the country that it might have driven somebody to do this is just really a\nMind boggling I'll have a piece coming out on a column coming out on National Review about this\nTonight but you know just when you when you move out of the world of political uh talking points and narrative and soap opera like we deal with and get into the real world of like prosecutions on the court room and a jury common people's common sense\nI'm most normal people understand that nobody\nGoes out and commit mass murder attacks on the basis of anything they hear it a political rally no matter how obnoxious or odious it may be and it really trivializes this kind of terrorists behavior\nTo suggest that it's driven by or something along those lines it's just foolish\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make to say if all of the ...\nOr something along those lines it's just foolish\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make to say you have all of the bombs were sent to people who were you know in one way or another politically oriented toward the left from George Soros to Maxine Waters to the Clinton the Obamas and to CNN\nI guess it's not a far jump to say well maybe it is politically oriented whereas if it had just been random targets\nAre kinda like uh the the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski than you might say well we we don't know what's driving him except that apparently hates technology\nYeah well I I'm not at all hesitant about that last I think that we're now\nAt a ripe enough points in what's been learned about the investigation that we can clearly said as a political motivation here yeah um but we would be able to say that whether Donald Trump was president or not and whether he had ever had a single rally or not my my faith\nIs not that you draw a conclusion that some things politically motivated when it obviously is my complaint is that you suggest is the president's guilty of incitement Yup I happen to be one of the few people in America is actually a convicted people or at least one person of incitement\nIn court and I can tell you that it's a very difficult proof in the courtroom as it should be\nBecause we have a strong tradition in this country of of free speech particularly political speech\nUm but you know court ruled proof aside it's just it's it's simply common sense nobody goes to a political rally regardless of how skilled the dead like a boss\nOr you know some other skills speaker at a rally may be and even if that person gets the the the crowd riled up\nAnd they say yeah I'm I'm really angry about what those people are doing to us and doing to our country nobody leaves from that to say and because of that I'm going to go now to commit mass murder attacked well and maybe they'll decide to go where the doorbell or something but they're not going to go out and it showed up some or you know a\nBomb people into a into oblivion oh well\nThere there might even be people who say I went out and punch somebody in the face because I was so far to the political rally but then when you try to turn around and say and it's not my fault I didn't actually cause it the person who riled up cause did\nThat CNN buying into a a kind of I'm not responsible for anything gets to the guy who was talking to me and saying words to me who inspired me to do that and I look I anti I've covered some cases they uh\nUh what was a wide area and resistance case where a\nTom ... a inspired people to go out and and be demand adept with baseball bats because he was black\nUh I I Would buy that you you might be able to do that but as you said it's a very specific case where you say you had to say I'm going to tell these people to go and commit these acts because of their angry over somebody's skin color and and they did prove it in that case I Believe and I don't I think that ... that held up on appeal\nBut was CNN as you say all these other news sources saying all of this stuff is Donald Trump's fault\nTwo days after the New York times published a uh uh uh some assassination pornography in the form of a story about the assassination of Donald Trump and then there are calling for unity in and closing the the the divisions between has its its rank ... I ...\nYeah I look I I completely agree with that they look lost it there's a doctrine of law called fighting words ... uh which is an exception to the first amendment\nThe last ... there's a doctrine of law called fighting words mhm uh which is an exception to the first amendment\nUh it's it's over the years been cut back on an awful lot says the Supreme Court recognized it in Nineteen forty two and there's a lot of good constitutional law experts who think that it's a completely moribund\nA doctrine but what it basically held was that if I say something insulting and insightful to you in your presence\nAnd you you know turn around and uh and and clocked me of on account of it um you know I had a minimal expectation of First Amendment protection because I insulted you and I kind of went looking for now again as I say\nI'm the doctor it has been cut back on a lot in recent decades but it's never been the case that that extended to you know you attend a political rally and that you are you know you go away from the rally and you have some distance\nIn terms of time and space to think about it and then you go out and commit an atrocious act and we say it's still it's the fault of the person who's rally you went to that simply it it essentially says that you have no agency for your own behavior well yeah just ridiculous\nWell Andy I I you know I'm the non lawyer near the lawyer but\nI've read that case a you know years ago because I I thought this is interesting if you walk into a bar and say something so vile to a man about his girlfriend or his wife that it could be the verbal equivalent of a punch in ... in the nose and you might arguably say for something that bad you might you might get away with punching him back for his words but\nBut I think it's a stretch and as you say blaming it on the president or any other politician\nBut I Will tell you that I think I've heard more things coming out of the mouths of Democrats like Eric Holder Maxine Waters Hillary Clinton you know and some other allies like Madonna fantasizing about blowing up the White House\nThat if they want to start going out in identifying people who said let's go out and do violence because of this presidency you're going to find a lot more offenders on the left a than you are on the right the right tends to be pretty\nDon't law abiding I think mostly conservatives are but where do you think there's going to go we got about a minute left in this interview and\nI think they're going to capture the the person or persons behind this pretty quickly large there's an awful lot of forensic evidence that they have and unlike when I investigated these cases Twenty years ago video is now ubiquitous so I I Would think they'll they'll capture this guy in very short order\nShould be interesting because it's awfully tough to route rap those\nPackages in tape without leaving your fingerprints in your DNA all over it and of course having a courier deliver them I'm kind of amazed that through the courier service they haven't found something almost immediately I doubt he paid for with a credit card or a track\nGay marriage has been imposed on fifty states by the Supreme Court and people are talking about polygamous marriage being being allowed by the courts about religious liberty we used to think that was fundamental\nNow you've got you've got Christian businesses getting sued into bankruptcy 'cause they won't take part in same sex marriages\nFree political speech the left used to be for that\nNow if what you say make someone feel unsafe the government can step in and arrest you for it and finally how about the idea of academia seeking objective truth and letting a free range of opinions you know be on campus even if it hurts people's feelings because that's how we find the truth\nNow they're they're silencing free speech on campus on all those things the left walked away from the American consensus and embraced extremist views and now they're screaming at us for being fanatics because we still believe what we did when Ronald Reagan and\nGeorge Bush and Bob Dole and Bill Clinton that Harry Reid all agreed on all these things we didn't walk away they did\nAnd they believed to now let me ask you something since you and I are on the same jogging on just about everything Everytime I've talked to John I'm Talking to John ... from the stream and you're going to reduce he's written\nUm if we were to draw just as hard as you and I could could we come up with any kind of similar ... the list\nOr something like it I Know you I don't believe in the artificial moral equivalency were once lift off the folds both sides but if you tried to find that he was there anything that the right has walked away from where it was on the same page as the left Thirty years ago\nI Can't think of a single thing honestly\nNow I Know what I'm thinking of single thing when we were not calling for America to be a monarchy or a Christian government we're not calling for people will be put in internment camps\nWere not calling for ... racial supremacy we're not doing any of the crock pot things that they're accusing us of they're they're just redefining what the American consensus was in Nineteen Ninety six as a patriarchal\nIf the crackpot things that they're accusing us of there they were just redefining what the American consensus was in Nineteen Ninety six as a patriarchal white supremacist evil heterosexual heterosexuals patriarchy patriarchal monstrosity so the laugh to move the goalpost out of the stadium\nAnd they're calling us lunatics 'cause we're still in the fifty yard line\nNow do you think that some of this the divisions caused by one side walking away from the consensus points\nIs what's causing all of this turmoil lately violence in the streets bombs sent to a bunch of\nOf liberals a political liberals and we don't know how many more may be on the way as are delivered in the mail do you think some of that is because we're we're putting Americans in ... in a position where the two major political forces in the country\nUh one has walked away from the table in those dozen or so items and and that leads people wondering well then what am I supposed to do a riot when they're no longer consensus\nAlso another item of consensus is when you lose an election you accept it yeah\nBut but the left didn't accept that Obama is\nAnd I know the two thousand eight was supposed to be a permanent fundamental transformation of the country that the election twenty sixteen\nThat was supposed to be a formality like election in East Germany where you just certify with the party has given you when the American people said no we won't take Hillary the Leslie outraged this was supposed to be a permanent irreversible revolution under Obama so they really think\nThat they're under foreign occupation by foreign enemies that's why they have to have a resistance resistance is what you're doing the Nazis occupy your country not win Ohio votes against you\nWell and I know this and when I was a little kid and you weren't even born John but when Nixon you know said okay I'll concede the race\nThere were folks who said no don't we could fight over this winter we could win this one you know because there was probably cheating on both sides there was certainly treating on the Democratic side he said for the good of the country I'll do that I think that's what the left thought was going to happen in two thousand with Gore and Bush\nAnd they failed and that drove them crazy and lately that that sort of\nWe're going to rush the barricades and they'll they'll simply open the doors for has happened with Kavanaugh when they said well we're going to throw all this stuff down they'll cave in and Republicans have finally grown a spine and said no we're not doing the cave in thing anymore and get over it and I think the Democrats realize\nThis is not going to bode well in the years ahead in probably not two weeks from now either\nThat's right that's right and and I hope all your listeners are going to vote in the national impeachment referendum on November ... because that's what it is\nThat is really what it is because we ended up with a a Democrat controlled house not even the sun and you know they'll go ahead and tried to impeach Trump even though they don't know that they would get a conviction in the Senate they'll do address is just so they could say they ... they can do it and say you\nGot one of ... Kavanaugh and the whole cabinet and probably Mike Pence they're going to be complete obstruction is our government or the process of government will come to a halt and we'll be some third world banana republic in chaos for two solid years\nUnfortunately you've got to read this ...

you're asking a so lately for asylum seems kind of ironic\nThey must be left these young you know fill that left these have no sense of irony whatsoever\nNot our reserves are bringing out our military is could be a big episode in American history if things keep growing where they're going and the Democrats they love it because they're the party of chaos and conflict and and if you're not American there on your side of your American they're pretty much not on your side\nYou vote for them they'll tell you that they're on your side but they're lying to you know the president of Guatemala it was a guy named Jimmy was named Jimmy hey Jimmy how what's happening what's going on in Guatemala brother Jimmy Morales says the president of ...\nAnd the president of Guatemala last Thursday said that his security forces have captured almost one hundred ISIS terrorists in Guatemala that's what he said\nPresident said it's been a stretcher had captured quote close to one hundred people completely linked to terrorist issues with ISIS and that not only have we arrested them within our territory\nBut they have been deported to their countries of origin and Guatemala don't deport dress in a heartbeat [laughter]\nSo should we have the same immigration policies that Guatemala I have I think perhaps we should President Trump so he's out of prison Trump also mentioned I'm a possible is one of those

with me in it at a in my building and my neighborhood forget about it and and I and that's great I think that's wonderful\nBut we have immigration laws we have a system for immigration and it isn't let's get thousands of people with foreign flags in March up and we have a list of demands because that's not going to work you know we might have to let the Democrats loose on 'em with fire hoses and dogs\nAre they they they don't do that anymore or they just do that when somebody wants to exercise their right to free speech things like that Fox News center reporter William ... ness down to the border between may ... go walk them a lot of Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world\nHonduras has the highest homicide rate in the world outside the door\nHas the fourth highest murder rate in the world go off my law has the I'd I'd do that kind of like cut showed um has the fifth highest homicide rate in the world you should probably um work on that\nShould see what you can do about that to decrease the homicide rate\nJust in Tallahassee also you know Gillum is his name right the Democrat running for a Senate in or for governor rather in uh in Florida\nAnd um hid under his watch under his two tillage under his leadership Tallahassee now has a the highest murder rates\nIn the states and they've they've shattered the record for\nFor Tallahassee um and and I guess that's a point of pride or something I'm ... but if you're a Democrat it's not really a big story I suppose because\nYou get promoted it's like round the manual it's like Brock Obama bronco Obama organized the south side of Chicago good job there and I was elected to the Senate from the state house the U.S Senate from the state house in Illinois and then the president the United states because he fixed the south side of Chicago which is like Aleppo\nRight what's Aleppo or let's go to William ... done along the border and um it it's true though this Gillum guy at the the homicide rate in Tallahassee has\nShattered all records and that's not even something that reflects on him at all\nWhy why would that be a problem\nIf you're a Democrat it's really not a problem All right let's go because ah William washing us with Fox News yesterday I was watching this live yesterday afternoon and William ... was speaking to one of the organizers of the caravan [noise] his name\nHe said was Luis and Louis was wearing a vest like he's a crossing guard you know as with the reflective orange\nStuff on the vest and\nWilliam washing us bugged him because he was at a designated as a spokesmen and one of the organizers of the thing and I said what you know when\nFor him because he was at a designated as a spokesmen and one of the organizers of the thing and I said what you know when these people get to the United states what what did these people want why are they fleeing their homes in Central America what are these people going to say when they get the United states\nThey probably will say something I don't know they were probably ask [noise] they they gave him something while they can't say I have for the kids have can go to school so they can't apartment and they can go to work\nSo they can get but there there are kids aren't with them so they want to bring their kids in after they get here because it's mostly adult men\nThat are that are coming in but I didn't hear him say anything about a living in fear about uh the crime the gangs or their current tells I didn't hear anything about that it probably has to give them something\nSo they can have stuff so they can stay so they can get an apartment so they can get a job so their kids can go to school\nYeah\nAll right well okay I understand that I I genuinely do I understand that\nAnd for that we have something that we called the immigration system and you go to the embassy in your country and you apply and you know not let me let me ask this of any halfway to live out their let's say somebody gets on an airplane in Aleppo\nAnd flies to Cairo and then flies to London and then flies to New York and gets off the plane and says I'm here to stay I Want to live here I I I got on a plane and I came to the United states because now I'm here and I'm not leaving\nIs that how our immigration system works is that our immigration system should work is that how the immigration system of any country works or should work\nThe answer is obviously know Luis\nWas asked by William large enough they said well look the president said he's going to ah\nHe's going to shut down the border as you\nBring this caravan up toward the United states the president said he may call it the military and he's going to shut down the border but listen Louis knows she paid attention last time around the Democrats ginned up that whole fake news story completely fake huge lie that's like the red solo cups story\nThat Trump\nBecause of a zero tolerance policy in a part of that was true separating families like never before none of that was true Obama separated them all the pictures that they use word from the Obama administration\nBut listen Louis learn and then because of the media slash Democrat but I repeat myself pressure or the president was forced to basically let the caravan and they were processed\nThey were let loose in the country catch and release because the Democrats were and their allies and the media were able to manipulate public opinion with fake pictures they're real pictures but they were from Obama putting children in cages then Obama literally did turn people over to caregivers\nSome of whom used them as slave labor including sex slave\nLabor children handed over by Obama personally\nJust getting it wasn't personally but it was his administration if it were Trump handing kids over to people that use them as slaves on a chicken ranch in Ohio which is what happened during Obama with kids living in a in a chicken shack with a bucket as a bathroom\nBecause the Obama people handed him over to the flavors\nAnd they were literally slave labor in Ohio\nWell handed him over to the flavors and there are literally slave labor\nIn Ohio the children that were handed over by Obama and that story just got nothing\nNothing because I don't care about children and don't care about human life they don't care about slavery and our care about the sexual abuse of children and their documented cases of the Obama people handing children over\nTo people who are not their guardians who than uh the cereal a sexually abused them but you know let's not get all caught up in that so Louis was watching the news and he knows last time around President Trump said he wasn't going to let them in but then they got him so what did Lewis said yesterday\nThat I found a lot less time and we we take over there but he opened the border for them all and then people will say voter Neal radio in the United states\nOut of Guatemala for some time now about a hundred of them why would that be a problem\nCan see why that would be an issue at all\nUh and maybe we should send Bradley Manning too and we should", "show_name": "James T.
