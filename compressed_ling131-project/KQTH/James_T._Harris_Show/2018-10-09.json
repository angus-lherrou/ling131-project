for one the first time I've called and I'm sort of glad you took my call okay what's happening well every time\nYou and other people in the media used the word you teach your use you hit it correctly\nI I don't know I use it incorrectly\nOkay impeach wasted\nCharge right is derived from the Latin term catch or in a tangle\nRight which is what I've always said we had that I use it wrong\nWell they're going to go into a speech the president or the right way to teach right you've you've left out the the whole process of ... that you\nKnow I haven't ... I don't think you've been listening very well and to go through what I Know and what I've always said and then you can correct the other media members have you on and I definitely want you to talk about it when you're making a really bad assumption here when I said is the Democrats are running on the idea that if they get the house of representatives back they will impeach the president impeachment doesn't mean remove\nBill Clinton was impeached he but he wasn't convicted impeachment is you bring articles of impeachment you alleged that they somehow\nData crime of of of impeachable substance which would be high crimes and misdemeanors you bring those articles of impeachment in the house of representatives if the Democrats won the house they'd be able to do that then they would send it to the Senate and the Senate because it's still dominated by Republicans you know have a sixty seven member majority that would ever convict\nThan uh the guy wouldn't be removed it would go away they would do this only the mock things up I Know exactly what impeachment is but you sound like you're very knowledgeable guy maybe you could say it in a better way than I just did and I love for my listeners to hear it but please don't make an assumption that I've been I'm using it wrong good\n\nWell I Am wrong if if it's exactly how you you'd be portraying\nOil yeah I've always said it that way always\nOkay in the solar court for impeachment trials is the United States Senate yeah and the chief justice of the United States Supreme court presides over the trial guy in a super majority of two thirds of the senators has to vote to convict\nYeah you'd have to have sixty seven as I said\nRight and Andrew Johnson was the first president to be at each ... each one by one vote and then Bill Clinton was in each that I had no idea what the\nYellow vinyl vote tally on on that either but we did talk to can store a few weeks ago here and he was he was impeached he was actually ... and I and I asked Ken Starr was it because he lied under oath you said all that plus the structure of justice but more importantly it was um\nAbusive power was the main reason why a Bill Clinton was impeached and you're right it went to the Senate he was found not guilty\nCorrect and ... are the charges are true\nNothing there and on on Kavanaugh I have no idea what they think they have other than potentially perjury um in his testimony which can't be proven because I don't know how you go back to Nineteen eighty one to find out who's telling the truth or not\nOkay you're going to get a pass on this is what I Do I ... I didn't know don't don't do say though it's perfectly fine it's actually understandable\nWhy you would assume that everybody in the media is doing the same thing because the vast majority of Americans John and I think you know this and it's why you called in they think when you say you impeached means removed\nAnd it doesn't mean that at all which is just it's just started the process in the house that ends up in the Senate and it's very very hard to impeach somebody and if the Republicans still have a majority in the Senate and they probably will after November it's going to go nowhere\nBut I'm not really sure why the Democrats think running on that let me ask you this because you sound like a smart dude and I think you probably have a good answer to this do you think the Democrats are running on impeachment because most people think it means remove\nWell yes I Do I think the I think that Democrats do because I don't think they're smart enough to read history books or Google or the beach\nBut [laughter] [noise] British probably true ah it's as simple as to Google to get it and they just haven't done it\nRight but uh\nAnd and this gives or for worse for the the the the Republicans to go out there and really fire up the vote\nSo we make sure that we have the majority in the house of representatives and we have a majority in the Senate\nSo you know this this hopefully will light a fire or Paul Ryan was at its McConnell and we'll see what our butts out there to go out there or start campaigning for the ... the Republicans that are running for office\nJohn I hear you and I appreciate your brother that I Do appreciate you wanted to educate but which are you know I'm a little sensitive like that I Want to make sure that I'm right but more and more than anything yeah so you're going to say I'm wrong make sure that you show me how Iran are backing up mhm\nExactly right it's not that hard All right John we appreciate your age eight nine four one pegs editing nine for one Seventy two four seven are they still they still do the dog and pony show in Washington\n... do not know I had a TV right now so I\nMet face these students can have a TV on an ... logo was on the team hello yeah I'm like wait a minute we're at which is exactly how it should be it would it be get rid of that I get a loan to them all those things for you and these reports all we know\nThat I'm just kidding it's awesome rude freebie\nAnd edited nine for one pack Joe packs dot com let's go to um jak in Boston jak what's on your mind high\nA face that's taking my call I appreciate it you know I Want to say is that good at it could be an American I was very ... said I only a justice cabin on yes a concern but also want any ad that democracy is alive and well I Would also make his protection jail if I may yeah\nIt's all the candidates while maintaining a majority in the Senate and they ... and the guy in the house as well\nI think the house is going to be harder or jak but I mean there's there's three or four weeks of cabinet so I think that a lot of Republicans are going to be motivated to go and vote\nI Hope they don't forget I have a very short memory\nOr whether you're no Jack Jack I appreciate you thank you were living on a Boston what's interesting is I think he's right\nIt's almost unfortunate that this all went down a month before the election you know what I mean if it goes down two days before the election everybody's going to go and vote screw this am I going to deal with us again left right meal whatever the hell you are you going to vote because it just wasn't right which is went down\nIt just wasn't right but now that it's a month out and editing\nYou are you going to vote because he just wasn't right which is way down\nIt just wasn't right but now that it's a month out and get\nLook I'm not going to give the Democrat talking points I might look ... do you want to do what they're doing because really dumb but I mean they have a month now to fix all of what they just harm and they just did a lot of harm to this country to our system we they ... they would generally said\nThey literally said it does it matter at this point of view citizen or guilty about\nSpartacus actually said due process doesn't matter period and their story of a nice day\nEight nine four one package Joe ... we go back it's got to be um former governor of the great state of Alaska former vice presidential nominee for the United states of America she was on the ticket with John McCain and Sarah Palin listens to this program\nAh every day as you drop the kids off at school or picking them up and are we really are we enjoyed climbing up and she likes to show on friday and I and join even more having a conversation with a not very long ago you're going to see it on television going to hear it on radio and uh yes I Do ask you are very directly are you planning on taking a Lisa Murkowski\nAnd then I voted for you so and I think a lot of people actually did that the enemy friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um the law issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast\nIn other words if the Supreme Court is eight members that it's tied for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment tenth amendment for Alaska where does that make you think\nThat that's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that they're um what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right you know about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh than they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very person very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why\nWe don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for at least to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous another thing is that\nTrump President Trump saw the light and is allowing Al Gore only decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has in terms of resources to help our country become more\nEnergy independent that inherently between energy and security energy and prosperity that's at our that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere\nThat Lisa would put that in jeopardy and gave that to her he gave that to her Alaskans but it was through her and for I mean that was a\nReal nice thank you ... ... ...\n... it just it just doesn't make any sense of Sarah Palin of course you know Sarah Palin um I I gotta jump on that we are reliant on people in the middle East that don't necessarily like us\nWhy not going to and from what some of the geologists have said it's two hundred years were the ... and ... why wouldn't we going to become self reliant and turn this big it off to these bad guys and by the way Lisa Murkowski voted no I Want everybody watching and listening especially those of you in Alaska\nShe voted no on Kavanaugh officially it's in a prison vote because later she changed it for danger was going back to his daughter's wedding so she said I'm just going to vote president disorder counterbalance what his vote would have been\nBut she on the record in the first round said no\nLiteral absolutely so that's that's typical political ... that's a typical politician wanting to kind of play both sides if she truly had a problem with Kavanaugh\nBeing on the bench and she said he's not the right man for the bench then she her boat then at the final vote what reflected that instead of saying oh well I Do this because it's not really count any way I really believe something if you have that talk with pointing due north\nKnowing what the right thing is to do then you fight for that\nBut instead very wishy washy and should learn you know ... in the middle of the road get hit on both sides directly\nWrites Sarah building a former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party two thousand eight\nThe middle of the roads get hit on both sides directly\nWrites Sarah building a former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party to vote was also the governor's race state of Alaska a great person and I love the we're having this conversation\nOr you're going to take a wrong because your tweet might have been the best we are there were seen this entire year it was a Lisa Murkowski I can see twenty twenty two from my house\nTalk right is that going to happen\nYou know the only thing that keeping me from just being close to the wall enthusiastic about the idea is twenty twenty two so far away that that I mean that's almost frustrating looking that far\nBut for some like me who's always preaching to people stand up make a difference the gifts and talents and opportunities God's created for you and\nThe different well you know I Can't just keep preaching it and not jumping and also at some point one of these position I Would so desire serving of this country and we'll see where that goes before I forget what we're talking about the second amendment on which\nJudge Kavanaugh is he's he's absolutely pro constitution writing their Second Amendment Lisa hesitating Leigh voted for President Obama's tax on different judicial\nPositions including getting there on the DC circuit she's pro abortion totally anti gun anti commonsense constitutional is is she and we had no problem at all\nSo she can to to um exercise that you vote 'em up and down it was always up\nFor Obama's picks but wouldn't give that same respect and I think consideration for a good man like cabin on another problem that leaves the house and the Trump has is that\nWe had many never Trump or his around her where I was in their approach and um she's hired a lot of never Trump first then has hired a lot of never Trump ... and some of these folks you know we keep warning him about you can't win them over there going to continue to undermine and that's quite unfortunate for the ... movement\nBut why do we work has given are under her name is just to get the votes in Alaska hoping that people won't pay attention to the record what you just said just now in the past minute would tell me I can never vote for\nYeah a ... and that is why yeah that are by the name I mean that's it's a consummate right oh\nYeah absolutely right it ... the former vice presidential nominee and also the former governor the retreat of Alaska certain the moment I have left I I Would be remiss if I didn't go back to how you and your family were treated by the media when you were announced it and I imagine either some days in my life\nThat were really great also tell my family I just succeeded in doing something I could imagine when you told John McCain want you to be the vice presidential nominee almost like Brett Kavanaugh being told\nDonald Trump want you to be on the Supreme Court it's gotta be jubilation it's got to be unbelievable Julian at high fives and belly bumps and and much left\nAnd then all of a sudden the media says we're going to get her mission and\nDozens and dozens of people to find anything they possibly can on you simply did was Kevin Oh can you relate to what are you must have gone through in the past month I'm guessing you can\nYeah absolutely and you're right um you know the Obama administration and the media they sent up dozens and dozens and dozens and it was right here where I'm standing right now in my yard literally in the yard to find anything but um yeah I can relate the thing that I disagree with judge Kavanaugh on is a\nProclamation that it has devastated or destroyed the family no it doesn't destroy your family your circle the wagons it it actually um you can be used it to get out there all that that um the marking that lies told about you\nKnow and really use it as empathy\nTo get out there all that that um the marking that lies told about you\nKnow and really use it at\nFor other people who go through a bunch of crap in this world because everybody does um use that power you to get out there and do the right thing and fight really really hard for the underdog fight really hard for those who don't have that platform that microphone to speak up for justice\nTo ensure a pay less cost you to take your shorts for doing this I just have to do as you see the left becoming even more on him when you hit the national spotlight it was ... years ago now I'm ... and it was unusual ready\nBut now it's ridiculous there were people literally scratching up a Supreme Court door as if they could get in and stop him from being sworn in they've gone completely nutty\nHow do you counter balance that and how do we get the voices because I think the majority of Americans aren't like that how do we get the voices are normal people among us to to rise to the top again or is that is a really hard because the media is showing joined the ratings are getting from showing these idiots\nWell yeah I mean there's a triple threat against us that the media the opposing party and then rhinos within our own party letting it happen like that so\nUh you know free against one but no we already made manifest I think our need for a change in the system and um the corruption in that lack of accountability in twenty six when what\nWe talk about the man as a person but that Trump movement where the people stood up and said enough is enough rascal gotta go will make a difference but it's funny a couple of my girlfriends and I were texting the last couple of days during the the Kavanaugh discussion on\nOur little group of girlfriends out there that we would like these radical [laughter] you know we're getting they haven't gone I\nThink that's effective memorial become unhinged I I think the more that I'm reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we said not enough is enough of that and um we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitutions all about\nLimiting government so we can govern ourselves and I know I think people like you who have the guts to be out there every day in the arena making a difference where do you guys keep it\nOkay we're going to do that is there a ... million along with millions of other Americans I voted

[laughter] really what we're going to be the lady going to be on the ... and it's just that was cute at\nOne point so let me go to the phone lines and again keep in mind it's going to be the president of F. R. C. dot org Tony Perkins after the uh the bottom of the hour but let me go to the phones and say hello to walk into a ... in San Antonio Martha what's going on\nHello Joe hello Martha I'm a high I just wanted to tell you that I think it's\nKind of a good game that Dianne Feinstein held onto that letter for six weeks 'cause I mean when we have heard more stupidity in violence from the last ... and one more thing for the first time ever I'm sixty two years old and I'm going to register tomorrow to vote\nGreat my husband is too for the first time ever [laughter]\nWow isn't that what we did this process motivate you guys to go and do that\nYes sir um we've never really been into politics but when I watched a Donald Trump come down the stairs and he said that he was going to be the best president ever I wanted\nTo believe him and my heart believed him and now I Know it's true now I Know it\nI think there are a lot of people like you I think there's a lot of people like you and your husband who probably haven't set it out loud fake you Martha appreciate your calling in um a lot of people like you were probably going to go into the same thing\nGoing to go and register to vote gonna go and vote going to go and get this done got to go and take part of the process I think it's the right thing to do\nI think is the right thing to do it I think there are a lot of people who won't call radio show would say so by the way I I disagree on her releasing earlier would have cause even more a rambling in rank or I disagree I think ... re released early on\nI think that the end result would have been we would have had the investigation sooner but if you have the investigation sooner he would have been confirmed a lot sooner or like you would have been on the court for several weeks now I'm Feinstein settlement letter for a simple reason\nShe must not have believed it\nShe must not have believed it sound like she had an independent you know investigation going on she sat on it because you didn't think he was going to get be able to get pass the committee and I don't know that she believe that the allegations were strong enough\nNow you have a judge based upon his judicial\nPhilosophy is he is going to be with the other conservatives on the court that see you see it from a a a strict constitution list viewpoint so\nThis is a big shift in our country now\nWhat we've seen and I think what what played out this division we hear all of this country so divided well you know in large part Joe it was a court that divided us right it was a court that imposed these views on Americans that we never arrived at consensus over the way our republic works\nIs that we have these elected representatives at work through these issues they arrive at consensus is not what one side wants totally nor the other side but it's a consensus but\nWhen the court steps in and short circuits that process like it did on abortion like it did on marriage\nAnd you do not reach consent consensus and there is an invasion in the culture I've never seen it more intense than it is right now and until the court moved back to its proper boundaries and the elected representatives shape the policies for this country it will continue\nIts Tony purchase the president of the family Research Council if our C. dot org you bring up some ... some very important point I'll add marriage to what I said a little while ago about what was it in the\nConstitution 'cause it's not in their sort of states should not solving these things I'm having said that what about the politics of personal destruction they will take a person that they get they absolutely\nDo anything to on the merits as Kavanaugh said you can't you couldn't beat me on the merits suddenly a letter that you had for two months showed up you couldn't beat me on the merits suddenly I'm this horrible guy I'm evil according to one you've got one guy saying that he's Spartacus you got the other people you know interrupting Grassley Everytime he spoke\n... is this debate overplay their hand these people are really start to see the ... the winding down of the ...\nYou've got the other people you know interrupting Grassley Everytime he spoke you used this debate overplay their hand these people are really start to see the ... the winding down of the politics of personal destruction when you're going after somebody you just don't like politically [noise]\nI I Wish the answer to that was yes that it's it's going to begin decreasing whereas I can see that because they saw that it didn't work I I Wish that were the case I don't think it is I I think what what what's happening here Joe\nIs that we're seeing the left throw a tantrum because they're they're accustomed to Republicans folding when the operation gets intent when they fire those first rounds of those personal destructive grounds that they fire\nThey find the Republicans I mean why did they go after the whole you know a ... alleging that he was a gang rape is that he you know attacks sexually attacked people\nBecause look conservatives we care about those things are important it's we don't want we don't want that type of stuff elevated in our society in fact we think it has no place in our society\nSo they think that they're going to make him radioactive by by accusing him of that and then everybody is just going to run from him\nWell it's a new day because we've seen that that card played over and over and over again in what's happening now is at the same cultural elite that we're attacking him the media and others playing into that\nWell they're the same people who are attacking the values that conservatives across this country hold so dear right same reason that they attacked President Trump that's why I think President Trump's support is so solid among conservatives is because it's the same people that have been attacking conservatives for the last four decades that\nAre now attacking the president and all of his nominees so I think we're in a new day I think Republicans have finally gotten the backbone conservatives are saying you know what if we want to keep this republic we have to fight for it and that means we have to stand up to the personal attacks and yeah we're going to have to take some ... some ugly hits but you know what\nWe're not going to we're not going to capitulate we're not running up a white flag in fact\nWe don't own any white flags anymore we're going to have charging\nRight what what this president I think you're right I think the white flags were put away if not if not thrown out with a different president do you think they would have folded because politically speaking it would have made sure that for the guy who nominated him to say I rescind the nomination\nWith another president would have been a very quick fraud Kavanaugh to shape our resumes you know I don't accept the nomination because of these things I'm a distraction we always hear about what our site I don't want to be a distraction\nSomebody to get out of the way it was it the ...\nYes no question you know 'cause it's another day yeah I mean look courage breeds courage and I don't agree with everything that's president said and done his lifetime right but I Do agree with his leadership today America when when we were going into this election and twenty sixteen many of us saw\nFor what it was our republic was hanging by a thread over a raging fire right and we had Donald Trump who said you know what I'm going to give up my best shot to save it and we said [laughter]\nI don't know but we don't have an option and we're going with you and and look what he's done he's done exactly what he said he was going to do he's fighting and people are tired of being pushed around being marginalized by the left now that doesn't mean let me be very clear Joe\nWe understand ... as Christians I must speak to this from a Christian samples your I run a Christian ministry right and that's the way we look at these things\nThese that Democrats are not our enemy the the the ... on our enemy we don't have those people at all we love those people but we love 'em enough to speak truth because we know that what America has to offer will only\nYou can use our enemy we don't have those people we love those people\nBut we love 'em enough to speak truth because we know that what America has to offer will only continue if we have a solid moral foundation and so we're going to work to preserve that foundation and we're going to work to strengthen America Again so then it can be a nation\nThat not only allows people here in this country to prosper but when America is strong the world is more stable America has a leading role to play and for the first time in a long time we have an administration that understands that\nAre in a minute or so we have left with Tony Perkins ... it'd be a foresee a president it's the family Research Council would ever see ... or ...\nLet me ask you about the midterms going about a month or so ago month and a half two months ago the house was certainly gold and blue is going to be a blue wave of the Senate probably would go blue to as it sits today if we stay motivated and energized I think the Senate probably picks up two or three Republican seats and the house or as now up for grabs\nIt ... the overplay their hand but I asked about a little while ago ... do you think that it it's it's a wake and a lot of people who are center center center right right right maybe even conservative we sat on their hands and said I Can't vote for a Trump\nIs going to make them go to vote in November Tony less than a month from now we're going to find out who gets to the house and Senate are they re energized will you see now this blue wave go away [laughter]\nUm I I think your analysis correct I think we see maybe two or three seats picked up in the Senate I think the houses a toss up I ... the difference icy though is that I think there were people who were trumped very supportive of Trump not supportive of a Congress that they don't think has done a whole lot during\nHis\n... to have at least a Republican Congress to to watch his back while he does the majority of the work so I think they're motivated to go vote because of what this president has accomplished\n... Indian food do you agree with me the best because the left will stop at nothing dramatically when absolutely\nAbsolutely and they they look I think what was on display in the last three weeks is how desperate the left is to keep the labor's of government and they want to do it through the courts and they know that intuitively if there's this much opposition this president this administration must be doing something right regardless of what the mania says\nWe always appreciate that drama Stony Brook is president of the family Research Council F.

[noise]\nShe so tall really tall [noise] but I mean this is what Katy Perry thought she was going to do\nAnd all they all thought they were going to Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen and all these people with a lot more talent then Taylor Swift thought they were going to make a difference bond oh and all Miley\nCyrus so yeah and then people vote for their pocketbooks and rule of law safety security\nThat's all right Taylor has her own contingent of security surely doesn't need a ice agents or police or anything like\nThat\n\nIf you're tired of paying maintenance feats of the time she can't even use you need to call resort release now\nSo many of you who have them don't want them you want to get out of them but you feel stuck they'll help you get out of that contract legally permanently and a hundred percent money back guaranteed\nPush for gender sort of a conformity\nWell I think again the more successful Trump is on the economy or foreign\nPolicy are getting all these judges on the court or any of the good things that have been happening consumer confidence the more\nSuccessful Trump is the angrier and more possessed the less become since so whether it's the toxic masculinity or whether it's you know chaining themselves to the White House doors are ... they they seem to be truly upset the things are going well in the country\n\nWell it's interesting I mean you know it it it's in saying oh well there's a couple of things that are funny\nMy wife works where the progressive woman and at some point I don't know Bill Maher name came up and maybe he was going to retire or something like that and she has now wait a minute he's like the only one on our side and I thought\nYeah Bill Maher and everyone on late night and all that news outlet and MSNBC and CNN it's it's weird\nThat hey it's it's funny to have simultaneously almost everyone in the news you what Hannity Tucker at a handful of other people excluded or the exception but almost everyone is on your side and you're claiming we have no voices on our side\nIt's interesting and then also here's how effective it is I work with a lot of young people and I don't mean young twenty five I mean you know thirty five and ... one one of the guys who worked with me who's an intelligent enough guy\nSays to me yesterday as it pertains to Kavanaugh he goes look I don't\nGet it why don't we just why didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy in there get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the paths and just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record and move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that like\nYou don't understand why they couldn't do that you don't what do you mean all the baggage\nAll the stuff that got hooked up at the eleventh hour all the stuff that wasn't substantiate it all and said allegations from high school there ... there was your book I said where do you think they were due to the next guy but he literally thought\nWe'll just get a new guy in there and then he'll get a fair shake everyone moves forward\nI think that any other president would have probably drop Kavanaugh um any other\nAnd most I think of other guys who ran against Trump in the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary\nHow many of them was stuck it out and fought for this nomination I don't think a lot of Trump knew that this was something you could not backed down from he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam though and we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy who just watches CNN and MSNBC and NBC and that's where he gets as information\nAnd he legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with capital mhm and that's to me where the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches\nNBC and MSNBC and CNN and he gets all the information and it's all going through the filter and so ... what choice but draw these conclusions she could no it couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either that's the only place you got your news\nYeah man you didn't have parents or anyone else kind of guiding you to the right well at least an objective kind of understanding okay this this is Kevin ... opinion zero three hundred he was a Bush guy was in the Bush White House for seven years\nWas Justice Kennedy's Locklear commend is not some fire breathing person going to burn down to the Supreme Court Scott but you're right that that's not what they're interested in they're interested in dominating the discussion Adam to the point that\nPeople are afraid to speak out and now those images and those video clips\nOf people like Susan Collins be cornered with her back against the law and elevator\nI mean I think they would have if you walk through that crowd on Saturday I don't know if she would have survived it frankly\nWhere you know it's interesting because I grew up around it I grew up in the seventies I had a kind of a hippie ... and it's so funny because when you think of ... hippie or progressive no one says hippie anymore but sort of progressive\nSort of tree hugger piece lover I'm going to take my daisy and I'm going to put it in a barrel of the gun of the national guardsmen just but nice that been near is rage\nIt's so funny it's almost an aspect Haitian to hide the rage the hippies were some of the most angry people I've ever met when I was a kid I figured this one out\nMy mom was kind of a hippie but she was also kind of rage fall and I think it's a compensation for the anger that's in them\nNote a picture a Rosie O'Donnell remember the old Rosie odonnell with the ... to ... to ... club member her daily ... TV show from the nineties was there ever a more ... sweet character ever she's up there to big fluffy sweaters and she's laughing\nAt it that was\nA over compensation for the rage full Rosie O'Donnell and I think all the free to be you and me tree hugging\nA three lovers I think there's rage and it's funny because they've always painted the right as the angry war mongers course so Rachel but look at all the rage on the left\nWell there there again their anger is completely\nDisconnected from the overall mood of the country so as long as long I mean literally said Hillary in there and we had seven percent unemployment and interest rates were going up and\nWe were in Syria and I'm more military ... ... ... more military in Syria Adam ... they'd be fine as long as there are social construct as being foisted upon the American public so their their their happiness political happiness exists only as America\nIs being transformed in their direction\nYes it's true it's it's a kind of ...\nYou're in your room and you have your toys who cares if the whole neighborhood is crumbling as long as you're occupied with what you what are your watching what you want on TV sort of a ... with immediate gratification\nSo yes it's true listen I live in Los Angeles I I I get it\nThe ice you have to step over piles of homeless people we're gonna have a a typist epidemic coming any day now because uh the homeless people are getting the fleas from the rap\nI mean it is it started with your more here but as long as uh the folks in power keep their power uh they're they're happy now their rage roll again\nAgainst Trump don't get me wrong but we have I live in one of the worst runs cities in the in the country\nYeah well again [laughter] and I'm Carl is with us here on the ... show I have to play something for your number and then we'll let you close it out and this was Hillary are being interviewed about you know the state of things in America today let's\nNot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the Senate that twin civility can start again\nAdam [laughter] [laughter]\nNo these are the people who kick you in the share and and then you push 'em in the shoulder and they go why did you push me\nIs if it's on I mean\nI Do feel and it kinda makes you feel like you're taking crazy pills right mhm and also basically what she's saying is what you just said which is as soon as we get our way and will stop during a tantrum and then civility\nWe'll we'll set in a also this notion I I I I I have to go on a quick rant here this notion of\nI Would like to destroy the environment so that my kids all live underground for their adult lives like I hate women or even though I have a daughter and ... and a wife I hate people that look different than me or I hate gay people\nIt is one of the most insulting people never really think about how in Seoul thing it is I mean it's wrong but calling everyone a racist and everyone massages everyone homophobic and FEMA phobic it's wildly insulting to those of us are just raise their families and pay their taxes or walk their dogs\nWell that is such a great way of putting it and I think again that feeling of being insulted and kind of kicked to the curb or demeaned\nMaligned racist sexist homophobic all the things that the ... the ... is a I think that drove the electorate and twenty sixteen and we'll see how many people that drives a to vote and twenty Eighteen on both sides Adam Corolla we love having you on a congratulations on all your success\n[noise]\nIf you haven't been to the new Diamondbacks Shooting Sports you should get their ... they've been voted Tucson favor gun shot three years in a row and have an even bigger and better selection than before more firearms more personal protection items and more accessories if you have a specially item they don't carry and stop making get it ordered and get it to you fast\nDiamond backs Shooting Sports is one of the few class three dealers in town where you can get suppressor they have on site guns missing including Sarah toting\nFor your personal protection knives pepper spray and tasers diamond backs Shooting Sports offers classes on everything you need to know about that in safety at handling and they can help you get your sea cw permit\nDiamond backs shooting sport voted Tucson favor gun store\nThirty east Broadway nearly a quarter a Broadway and coal open every day and on line and feedback shooting for dot com [noise]\nInvestment advisor for Claude trafficking whether together on a seven during Tucson morning new juice on the news and talk ...

itself\nAfter grueling confirmation fight than including graphic sexual misconduct allegations which the nominee denied Kavanaugh is confirmed Saturday on Fifteen a forty eight votes\nAnd ceremonial swearing in will be held Monday evening and that and he joins the court replacing retired Justice Anthony Kennedy prominent Democrat single the fight over his seat and the court itself will extend well beyond next month's midterms\nNow they went to impeach him as an insult to the American public Trump's that Monday so feeling over the confirmation process and predicting Republican candidates would only benefit from the controversy in the mid term Democrats they'll maintain the fines energizing their core we will not stop marching we will not stop fighting DNC chairman Tom ... statement\nOver the weekend former attorney general Eric Holder said the courts legitimacy should be brought into question with the addition Kavanaugh\nSo they're actually talking to an impeachment right All right so let's break that down who gets to impeach which body but house or the Senate and the Senate ...\nTo bring a peach rent the Senate would say guilty or innocent or guilty or not guilty\nSo the Senate would actually hear the the trial the the house has to call for impeachment so I mean it's stupid it's a waste of time it's political wrangling it's dumb it's backward it's a disingenuous is ignorant it's on and tell it because they just keep going you could\n\n... the house right now cannot teach anybody because the Republican or I guess they could if they're if they chose to to be for they want the Republicans have a house or in support of Brett Kavanaugh\nOkay and um I mean\nThere's there will be no impeachment uh left the house goes to the Democrats in November but here's the weird part for me the Democrats aren't smart enough to know I mean I don't think they're dumb generally speaking but this is a dumb move\n'em [noise]\nThey don't appear smart enough to know that the Republican and conservative base doesn't want Brett Kavanaugh impeached and we don't want Donald Trump impeached just saying that he's going to be impeached\nIs ridiculous that can only happen if they win the house they're actually hurting their chances of winning the house so here I Am six six in one half does any other do I want them to keep saying that they're going to impeach so that more Republicans and conservatives go and vote or don't want him to stop saying it because it's so stupid I don't know\nI I actually don't have a good answer for myself\nRussia itself what do I want oh I Love mcgary I'm going to answer I Gotcha but that's really where we are right\nI mean that that's really truly where we are we're at a place where either the house does it real or the Democrats don't realize that they can and piecemeal us they they have the majority and they don't not neither house in ... miles from the Senate um and they're actually telling voters vote for us will raise your taxes\nWe will send jobs away will make the unemployment rate go up we'll probably get a Medicare for all the tune of thirty two trillion dollars something we could never do\nOr we're going to impeach the president impeach the ... the Supreme Court justice that was just place we basic that's a winning combination they actually think let's let's abolish ice let's open the border they think this is a winning combination so I guess I kind of want them to keep yet but [laughter] I kind of want them to keep on talking\nKeep on saying stupid stuff and at the end of the day where you're going to have you use or a Republican majority in both the house and Senate and then my game and both the house and Senate so I guess some leaning towards ... saying it I don't know I guess that's that's what I Want I I Would guess\nNow I think they're going to stop anytime soon either so\nI guess I just don't understand why they think democratic voters are going to be\nSomehow empowered to go to the polls the typical Democrats a center left leaning person is not a fascist there's not a far left this is not in in the fall below in person but not an anarchist the average left or the average Democrat somebody who had done a bunch of Democrats they still believe in fiscal conservatism a lot of them\nAnd just on social stuff they lean to the left they're not going to run out and try to get rid of this guy on the Supreme Court they're not gonna run out and try to get rid of the president that can run out and and in one impeachment and by the way you probably I think you're right you're probably still hear about impeachment for the entire run of this thing because\nThe media although I don't think they they really care one way or the other about Donald Trump another they pretend like they're against them they want impeachment because if you impeach\nThen you've got high ratings let me go to the phone lines is similar to a jet\nI got out of town you know hey hey you know what you got to have communist as stop stupidity right and I went to the economist says and I mean\n... ... but it's still it is a you know and I am applauded Democrat sheets that's fallen these idiots these people\nDon't have no a deal or what they know what or how to run a country look at the last eight years of Obama that share show what they let you all about\n... hats on get get let's go to a poll and get help if the economy get better don't\nSit there and go with the ban what is it what ... ... ... ... Democrats using your laptop bad habits come home depot is what they doing it and make that motel you know I ...\n... I'm okay with around [laughter] I'm okay with it rambled come on [laughter]\nBut it is on making it bad but a real rape victims victims your daughter's act that daughter and ... out all your belly\nAnd go with if something happens much out and I got a son\nAnd my son I Want to make sure that he just don't get accused and he's able to date itself right all your people wake up and understand what the Democrats don't want to discourage a trend that do we got to put a stop to it all ... states with the red wave this will cut off\nBut big a motel you know and I know in you know and I know the Democrats never going to quit it don't matter\nHow you're given a J you know Democrats and they're they're not people who were yelling about impeachment they just are confused me to ... the Democrats who were in charge here saying impeachment do they really think that's going to work\nThey know where they go low but they got the media being ... and all this stuff that immigrants don't even know what's going on they they voters most of them don't even know what's going on that list they look at ABC CBS and they sell it in the wrong\nAnd CNN and if you're looking at them you know your last in the shuffle hotel or do they not getting the right information up to date people\nPay for the Democrats genes get all the red wagon because you will prosper\nTime if you move away from New\n... double rats and that's it they rats love you break that down to ... or\nMr ... meeting with Haley and the oval office informed reporters Tuesday Haley and told him about six months ago she wanted a break and presidents and Haley has been very special to him they hate the loser and if you will be in constant touch Mr Trump that hopefully Haley can come back to the ministry\nThank alright so there you go in the ... which to me is that there would be any speculation about her running against him in the who's the journalists that asked that question I\nDon't know I don't know so you've worked for this guy and he he named\nYou one of the highest level positions in the administration in the cabinet now that you're leaving hey you run into twenty twenty what\nBecause President Trump is already said that he's running a twenty twenty he's already said that\nSo I'm not really I'm not clear\nOn exactly what it is and we're talking about here why that would be one of the first questions that she's asked now I'm ... I Hope that she stays in public life 'cause again I think that she's she's very good I'm I'm sure that he'll sell like somebody else another story that won't be um reported is widely today I think\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong maybe you've seen it everywhere but Brett Kavanaugh has committed to make his entire staff women\nI did hear that yeah but that's a really good thing you know the leftist going to say right white because there's a rapist you wants women around I mean that's a stupid they are and that increased in an argument yeah\nIt would be it would be ridiculous argument I'm so again I'm a couple of stories that are going to make negative that Nikki Haley says you can't even worked for him any more probably going to run against them and twenty twenty which nobody has that ever and um and the other one Brett Kavanaugh was hiring women that doesn't seem to matter so when we look at\nWhat it is that the left is doing when it comes to cabinet when it comes to Trump when it comes to all of this political wrangling I wanted to break down what the mentality is so to that and we'll have Dr gene allowed none next our a little less than an hour from now and we'll talk to her about that she's got a book out that\nActually goes right at that topic mad politics keeping your sanity and they're all gone crazy will have or event will also have agriculture secretary the USDA secretary I'm Sonny Perdue\nSonny Perdue and uh it's it's interesting talking to Sonny Perdue because\nI'm farmers you're not really sure what to think the left tried as I say oh got badly the farmers are being hurt when in fact the former seem to still be supporting President Trump we talk about the R fs which many people don't know what that is we also talked about the farm bill we're talking about a Fifteen which I'd never heard of before I've heard of eighty five\nBut now we're talking about a Fifteen\nAnd why that's so important so we do that we also talked about trade between specifically between Mexico\nAnd the United states of America and and what that prognosis looks like um I think it looks great of course if you're somebody who's on the left like Robert Francis O'Rourke the fourth generation Irish American called himself that though\nUm if you're that guy you know do you think that somehow Trump is ruining our trade with our friends across the border which of course is not happening All right so we'll take calls on Haley we'll take calls and cabinet and his um his office he is going to be appointing his assistance will all be female or we could talk about uh about trade certainly but um for\nMe\nThe lunacy that we saw on Saturday at the Supreme Court where they you know what they were chasing right Harry that Shane shut it down and\nShut it down the leftist thought they would shut down the Supreme Court of the United states of America and then they weren't scratching and clawing at a dormant of copper\nMhm maybe I'm missing I ... it looked like great fun maybe I'm missing the fun to be had to go and act like an ass wagon at the Supreme Court and I don't I don't know if you're going to to assemble and and you know be a public nuisance\nI I Would pick somewhere other than a court you know I just think that\nIs she saying hey I'm here to steal something it just it would make sense to me now because those are the people that can actually make you pay for um\nFor stealing something so again thought sudden Nikki Haley I don't know where it will help we hope to have her on certainly we've not had her own yet a former governor of South Carolina you wonder if she goes back home relax for a while maybe thinks about the Senate runner or something like that she's not going to challenge the guy that just gave her the job that would be stupid\nThat would be as dumb as if a Hillary ran against Obama in twenty twelve which of course she didn't but doesn't make sense you get a high level job last thing you do is bite the hand the ...\nOf eight eight eight nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe packs dot com quick right we're just getting going here want to hear from you on this and we got much more
