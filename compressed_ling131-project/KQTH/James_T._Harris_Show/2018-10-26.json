writing too which is the most of the matter is that it hurts them into an addict too and I hate that 'cause I'm like oh man yeah lots going on lots to get your last talked about it is uh the Joe ... show eight eight eight nine for one pack 'cause we've got\nSome big stories that we're talking about certainly we're talking about the bomb scare that's going to be best to get she continues\nBut it was it turns out it was CNN that actually put up some sort of a a color graphic a tire on if you will\nThat said I'm going to bomb the bomb threat against Trump opponents or something like that and to me that is so completely illegitimate\nWhen it comes to the way you're supposed to act as the media and did you see we're Jim Acosta big baby Jimmy ... when he complained that President didn't mention CNN\nI did see that yeah well that's yeah Kari what helped me understand that I don't think I\nCan serve the president mentions CNN\nAnd calls them fake news recalls the matter whatever he's mad about it because the president now is attacking CNN how dare you attack the good people that are trying so hard to cover the news for the American people mhm then when he doesn't mention CNN a cost as a problem why don't you mentioned I\nMean yeah and appear that way but that's I mean I got it right writing you did you did\nDo you think strictly speaking the job of reporters to act like that\nAnd and Joe I think what ended up happening is a guy like Joaquin who I work for who I Believe is actually more centrist then he left on I think a guy like walking has to push so far to the left in order to appease the bay\nBy throwing out innuendos and guess things that seemed completely out of left field but I've got to tell you that I\nI gotta tell ya I don't know what team because he's afraid to talk to me I've never met the guy I met his brother and I know his brother but if I only know him from his Twitter feed\nOr from where he shows up on local television only supporting illegal aliens and so on\nI have to make a decision about who the guy is\nSo if I invite you to come on and you show me that you're somebody different I'm done with that and and it's not about me it's about the reach I have\nBut he doesn't want to do that 'cause I think you're right I think that he will you'll make the overlords on the far left\nMad at him so he's got to keep on being this guy who keeps on going as hard left line and he's gonna find themselves out of a job he's going to find themselves on trustworthy and he's going to find himself in real pickle if he needs to rely on police after alleging that the police or the bad guys\nThat's all I'm saying and I'm I'm a common sense of ... logical guy if you're a blue dog Democrats than you and I disagree on some stuff but you listen to my show because I'm guessing you get some fact out of it and then you get some entertainment out of it walking to man up a little bit and actually answer to these ridiculous over the past two weeks he's made himself look very foolish\n\nOkay well I guess they got a phone call to make that [laughter] I think I I Do love lifted in your show I Am a I I mean I thirty five guy born and raised going into your ...\nAnd and and I see things a little bit left of center but I'm not Rachel Maddow on now\nI got a brother no no I completely understand ... who do me a favor of it\nI'm going to put you back on hold and I want to see him to get some more information from you because if you do get a hold of walking and then we'll see I mean I I have to take risks word for and we do to verify that he's friends with a with members of the family on Facebook so that's why I went with it seemed to be your favorite talk to him get his information\nAnd and give them the ability to get a hold of you again\nSpoke so that's why I went with it seemed to me a favorite talk to him get his information\nAnd I give them the ability to get a hold of you again\nI'm In fact he talks to congressman Castro I don't I think they'd Vickers giving him too much credit I don't think they'll walk he will ever come on the show they look\nThe the thing is in in many of you know who's ... who's now across the country because he's the da in ... County Texas he got voted out or in the primary primary by George Soros who injected a million dollars um he's a guy that walked away\nHe said enough is enough I Can't have this far left wing of the party\nYou don't represent who I'm trying to be and by the way Nico was a was a liberal you're not a liberal but he was a Democrat and and we first met when he came on my show I question the idea that as the da and going after the death penalty on somebody who killed a police officer\nI didn't understand that we had a conversation I still don't necessarily agree with him but we we actually had a meeting of the minds when we went okay wherever like minded and a lot of stuff and we're very serious guys or very kind of played of so I'm Glad we have a conversation\nWalking Castro just needs to do that and not for my benefit for the benefit of those were watching and those were listening he's not willing to do that because he finds himself and he's very far left wing faction of that party\nAnd even those who who lean to the left are no longer voting for a guy like that is he going to win this election coming up yeah I don't even know who's competition is industry twenty\nBut should he continued to rise the answer is no the far left in this country will either wake up and realize that it's over for them and they'll start getting more moderate or going to keep on doing it and it's going to be easy when after easy win for Republicans in those early to the right it is it eight nine four one package Joe ... dot com stay right here\n[noise] [noise]\n\nLet\nMe ask you a personal question of financial question what is the balance on your credit card and what is the interest rate on that credit card why not turn those balances into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate and start saving money\nLight stream offers credit card consolidation loans from six point one four percent NPR with auto pay get a loan from five thousand a hundred thousand dollars and you can even get your funds as soon as the day you apply light streamed believes that people have good credit deserve a great interest rate and no fees plus there were a division of sun trust bank\nOne of the nation's largest financial institutions that you can have complete\nPeace of mind my listeners can save even more right now that additional interest rate discount on top of light streams already low rates\nThe only way to get the discount as good a light streamed dot com slash bags\nThat's L.

latest on a ... what do we do the turban earlier we did the bomb earlier with the bombs yeah ... what do you ever me from Fox\nNews President Trump tweeted a stern warning Thursday the Niagara caravan heading toward the United states telling the thousands of people currently making their way to Mexico to turn around as us troops are set to move the southern border those the caravan turn around me or not letting people into the United states illegally the president tweeted\nGo back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing some sweet comes only hours after us official confirmed Fox News hundreds of us troops just had to make their way to the southern border to help homeland security and National Guard troops deal with the migrant caravan\nOfficials that roughly eight hundred active duty soldiers would be sent to the area to offer logistical support including providing tenth and vehicles to the Twenty one hundred National Guard troops on the southern border assisting homeland security it's unclear what you're going to be deployed to the border or why they're being deployed since National Guard troops can perform the same functions\nBut defense secretary Jim Mattis consigned the deployment orders as early as Thursday federal law however prohibits the use of active duty service\nBut defense secretary Jim Mattis consigned the deployment orders as early as Thursday federal law however prohibits the use of active duty service members for law enforcement inside the U.S\nUnless specifically authorized by Congress and Trump tweeted earlier Thursday Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border and then he was using the military for what he called a national emergency vowing they will be stopped in apparent reference to the caravan which is still about a thousand miles from the U.S Mexico border and starting to dwindle\nAnd previous migrant marches have largely dissipated before reaching the United states is Berlin caravan of migrants once estimated by the United nations to be more than seven thousand strong it's hoping to make it to the United states knows her Honduran seeking to escape the poverty and violence the planes in the region\nAnd been like Maxine Waters or or Deborah Wasserman show show says the return address is that a normal\nIt's a little strange and again the fact that the bombs if they are even ... we don't know that they're bomb youngest their boss but maybe they were made to look like a bomb you know\nMaybe they are either but I think the main goal this person is to get media attention you know that's what they're doing so we haven't you know we've seen pictures that device and I'm not a bomb expert um but I heard people say\nThat's what they're doing so we haven't you know we've seen pictures that device and I'm not a bomb expert um but I heard people saying they're bomb like um and so we don't really know what they are none of them but I Know of it has been detonated right\nEven if they would say so uh adding all those things together it appears at this person is or somewhere that wants to get attention whether them rather than some of that was actually kill\nIs this my definition terrorism\nYeah it is terrorism because we're all for it people are afraid and they're causing fear they're causing public attention that's part of the the the working definition of a terror attack or terrorists and as you get one frightened ten thousand\nWe don't know who did this we don't know if it's some sort of a a you know an extremist on the writer extremist on the left we have no clue\nAnd hopefully we'll find out sooner than later oh do you have an opinion on on CNN and other networks making this about the president\nAnd who's alleged rhetoric um any any surprises in your mind that CNN and other outlets are now reporting that well this was really camping down the excitement on the right and conservative probably will go and vote now because of his thoughts on that\nWell again we live in a very political world in the media obviously has their own political views reporters expressed their political views in ways that are offensive to many people are are they most Americans are sophisticated enough to know which channels to watch if you want to get a particularly spin on the news rights\nAre and so you know that's that's to be expected I think we're living in the new normal now where certain news networks they do report the news anymore they're obviously rooting for what side or the other and I think people can pick up on that\nIt's important to mention all mentioned it but Maxine Waters in her rhetoric about harassing people in public who you know starting up\nAnd being loud and reading them down would have been in a restaurant or a gas station that wasn't any big deal but it's just politics as usual\nBut but this thing suddenly used the president's fall because he he dared say your fake news it's very strange to me is Jeff Jeff ... lieutenant colonel of course he's the director of the center for tourists law as St Mary's university Jeff who's in the caravan at bottom when you tell me the names of all fourteen or eight thousand whatever it is today\nBut um who who do you think we're finding\nIn Medicare Advantage and using your belief from your history in your in your experience that they could send out a tweet and have seven thousand people gather in Honduras and start heading north [noise]\nWell you know there's many things that we have an answer about this this caravan of ... or whatever but the hordes of people is what it is yeah you can learn because uh you know one thing we can be a sure I'm In ... you know if this\nIs this group of individuals is not halted before they get to the U.S border\nOr dealt with in expeditious matter at the U.S border you'll see another caravan and another caravan uh twice the size and three times the size\nYou know if you build it they will come yeah so the question is you know do we have the right to have national borders and to control who comes into our country or not and that's something that our Congress needs to deal with with a lack worthy they haven't done it for a very very long time\nOr the president in many ways his hands are tied and it's a very sad sad state of affairs to me that uh that were even even in the situation\nI'm like yeah in the care of and we've got different reports even coming from El Salvador Guatemala government officials are talking about you know individuals that could be terrorists in the group well it's certainly never X amount of criminals associate with this group\nUm and you can expect that you know that most people that come here illegally have to pay someone to bring him across the border this is a cheap way to do it and that's why you're getting a lot of people are attracted to come to it but whatever the motivation wherever they are they don't have the right to simply show up and you know\nBoy you're getting a lot of people are attracted to come to it\nBut whatever the motivation wherever they are they don't have the right to simply show up and you know demand that we take care of these individuals in our country that's to me that's illogical and it doesn't make sense a we have a process we have a legal process I'm all for single immigration against illegal immigration\nAid so technical Jeffrey out a guy whose book is called radical Islam why go and get it yeah we're hearing that there are factors the middle eastern they're wearing the infection from Asia in their um you may mentioned before we started the interview today and I thought this was a very salient point that there are people who were covering their faces why would you have to cover your face if you're looking for a better job with a better life\nYeah exactly and if you look at the if you just do the visual a vast majority appear to me to be able bodied working age a young male you know so you're wondering okay so\nAh you know I understand that the economic problems are here or there and your country but can't you stay there to work to make the place a better place or you know I don't I don't know the narrative is strange to me or whatever the whatever the reason I can appreciate I can sympathize with people wanting to\nBetter themselves nothing wrong with that but we have a legal process that legal process has to be followed\nA legal process has to be a better\nUh I I think articulated by man on how and who is allowed to come into this country if you're seeking asylum international law is the first country did you injury is where you seek asylum and that would be Mexico not the United states\nDid so we've kind of double jeopardy ... center returns last say marriage university jumped as the commander in chief have the right to say this is an invading force and put the military on the border\nIt can make that determination and and uses emergency powers to do so we do have the ... the the federal government cannot uh support this is a congressional law passed back in the Eighteen hundreds can I was\nA law enforcement to make arrests or searches and seizures but if this is a national security interests uh where individuals are coming across the international border which is our border I I think the ... act doesn't apply circumstances of that nature in my personal opinion there are things that can't be done\nUm but I Would like to see that as a as a last resort I think we need to work out a some type of system where the Mexican government the Mexican authorities or they're going through their country they're saving to make no effort to turn them back or to deal with the\n... do you think you would be likely that will be affected with the president said forget at the U.S MCA that new agreement that we just made\nThat's off the table if you don't stop something you don't do something what would be effective against the for the Mexican government to step up and take action to do ... whatever it's called the Caribbean or whatever before it gets more border can you figure something that would be effective\nYeah I mean I economic pressure as one way you can uh negotiate with the Mexican government and I think that's probably a very effective mechanism that we have at our disposal another way would be to build a wall so that they cannot come into the country and claim\nOr you don't do the catcher least process uh because yeah it's true that you know forty percent of people that are here illegally overstay their visas they fly him right for the flying there ... there was that the drug cartel people don't talk to criminal elements those people are walking yeah that's a concern that we have\nWhether the sixty percent or walking across the border but again it's just back to basics are worse sovereign nation\nWe're a nation state United Nations is built on the concept of national sovereignty or we have the right to secure our borders and determine who comes into our country\nUh and that's you know just one oh one city common knowledge and should the common responsibility a common sense\nKnow he does it makes perfect sense in in rational mind would would think that way of course there were many irrational people in this country\nAlso do the economist says yeah no it does it makes perfect sense in in rational minds would would think that way of course there were many irrational people in this country moving we shouldn't have borders and and a lot of them are big danger you know on the left\nOr age lieutenant colonel Jeffrey ... director of the center of terrorism well see Mary's university but even the book is a radical Islam why one last quick question Jeff ... and I wonder if you've got a quick answer to a very complicated question um how does this thing resolve itself are they going to get here are we going to have eight to fourteen thousand people just show up\nWell the secret that we have far more than the number of the Caribbean coming come across the border every year\nBut this is a headline grabbing thing it's all coming together so it might be a silver lining here where it was pitch of what's really happening all the work here at the number of illegal aliens streaming across or something to be done\nAbout I'm with you I agree wholeheartedly get his book radical Islam why it's lieutenant

allegedly\nBoroughs are cool what are your ... cinco de Maya did you did you do this to go to miles a bigger deal than it is in Mexico\nI ... a professor of not knowing how\nThat's why they have a problem I think as they say oh well into my isn't a big deal in Mexico so we shouldn't be celebrating here in America because it just taking Hispanic culture and giving it to them\nI Know how dare you to tell anybody who's Hispanic or Mexican heritage that goes to school with you that we're no longer to go to celebrate cinco de Mayo because it might be offensive they would be offended by us not doing it listen I'm In San Antonio Texas is sixty five percent Hispanic\nThe vast majority ethnically or national ... nationality wise they're American but they're Mexican American\nThey ... they would go nuts if we stop doing cinco de Mayo that's just dumb do these professors at your opinion do they realize how overboard they've gone been overplayed their hands to the point to where the people that they think they're protecting or actually saying stop it it's like Pocahontas it's like Elizabeth Warren the Cherokee Indian nation is asked her to stop it now you know what I mean\nYeah I Know that and they're not going to stop anytime soon and they'll probably doubled down and go as far as they can because they they think that what state of the student body and they fear the ramifications that they didn't say something but the people who that social justice worries on campus but they're afraid that the reaction that they get from them if they didn't speak out against it\nHe's from campus reform dot org ... every day like I Do go read these great stories where there's great young reporters putting the legacy media it's a shame Mick story professor lectures about honorary whites Bennett mine Henri white I'll even know what that means\nSo it was it was weird 'cause they listed three different uh three different groups there were as whites honorary whites and then there's collective blacks watch so so honorary whites are people they said light skinned Hispanics\nAsian Americans or Middle Eastern people who look like on the outside so that honorary whites and with it they get some of the privilege that comes with the ... person [laughter]\nThese are people who look like on the outside to their honorary whites and with it they get some of the privilege that comes with ...\n[laughter] where where where were they teach them as what what school was this\nAh this was at it was a school lists east it was a guy every ... ...\nWas it Amherst okay yeah so um have some sort of Everest\nVery not only deciding what your level of privileges by your actual heritage your ancestry or race or you're a new city they're actually looking at you and saying I deem you to be of a skin tone that's light enough that you also enjoy the privileges screw your heritage\nOr any kind of comes back to how racist the left as without knowing it is and the name of a quality and they they themselves are being more racist and they're creating diversity hierarchy of who can be the most oppressed and so if you're not even look kind of white on the outside you're an honorary away and with it you have the privilege that he must this town\nIt's a band McDonald go follow them at ... zero five zero seven it's interesting what you just said do they do they know that they're being racist or their ... their overtly racist against white people do they really not know that do they really think that they're being not racist by doing all this racist stuff\nYeah I think it makes them feel good and I think when they break it down they don't realize oh well if you're dividing people by race and saying that these days racist because they look different on the outside have a certain amount of privilege prescribe to them\nAnd that's a racist and end up itself but it makes them feel good and they can get up on that more high horse and say I've they're better than you when in reality they don't they're more racist than anyone else\nDo you have an opinion as to why they're doing it is it white guilt is it that they really believe ... the heritage of this country was evil we found in this nation on horrible things raping and pillaging and killing people\nI think a lot of it actually is that they've been at ... I think that the founding fathers were racist slave owners and the history that comes to the white people and slavery and I think all of that does that erases all that good that's been done and so white people are ill and ... then you yourself are part of that privilege that comes with it\nAnd a lot of the people that are saying these are in fact white right\nThere are a lot of people that are white and then there are a lot of people in radical minority clubs on campuses that come out and say that too\nAnd they get away with it because we because history because slavery which is interesting is they have the right to say these ridiculous things because of how the country was founded do they not see the irony and attacking the founding fathers that set this way up to allow them to complain\nThat they don't [laughter] to me because if you do this in Cuba we do in China you know they run you over with a tank here you can say you can get away with it and and it's stunning to me that you think they actually believe it I guess they must right\nYeah I mean you know you have to go to China are ... they're tapping in Europe as well\nOr any other around them a hundred percent it's happening in Saudi Arabia to having the middle east so yeah I mean it's it's beyond just communist or social as nations we are the free use most liberated nation ever created on earth and they're complaining about it and they can only complained about it because we are\nI Do is they want it so hard concept or last one to UVA Latina I'm going to see a Latina is let's you know\nI Know that there's thing with the news 'cause they don't want it to sound like a male causes Latino and I'm not going to say look you know and with Tina in fact they should just say lighten the fact that we're seeing the Spanish word is kind of dumb but be Latino students are demanding more Latino for two of faculty\nAnd they also want more Latino studies majors available in in the school now ... correct me if I'm wrong these are people that have chosen to go to ... they weren't forced to go there right\nQuite and it was the most diverse class ever recorded for ...\nAnd ... so\nYou ... they weren't forced to go there right\nCredit and it was the most diverse class ever recorded or ...\nAnd ... so the class has more people other than whites because that's with diverse means I'm ... and they did have a list of faculty members that they could see before they signed up right\nCrap so they could have chosen a college or university that in fact had the percentage of Latino professors are studies that they wanted yes\n... complaining that now that they're there they knew it goes back to the show is their\nUnconscious racism 'cause they don't care about them ... any of that professors they don't care at ... at the college that crashed ... will be ... it can be a ... they're not qualified at all but because they are Latin professor they want them to be there\nWhat do you think would outlast question and I appreciate your being what do you think would happen if I were a student or oh you're you're a young student you go to class and the teacher is other than white and you say I'm going to need a white instructor what would happen\nAnd ... out of class and maybe ... ...\nYou wouldn't be going to school there any more than it would be ... to be following you and everything else but but do it against whites that's perfectly fine identity politics this is going to end up being the death knell of the left of actually and I don't want them to die but it's gonna be the death knell of this movement because\nThis is showing who they really are and people who are in the center\nThey're starting to get it they go I Can't side with them after they do the cabin objects as it

a Mexican comes across illegally or he or she can be repatriated almost immediately but if you're not from a continuous country shore um Central America that's not the case it's a crazy loophole that needs to be fixed um but in the meantime what can we do then to repatriate them if they actually do get across\nA through executive order I think that that makes a lot of sense to effectively make it an extension of the travel ban but I think Andrew here's the bigger point I don't want to have that confrontation\nLess incentivized Mexico and find somebody else me kind of threatened or threatened Mexico\nTo take care of this problem because they should for too long Mexico has not been acting look Mexico's a friend and ally but they're not acting like an on this issue and they have gladly pass the buck and allowed in facilitate obese care of it has to go north and become our problem well they've got to do their part\nWell this is part of it we have leverage on them particularly a trade\nAs it happened I'm Sorry I don't know but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration\nAnd you have a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees from the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their continue was ... ... it's interesting you talk about this is talk of the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highways that that travel right along the border I Want to say it's a high five I don't remember I Know it's on I think that that goes north south I think it's I tend interstate ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea of something like that simply walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me then I'm thinking as he was relative\nThough of course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic a you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger of laws for of course border here's the reality the president wasn't far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know\nThis isn't conspiracy theory nonsense citizen from some far right a website the Laredo station of the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred and Bangladeshis\nAre crossing illegally now why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from Bangladesh um Bangladesh also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic terrorists\nSo there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here from Bangladesh you know even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think is very eye opening shore and tells us you know that that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred how many have we not caught um so it doesn't make sense for economic security\nIt doesn't make sense for national security it's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop this and I think we need to get Mexico\nTo do their part we need to use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way it it that doesn't work if it comes to it we will see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get that trick pony and\nBut I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the crisis of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nBy the way the interstate that I was looking for the interstate eight this south of interstate panic goes right along the border in Arizona and California and my guess is the Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back to the thing about being a phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I've said this a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut the one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes them\nMake it very clear I've said this a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut the one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is affected anybody can come to America and become an American\nRight that that is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else so you go just about anywhere else that you go in the world but I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan in the same thing Korea the same thing but anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you can you cannot expect\nIf you're going to come up here on moss\nAnd and do something about it so the president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border\nUm there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates ... I don't believe that it does having read the various statutes that are out there where do you come down on this\nRight now I don't think so because it's it's a clear danger to our orders external dangerous so you know I don't think it does it by the way I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you played that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning yes totally insulting\nTo America trying to make us a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what do they do they just call this race of course and and trying to dismiss us but here's here's the reality of America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become a legal immigrant and you're so right the second you are you're an American no questions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world oh so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship\nAnd it is about borders and it's largely by the way I pointed out to the Joe Scarborough it's largely about protecting American citizens many of whom happen to be minorities a black and Hispanic American I Believe sucker more than anyone\nFrom tolerating illegal immigration a why because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market against illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans perhaps the most of all to tolerate porous border\nYou know my ... my my my colleagues see motley and less government dot dot org has talked to a great deal of about that issue about sort of the economics of this as well in the end for me it comes down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty\nIf we don't control who is migrating here on them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who's coming in a pretty soon find himself without a nation and we certainly\nDon't want that sea of Cortez how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nights be on air and we're not tonight and on Twitter at court as the C O R G E S C\nI Will listen I appreciate that will put up some Andrew language show page I'm sure we have links up in the ... thank you so much for joining us today\nThanks for having me listen it's interesting 'cause he was talking about the issues of of people of color in America\nA and one of the things that I wanted to get to today I really did get a chance to get to was this issue of\nUh the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to be posted at the White House today and then they're doing the gala event tonight here in Washington DC uh you know president is really doing what he can because\nRight it's funny or the American dream is about everybody\nIt is about every but it's about bringing everybody in and the only way you can do that is by creating the conditions whereby everybody can succeed\nWe've talked about this about sort of good economic news today uh the the we have the GDP\nBut he can succeed we've talked about this about sort of good economic news today uh the the we have the GDP out a GDP is it the third quarter GDP a three point five percent of a\nTenth of a percentage point above a where it was expected that as a immeasurably good news and yet and yet we're not talking about this by the way I Am taking your tweets I I did get an ice as I said I Do read the critical tweets here\nKevin tweets and Andrew please stop saying ah every two seconds of what I get excited to picks up a when I get excited I I tend to speak over myself and I get a little closer to my speech be when I'm looking at breaking news on the TV sometimes I get a little distracted by that so I Do apologize\nSometimes I Do try to work very hard on my on my verbal textbook Kevin thank you so very much for listening so intimately to that\n[noise] ah Patty writes in on Twitter by the way you can tweet at me at angel underscores anger\nPatty writes I found you a good job of filling in for Laura we need evidence confirmed if this is a liberal sending the bombs uh it must be what idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much tension didn't Brennan have rights them come from ... to him I got to go back and look at that I don't remember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly wasn't the folks\nAt the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that\nWe got a couple of more minutes here on the show\nBefore we close out for the day I'll continue to take your tweets at Andrew underscore Langer continue to take your phone calls eight five five forty ... is the number eight five five four zero L.

you'll go you'll see his father his father's around retired teacher from the edge what school district that's all I ...\nI was short and sweet they're calling him a seminal Puerto Rican nine line is the first time I heard that okay but what you said probably American indian identity and described as long as I'm American yeah you know what you're talking about being a seminal yeah uh on on Twitter\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point but thank you for saying that because that\nThat's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades in in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half\nReally and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges from\nThe Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to really\nAgain is never going to give them a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or the the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your jaw I Want to come on but I don't even have two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American who pays taxes has a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are now manufacturing stuff here again or promising yes just started doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success says\nThat we got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas are manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and in in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest or economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent um uh for the entire year here because of an more good news\nAnd he never had a year never\nHad a year he broke three percent um uh for the entire year here because of an more good news again this morning in the third quarter that three and a half percent growth beat the predictions ... down very strong consumer confidence spending what that means\nIs America's growth will end up above three percent this year just blowing past all the predictions before our new tax code and tax cuts so the tax law this new tax law is working for millions of Americans\nIt really is a ... and also by the way getting rid of the individual mandate helped out a bit of an eighty percent you and I talked about his eighty percent of those who are taxed\nBecause of the individual mandate we're we're in the middle class or lower middle class area they all got a tax break when that went away as Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair of the president last week or a few days ago said I\nGot another big tax cut coming going to go to middle class families is going to be a big tax cuts it's coming it's on the way you and I have talked about two point oh what does this look like and you can you let us in a little bit\nSo it's really this one's a little ... to win a two point oh it was really about you know tax forms about changing the trajectory of the economy and putting America back into the lead role that succeeded two point oh it was about changing the culture in Washington so that every year we make the tax code better they are more competitive so that means permanence\nFor families and small businesses that that's fair\nThat their tax cuts are made permanent plus creates another million and a half new jobs\nThe second part of the tube when I was about to savings helping families\nSay more in earlier for their life really important the third is about helping started businesses in innovation dropped back to America that's two point oh it's passed the house already and actually even picked up forty four democratic votes in the process well but this president wants to go\nBeyond that like Ronald Reagan just as you enter as you said earlier\nWho really unleash prosperity with the series of tax cuts President Trump wants us\nTo ah to advance in past ten percent a cut focused on the middle class and here's his thinking\nLook the middle class you know they make too much money to get all the government help they don't make enough to really um live comfortably while you're always the ones getting squeezed to his funniest can't we do more for them and my answer is yes we can and so uh in what a contrast think about this so the Democrats want to repeal the tax cuts\nAnd a new report by Heritage Foundation says\nThat'll cost each middle class American uh twenty seven thousand dollars and an extra taxes and lost wages so contrast that ... every everyone in America right at twenty seven thousand dollar check to was you\nKnow you don't have versus a president who wants more tax relief for middle class families is there is there a clear contrast between that\nWhat it could not be more clear it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair he's a Republican district ... the great state of Texas from the ... it was interesting about it is\nThe sales job on the left is if you Brady and you Trump do this and if the Republicans do this it's going to hurt the deficit expert actually ... years they ignore the deficit bronco Obama doubled deficit by ruining the economy\nIn in in by the way President Obama and Democrats they added two trillion dollars to the national debt in one year and when you were taking less than that over\nA decade and we invest it in a brand new tax code in in tax relief for families and small businesses in a redesign so that American companies can compete and win anywhere in the world it's honest and smart investment and by the way what what the liberals won't tell you\nAnd so that American companies can compete and win anywhere in the world it's very modest and smart investment and by the way but what the liberals won't tell you is our federal revenue in the Washington hit a record high this year\nWe actually have more revenue for individuals in payroll taxes a hundred and five billion than we did before\nTax reform and so look we won't know for many many years whether the the new um tax code has actually fully paid for itself what we do know is\nIs that new revenues are coming in into or the federal government that our economic growth and opportunities is helping every American and I always like to point this out the difference you if you if you're worried about the Washington have enough money\nThe difference between that really slow Obama less than two percent growth and the three percent growth sings President Trump and more\nIs forty four trillion dollars in extra federal revenues when we are growing the economy you know so I'm I'm convinced that if we hadn't you know had tax reform our deficits would have been much greater overtime\nAids Kevin Ware the house ways and Means Committee chair but when can this go into place the president has has said it's going to be first week of November it sounds like it might happen the day or two before the election what's gonna happen\n... here's what we're talking about before he went onstage about when we might introduce it when he might bring the resolution to the floor and we're talking about could we do it in the next few weeks but in truth what he wants us to do is to have this ten percent middle class cut ready for him\nAnd when Republicans hold the house and Senate ... introduce it in the new um\nA Congress and pass it than his point is let's make sure every American understands only one party is fighting for their pocketbook\nI can talk to you for three hours or let me let me grab one more quick question before I let you go Kevin always appreciate the access thanks for having me we\nAlways appreciate it All right so the midterms you just talk to you just intimated that house in the Senate looks to me and again people have to stay engaged in our site has to go out and vote and I sit in their hands and be happy that their paycheck is bigger go ensure that is going to stay that way and go and vote but it seems to me that two maybe three some say four seats\nCould be gained in the Senate but the house is still a toss up ... the Democrats are backing off of that whole blue waves they can actually what what did you tell me before we started the interview they're actually saying we're not watching the numbers\nCame on course they are what's been happening especially in ... you see their voting rights\nAnd and you watch how Senator Cruz has really kicked in back in the gear and sort of feel that pulled the curtain back on that Aurora now more Texans realized just how extremely liberal he is always\nFar left ... basically as a Bernie socialist guy with open borders and and and the fact he actually said Kevin not too long ago that we that we recently took capital Mexico we just took it\nYeah I have um oh here's the guy who voted against repeatedly that Hurricane Harvey disaster relief right that's so much of our state was desperately waiting for eye in and I read his excuses about say there is no excuse or is it for for\nDownhill on a mortgage has he wanted some something unrelated attached to it or else he wouldn't do it and and your rights thank goodness we have the majority is because of this would not pass intended bunch of people like Jim Ted\nCruz lead and I'll tell you wish you could be me joke 'cause\n'cause ... Sen Cruz a was was hugely helpful\nAnd important on tax reform on Hurricane Harvey relief in ready to mandate so I'll just tell you he is delivering for Texas in a big way and I think look in the house we have our backs to the wall history says we don't uh keep the house like a lot of tough races in the day I Believe we do because because Republicans and conservatives\nAre now turning out and understand this\nIs it in the day I Believe we do because because Republicans and conservatives are now turning out and understand this is not a mid term this is really about you know keeping this house the Senate this economy this president in place\nIt's our house ways and Means Committee chair Kevin ... Republican the great state of Texas Kevin my right to appreciate the time was talked so thanks so take care okay All right back after this and the Joe ... writer\n\nPaul [noise]\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well complicated especially as the weather begins to cool well one person sleep soundly the other is either freezing or way too hot", "show_name": "James T.
