like Democrats always do which is what they live for\nThey didn't stop and say wait a minute are all three of these guys Jewish\nBecause if all three of these numbers these are the top three Democrats money people by the way which is why he named them\nAnd he said and it didn't stop to say I am I going to be called an anti Semite because all three of these guys are Jewish so then you could stop and you could check it\nAnd your father George Soros is Jewish\nAnd helping out is just a little bit when he was a child and Michael Bloomberg the billionaire thirty five billion dollars or say he's he's

impeachment\nAnd the father is Jewish\nAnd I was ... hedge fund managers are good when they're left is right [noise] right and then that critics\nSuch as the Anti Defamation league have been some of the blame on President Trump and his allies for encouraging dangerous behavior and their political rhetoric\nThat's they're encouraging dangerous behavior or by the way the Anti Defamation league was taken over by an Obama administration official who is a political apparatus check\nAnd he's not a legitimate a DL later he is a Democrat Party operative\nPeriod full stop so when the news media go to the aid the L. A. formally respected organization now just another adjunct of the Democratic party they know that they're getting their statement from an Obama administration official\nAnd I've got more Obama administration official this morning too but first let's go to sick highland been over here this is a Sigmund Harlem and I believe that's his name as friends go on sick is a sick high within four short\nHearsay type is for the left and he's got for jobs they pay millions of dollars on Showtime and NBC and he's a smearing snarling mal content is malevolent or his ... his ... am words he was on the television this morning and he was talking about the president of the United states\nAnd and they love there are still hung up on this the president says I'm a nationalist and then he explained what he means by national I Want our economy I Want our trade deals I Want our military I Want America to be first which is what the president of France the prime minister of France would say or anyplace else\nBut they said oh yeah a Hitler called himself a nationalist\nHitler called himself a socialist too but that doesn't seem to rub off on Bernie Sanders or on Alexandria Ocasio Cortez who didn't grow up in the Bronx but grew up in Westchester County and as lied about everything and she's as dumb as a stump she's almost as dumb as Mika Brzezinski but not quite\nSee Harlem and this morning summing up his view of the president of the United states\nThe president of the race in these other to demagogue he how that they can do that is after the ... national a taker and all the stuff we said\nYeah he obviously condones anti Semitism any soaks up nationalist hatred and what is a nationalist hatred\nAnd what that is the right people from other countries I guess is that what it is that I'm I'm not entirely sure I'm sick high women he's ah he's on the team he's one of the boys they are the problem of course is it's not them they're not hate filled they're not angry there\nNot sowing the seeds of discontent and on MSNBC demo team named James Hodgkinson did not go to a baseball field to mowed down the Republican Congress said none of that was inspired by them\nOr or the Southern Poverty Law Center it's always the other guy it's the other ... the other crap you remember that uh this is is it's it's Trump and Fox News they're at war with Fox News because they don't see him from the party sheet music\nOut what happened that Fox News without the Fox news on top of the Republican Party what happened to it is they were both corrupt bankrupt his two sons that were hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump they'd been taken\nThe Republican Party what happened to it is they were both corrupt banker of institutions that hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump they've now been taken over by Donald Trump I Know of course much worse much uglier place and they were five\nYears ago ten years ago ... years ago they were in pretty ugly places back then for throwing much we're place now I don't I don't\nKnow why anybody would show up at a baseball field and start shooting Republican if you're an MSNBC fan I don't know why the hostility see the geo pay the Republicans were a corrupt and bankrupt institution before Trump came along but then he took the Republicans the entirety of the Republican sixty some odd million people\nTo a very dark and scary place and and then there's the Obama and the other the dehumanizing again I'm pretty much shocked\nThat some leftist doesn't literally shoot at President Trump\nEvery day of the week the way these people spread hatred and I got I don't know how many Republican members of Congress have to be shot may political assassination attempt all this stuff but white partners yet as treated us nothing and honestly the news media is passive approach to all of the violence that we've written witnessed over the last two to three years\nHas fueled it and they're turning a blind eye to the white powder to James Hodgkinson to MSNBC Israel to Rachel Maddow Israel\nTo the political violence violence of antifa ... to the political violence against the police which has inspired by the Democrat Party\nThe news and Brock Obama specifically the news media turns a blind eye to all of that they tamped that down for the Democrats none of that becomes a part of the public a discussion and only violence that is perceived to be coming from conservatives is is focused on\nA embellished by the news media and so on\nSaying Harlem and the dehumanization program\n... not even a question of whether it's presidential behavior not not only human behavior in these circumstances any effect that it has on his followers on his ... his base is of course [noise]\nAnd dangerous [noise] of course\nThat's right the demo to cause the followers in the Denver teams are the real problem and the big problem of course across America is a right wing terrorism\nNot a ... he used to be a a and they love this white nationalist thing this is something that I've latched onto like a pit bull and they're not letting go\nAnd they've got a job because of the sickness brought in by people from the caravan\nNo dog whistle here uh when Donald trial these are these are ... or a fog corn he's blaring it out [noise] he he wants the white nationalist to know that he's on their side\nHe's like a New York business billionaire white nationalist from queens white nationalist they they Jean Davis up out of whole cloth and they pedal it every day\nAnd then they invited this miscreants on by the name of ... Miller who looks like a vampire like a transgender vampire actually and ah he's a strange kind of creepy little man that you wouldn't leave alone with the kids\nFor a minute he's of course an Obama administration official who was there a propagandist\nAt Loretta Lynch is State Department when all of the corruption was going on of spying on their political enemies and all this stuff\nSo that's why NBC pays this person Matt Miller again a Democrat Party apparatus chicken they bring 'em out and they treat him like he's an objective arbiter decided was a former government official they don't ... mentioned that he's a Democrat Party\nSpokesman in ... they they say is like a Justice Department official for really for who like a career person\nThat party spokesman in ... they they say is like a Justice Department official for really for who like our career person no he's a political rancor and the guy is unbelievable but he put his finger on the problem in America\nIt's clear now there is a serious for right wing domestic terrorism problem in this country\nShould I start playing the audio again Shai by the end chief of audio do we have the police being shot audio in Texas in Baton Rouge\nOr do we have the funerals from New York then we have James Hodgkinson shooting up the ... the problem is well there there was the completely benign non lethal the so called bombs are which are a perfect parallel for the white envelopes\nAnd uh and they don't see it that way 'cause they're not aware of of these things they have new timers Matt Miller he's a Democrat\nPet something the Justice Department and the department of homeland security have to address up but there is a problem for for them they can address it when the president United States the head of the federal government is a cheap propagandist for these right wing movements\nI didn't give you a lot of time so to speak\nThe carrot and yeah I mean I'm an immigrant okay make twenty six years ago a good bet it did all the health checks and all that sort of stuff I mean just as the other stuff is based on logic most most a lot of countries that have a fairly equal society\nIt is everybody gets better it is now the buttons\nYeah well that's you know you're a reasonable person were living an unreasonable times on where you have a lot of unreasonable actors in the conversation in and out of the media in and out of politics and I'm a I'm very concerned about the vulture culture that we are becoming an\nWhat an awful country we're becoming these days\nThe levels lock your money make over ... money manager life on what ...

how are you\nI'm doing well do you think of it taking my call sure man what's up in your world\nWell uh my wife and I really sat down and realize that we're on a bad road for future and decided to really take control of our finance that life and [noise]\nJust calling to see things get would light from you we recently found some stuff on line and had a friend who just that we watch some of your guys videos and ... on line there from there and so you know you step into right now we are currently saving for baby steps one\nAnd we have a total bit her loan and consumer credit card debt of Seventeen thousand nine hundred dollars [noise] uh my question is I'm including in that Seventeen I went ahead and rolled in our\nSecond mortgage that we purchased on the home we just moved into in that total two thousand one hundred and thirty five dollars go\nIn my mind um from what I've learned in South not working that's on calling it was should a role in that second mortgage the reason why I think that is because that's been lower um our bills once I pay that off\nTo your your second mortgage it'll two thousand dollars\nA year or so my wife and I just recently got into her second how\nYou know a guy so crude ones they'd be able to two thousand dollar second mortgage yes it's part of your debt snowball and baby step to\nOkay good I was just curious I wasn't sure if that would be the best way to continue to attack is to have your sailing through for a week or two daughters\nYeah if it's if it's under half your annual income on a second mortgage we always suggest you put it in your debt snowball and a man that's an unbelievably small ones so thank you congratulations well done and I mean just knock it out and I'm I'm Glad you're attacking this it's going to work for you\nDebbie is with us in Anchorage, Alaska Hi Debbie welcome to the ...\nUm I had a question about whether it would be wise and maybe that's got to get back to refinance our house to pay a credit card\nOffer in twenty four hours with no commission and no closing costs with no repairs Gert now do you buy all types of real estate yes Joe you name it\nWe buy wild card that's amazing you are going to have them in offering twenty four hours or you can list their property if they need top dollar right yes Joe that is correct ... that is the best of both worlds spell it or listed I Love it yes Joe we also worked with buyers to find them the perfect place but\nDon't wait because interest rates are going up ... my real estate man into Sunday you Joe I appreciate that although I Love your show\n... called courage digital realty executives buy two oh nine five four fifty eight hundred again by two oh nine five four fifty eight hundred for all your real estate needs\n... your mid term election destinations they should be one of the wind cake you th music on the news and talk\n\n\nI\nPhones a AAA eight to five five two to five books is with us from Pensacola, Florida Hi Brooke welcome to the ... high Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nMuch for taking my call uh my wife and I were moving out to a ... station out there or we have a a courthouse here in Pensacola and um I Know you normally not to buy a house if you're in the military um but uh [noise] make good money last two times I've done it\nBefore they pulled out of three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch up on retirement investments should ah you know at two twenty five ... and now I can afford something up there with how much do you have in on retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. non retirement down by about a half million dollar house then yes or what's\nYour household income or about one eighty [noise] okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible\nAppreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing and you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I wouldn't either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and on retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash\nOr non retirement cash and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred and when you sell it you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego\nThat's about the ... I mean Hawaii Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper in the San Diego I think we all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing and buy a less expensive home maybe a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does that make sense yes or the\nIt's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non retirement cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the for hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nIn non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years uh but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of ...\nOr that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nUh but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\nUh I I own my own business and I'm a try to figure out how not to be a crime and under orange is the one I'm ... years old but ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you need to start or retirement and I guess I\nDo you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money freed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA band around a lot I average probably right about a thousand only [noise] okay\nSo somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and out are you a thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no effect good for you or you're single okay okay does your wife work outside the home yeah you're a nurse what does she make\nA right about that and get all kinds of All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a thorough three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do a Roth IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just 'cause you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else said do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your long term investing in your ... in your Roth

that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you move closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right there so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year or kicked down about the time you saw the light at the end the Donald income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for your cars six and a half\nAnd a good um I think for me the hardest part was\nI'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see the hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper for you to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and\nUm so I think when we paid off our first student loan um that was just such a victory feeling for us um so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kinda flow out wherever to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to the\nYou know I think for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know the world we live and just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying the nice things and I'm just constantly you know talking ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can live like no one else and I really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted but\nI'm to be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so\nNear free you know those are the ... last three hundred pounds [laughter] it really does because he has a lot of that yeah it's pretty incredible ... well I Know it was a long time and a lot of sacrifice was worth it Yes sir yes that was back into no no\nNo no we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow I'm we're on babysat for well at the beginning steps to babysit for but we're wanting to save up to cash flow for a minivan\nLiver not say that but during the ...\nChanges you're going through his good good for you guys like well congratulations to you have more church leaders are more detractors as you went along um\nHad a lot of cheerleaders yeah we were um really supported by our family and our friends especially once we started getting the ball rolling and paying off dead it was kind of just people were in disbelief that we were able to pay off so much and um\nAnd at the same time he went to the big things for us with our journey was um being smart with our money especially all the extra income that was coming in and things like that but we also wanted to still I'm available lord in use our money for him and so\nI'm a lot of you know for the first few years a lot of our money was going out not towards that end we felt okay with that and so that's just part of our journey for people to not be afraid to still be generous while you're on baby step to even if it's a huge lump sum because the lord bless us in so many ways when we um\nI mean we've kept both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another car payment we're at the point to where we literally it was we were out\nAnd I mean we've had both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another car payment\nWe're at the point to where we literally it was we were outgrowing our car like with the car seat he couldn't even put a seat back all the way\nLike sitting out but we're we're getting a very high and that so probably write stories my parents they blasted us and gave us they're paid off as TV oh wow yeah so um you know that's just one of the main you know blessings that and um you know where it's given\nThat given to you they give it the grandkids [laughter]\nYeah yeah it's\nJust been incredible

that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other are probably some books some stuff too but we're pretty close there so twenty thousand dollars a year as what you need to earn\nIt there and minimum wage doesn't do that unless they're sounds like you need a new job [noise]\nAnd I have an opportunity to start a whole family family name brand clothing at me now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo they don't need to get into that you have a job you need a job you need to so you can make more you can make 'em Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing you can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs or other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way\nUm you are going to be working all the time though and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semis self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever\nUm and you\nUh\nYou can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and got a clash and that's all you're going to do what you can make it if you do that\nThe other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there\nParticularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you okay kind of an indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that actually planning on working at an ... they will forget all life can't lend it out like that in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you couldn't control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds to me like you're a rock star thank you and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter]\nThink you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars in student loan debt you don't need to it\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that go talk to that hospital administrator at the local hospital just set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place there's a kind of you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the way needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nAre very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task that's in front of you but you're on your way\nYou know get get some people on your side helping\nYou accomplish this um this task that's in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this Greg is with us in Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\nDave thank you for taking my call how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I just have a question for you I'm On a way out our I've talked to oil and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception all of our house\nUm we do at least our cars and um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that I reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation um ... chair\nThe main question that I have is we have um\n[noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with\n'em too off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing ah she has four one K. I have a four one K. actually has a pension I'm as well and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage um bought our house by about\nTen to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and you're dead free except your emergency fund then I Will put the everything above that towards the house till the house voted off\nSo take your income sounds point one five make sure the total of all the Roth IRA version four one\nK. contribution you're doing is history that I'm not ready to them that much greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit and throw the balance of our service not up to that as you get it up to that because we're the balance of the house and I'm Lynn we suggest you're listening to all forms\nResident gum aggressive growth and international\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back\nYeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my incomes going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm a I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now your back\nIs that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Claire how are you\nA good Dave how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we can all your data sets for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on I had on retirement but we are behind on college savings for two kids show how old are your kids you\nAre they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement\nI'm a little over a million over your head\nCongratulations ... billionaires so what's your household income\nDefinitely feel that way but yeah we\nAre I mean when you have one without million dollars you're millionaire yeah okay yeah you're you're right [laughter] [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income a little over two hundred okay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got to you\nA little over two hundred\nOkay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get have plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well what are you paying for brown to how much cash how much ... than a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred I mean one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point I yes nine so\nI I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement\nYou don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent ahead side so we're talking about thirty thousand under such fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say some college you say ten\nGrand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until they go to school don't have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you do that ... day Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area\nThe people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together and pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase retirement beyond Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan we lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this\nAnd that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids that's plenty granted if that's what I mean you've got is where you are so good questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Donald's on Twitter at Dave Ramsey\nAt Dave Ramsey I guess what you're
