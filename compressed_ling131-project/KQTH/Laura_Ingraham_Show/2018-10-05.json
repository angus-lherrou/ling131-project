K. and uh you know four and a and it could be paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now that's yeah\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral is part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the question is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOK inside of the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it's like no they would've offered the dog that credit card\nSo I mean in dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing today I got to require retirement OK\nI'm here about a year ... and I'm a ... and then I'll have a four week Kay all the\nWay to good mhm I quickly there are at sixty two would be better to file for Social Security in weight while before it goes on for we have for retirement have [laughter]\nCan run the math out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at it\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it say those words if you're white from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking out their four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh definitely yeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety according to the stat tables right now\nAnd so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nUm I I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask you a question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dream or I guess for a free spirit as you would say from listening to your show addict now for the last two weeks\nI Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money she's the saver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd um I've we've set aside step one we've done a thousand now we've put aside the shaving she wants to say more than that but [noise] she I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um we paid off to credit cards\nAnd we paid off on the credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me is about down the road is my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got\nAbout ... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over a book and there\nIs this I started to read that I haven't read it\nWas totally makeover has every detail about the seven baby steps

we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay I Want you to do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say that that was in dollars if you've already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except for home busting your desk\nLaws you attack those was caused by getting rid of those that famous now you've got the ability to invest in rural\nBy getting rid of

more in the style chick I was thinking this morning about the neighborhood I grew up in and you know\nAs you get older you don't remember the bad stuff all you do is you remember the good stuff and so it's very ideal like in your mind it was an idea like neighborhood it was incredible it's full of kids\nAnd we were always doing something you ever get a ... a piece of plywood out and put a couple of bricks up under it and go across it on your bike like evil Knievel you're jumping and it didn't go well and you go over the handlebars I mean have you ever done stuff like that and we'd anymore no much\nI mean we play baseball we play football we spent a lot of time arguing about the call 'cause we we'd we'd always argue about whether somebody was out of bounds we played and played and played and played and played run in and out of each other's houses and one mom always had some lemonade when mom would always have some\nBaloney sandwiches I mean it was a great neighborhood and I remember being a little kid and some of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man I Want to go\nA grade with a number on it I'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy then\nAnd when back when I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school and and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right they own the school right and so you're like man\nIf I could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be though I'd be ruin the school man I'll be happy then\nThen you finally get the sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school or middle school which was seven eight nine the school I went to\nAnd I thought man if I could just get out of six gringo over there in middle school you know they've got they've got P. E. they've got football they got cheerleaders cheerleaders they guy lockers\n\nGlad you are here but NASA and Miami, Florida Hi Vanessa how are you\nSaid I'm wanting to fall thanks for taking my call sure what's up a few years ago I resigned our children for Florida prepaid college\nPlan and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and defense than our income has gone down and we added another child\nAnd we've gotten into a credit card debt and we have a car loan now and\nWe can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without penalty should we do that or should we pay off our debt and leave that money and continue contributing to their prepaid plan\nHow much is in there [noise] um about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car we have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards all five thousand\nOkay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe started at ... and that's and I realized we did that and he's got that an orderly having that\nPeter Pan pre played pan and then I don't know what to do at this point gotcha okay I'm In your household income as well\n[noise] um has been explained five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency\nA no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price to twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right\nSo how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving a growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time minded\nAnd so are you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run\nCollege plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I don't want a better rate of return all my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your eighty six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called a vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a\nA ... I was going through a few for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ...\nTo my question because this is a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen or we were my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd a habit struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom [laughter] and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and then that's the only reason west Texas is struggling or on our oil prices are so far down that there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon it was a boom baby I mean\nBut uh and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell although it all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's essentially a they're looking at the three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you're just added on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is is what I mean I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business as if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much uh\nOh there is only would I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars powdered milk kitchen table would I go go by what rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I think you know that you wouldn't die and I actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know what we're afraid the stock market crash yeah well\nIt might but I got to start getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes yeah we're hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all persons to know that now uh so what I Would\nDo a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n[noise] you know this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father make it to say oh I see\nSo it's a just a day and they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nI probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death so phone ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that\nDefinitely not some advisers that of families entire portfolio three million dollar networks\nWe caught up in ... [noise] um\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me as a financial coach I knew that I Would say no [noise]\nSo I I Would take the majority or\nMoney off the tides thanks for calling in

want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nAnd um so it has to be a our income and our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall net worth and so there are toy it's just a toy that happens to go up in value and both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and I still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nThen you know going in and the you know the the
