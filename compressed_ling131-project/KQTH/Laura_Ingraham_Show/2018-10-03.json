MORNING joke with the pitching sisters\nI'm there he's telegraphing because these are the Democrats you don't have to wait for the Democrats on the hill these are the Democrats\nAnd what they're arguing now is well this FBI investigation will be declared inadequate and we will declare Nolan void and it will not affect our thinking or votes or rhetoric\nOr anything else we're going to continue the blood drenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man who has been slime by the filthy is gang of gangsters fly balls in the history of American politics I think where the guy and this and my best girl was sitting there this morning\nAnd we're listening to it and I a lean forward a little bit and I think my best girl said oh here it is here it is the ground is shifting here it comes to have you ever had\nPulled up the idea that investigation Jeff Flake and Chris Coons and others teamed up was to give her perhaps to Republicans they love we looked into this but independent third party investigative body [noise]\nGive them coverage to vote yet they say they clear judge Kavanaugh will now by not interviewing doctor for it and not healing judge Kavanaugh as part of the FBI inquiry as Dan Goldman that it's not really a full FBI investigation they inquiry\nNow you're giving opening to Democrats and other people say well this wasn't a real investigation so how can you possibly though yet and I'm certainly not going to change my vote from no faith than anything that comes out of it\n[noise] what are you saying he speaks for the entirety of the Democratic party as well as anyone else um is that they've already declared the FBI investigation to be a inadequate\nThey're going to want to extend it until next year some time special counsel two and a half years later\nA it's not about getting to the truth I'm it's just not about getting to the truth and all they have an interview Kevin on Fort they're pretending it's over and they haven't done in the news media is insisting that the FBI do with the news media wants them to do otherwise the news media won't tell them that they've done an adequate job\nNow it's a Lynch mob a and\nUnfortunately Lindsey Graham is Atticus Finch willy ...\nThe whole week long pause with the post and get some clarity to it yes it while I'm afraid my leading out the two key witnesses although they did testify under oath before the Senate only clouded further and make them more controversial when the vote finally comes up later this week\nNow they're talking about jumping the gun and uh you know little learning is a dangerous thing\nUm they've declared I guess the FBI investigation to be over because they read something that said that it might have ended as soon as Tuesday Afternoon or Tuesday evening the FBI has not indicated that it's over\nAnd I'm ... and they're just saying what they're they're ... they're muddying the FBI investigation ahead of time and that's what they're doing a Lindsey Graham let's go to well let's go there they are\nThey are laying down the predicate here to oppose whatever the FBI comes up I tend to dismiss it and say well that doesn't change we need more investigation more investigation and it is at that point that you will know that they are a lot I mean if you have an wised up yet you're probably hopeless\nBut at that point you should know that you're just being hoodwinked you're there fraudsters right number seven Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham yesterday he might be the Atticus Finch of this Lynch mob story\nCan look at it and then we're

TALK\n\n\nLove your show him with us from Montana\nHow are you\nYour social it better than I deserve what's up\nI'm let me just lay down the situation will quicken I'll get to the question about okay okay [laughter] uh\nPresumably the job I have I make like twenty two three year um me and my wife have gone into a three hundred and forty two dollars and\n... what do you do with their care professional you're a what\nA direct care so I take care of people who are ah developmentally disabled and work on behavioral stuff\nAnd you make twenty two thousand dollars a year ... okay\nSo ah\nBasically I have an opportunity to locate from where I Am in Montana back to Boston which is where I'm from\n... and the single job would be a double my income mhm [noise]\nIn doing so I Would not be bringing my family\nA foundation to ...\n... dollars to start paying off our debt I mean right now I'm dealing with like negative cash flow\nRight does your wife work outside the home\n[noise] uh no she can't care for is you have four kids okay yeah All right and do you own a home in Iraq okay\nAnd uh so basically you get a loan your furniture into a U Haul and pull it across the country and be in Boston and get an apartment right\n[noise] um well I'm a long haul yes but short term I Would try a plane ticket why not load your wife up and go\nOut and have the money to put them all on the part of uh-huh\nOkay so uh you're going to be making twice as much though so how quickly would you be moving them\n[noise] ah well she's pregnant with our fifth so the thought process would be in the summer probably August after birth\nOh I'm not doing that I'm not leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the dead gum world and go live with your dad not a chance unloading her up and moving dude\nAs you're well can you can have your family help you a little bit I mean it won't cost much to get moved maybe the employer would give the new employer will give you an advance to get you moved into your new apartment\n\nUm there's a possibility with that yeah you need a load up your family and get out of there\n\nBut you know not being with your pregnant wife while she's carrying what your fifth child you're in Boston and she's in Montana dude that is not okay [laughter]\nI mean you're not in the military you're not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad choices now you need you need a scribe together a few dollars and go deliver some pizzas or something in a for a month and and pile up you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you a U Haul and get your button gear\nAnd enroll loan over to a Boston and take that job or moving with your dad for a month with the whole dead gum crew over there if you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going\nTo lay bringing your whole family and while your wife is ... no no no\nThat's not going to work out for you that's going to end poorly I'm going to assure you may links for calling in ban is one of those bands in Colorado Springs have ban how are you\nYeah you do better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and um we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide and art but they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysat\nI'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan that you know because I'm self employed and money isn't always the air I Need to have a you know two two months or so or income to fall back on\nIn ... to be able to make the budget that does your wife work\nLike she does not she's a stay at home mother\nAnd so you're not making any money in the real estate business\nWell I'm I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year so more in there\nThey are not having you know ... months\nNot any zero months there during the winter in Colorado there's um some months at a slower than others\nNot any zero month or during the winter in Colorado there's um some months at a slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter in ... I'm\n... now and I don't I don't I never expand baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call in an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it an Illinois valley account\nThe Helmand valley is the volatility of your income the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow a analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars a real estate business I can imagine you have in some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues and charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay set some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have\nA volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I had a great impact on changed my life five years ago um do you think you are currently uh I I got a ... question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my hum do you get a net worth of a half million dollars um [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture I was I was making an average salary for what I did I went to a competitor I was much more\nAre you making um I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year\nWhat do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year and your questions what\nAm I my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work and um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse in the marketplace this idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIndication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse than the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with so maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you probably find somebody with a decent fulcher and how you what's your worst that's one of the mouse to\nRamp [noise]\nDid you know statistically when it comes to life insurance from protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the

accounts are all have local uh read our regional and um\nAn ... an hour a personal accounts are all have local\nUh read our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talk to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and\nThey over charging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated\nThey're not that good they're not good at anything\nSo I just don't get it so that that's why we endorsed\nCredit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank and I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and I kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but\nYou know ... you know in most of these cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing\nJust the same how can I help\nAll right well thank you and your staff right you're doing it it's a blessing you um how will be needing a life saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I uh I should continue funding NHL stay with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks here first I just put a that extra money into a Roth IRA or four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year the company I don't know who you can put you come out they're matching a couple hundred bucks a year and more okay show\nThe the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what does it\nNeed to liver ooh I got the so yeah ... fortunately if you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know [laughter] oh [laughter] okay hobby I'd say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they've estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay yeah I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to yeah retire early you know if I\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you you you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in an investment to cover what is going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um and I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is a guessing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably yeah\nYeah and so I'm thinking we're gonna time retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last what two years or something\nFor ... or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last what two years or something\nUm you can keep that indefinitely so I I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of those I don't want to\nTime that poor like a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year end of that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what's your ducked double\n[noise] um\n[noise] ... yeah you or whatever that adoptable is on the ... year\nOh now that age I say that health insurance I Know of fun I don't\nKnow the edge essays are health savings account that is attached to a health an H essay health insurance policy that has a ... policy\nIt it depends uh depends on the policy I picked it either six to nine nine thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nAnd that would be six thousand happy Irish I only caught that yes and I don't touch it until I you know pre higher\nYes here's why out when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you keep your health insurance in place and you've got this big\nJuicy health savings account sitting there in and I use mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as a ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver\nTransplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on no penalties\nAt sixty five and so um\nYou're going to want to build that up and you just not going to ... it becomes over what you don't use you can use for retirement\nThe

that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month he a\nGood answer you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap what this thing but usually you're not going to have that month than a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor ... you know you don't have\nAnything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going I don't have\nAnything budgeted for car repairs\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to win something on the car and the given six month period of time it might be tires it might be maintenance that might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on my car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regards\nSo probably gonna add a little bit of a done it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up\nAs a sinking fund they call it than the every dollar software or in them on below but I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you uh have the money in cash than for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did find just cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully you won't have another one of those and you you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThey appreciate you're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nThank you [laughter] I'm honored ... we've been together a long time you and I [laughter]\n[laughter] so question for you so my wife and I we have about three hundred and ... and student did another hundred and Fifteen and automobile than a line of credit that type of thing there's about four Fifteen\nAnd and didn't did another hundred and Fifteen and automobile that line of credit that type of thing so I was about four Fifteen\nAnd you know we make a pretty good income shootout about one twenty annually I met one eighty three hundred come on a question for you it I wasn't going back to school and get my master's programs only twenty five okay so I feel like that would be a very real are why on it\nBut over the last three days are starting to think maybe maybe I shouldn't [laughter] just want to get your take on that\nA masters in one\nOh it would be in software engineering Mm okay\nAnd that would increase your income by more than twenty five K\n[laughter] it would probably be hard to say I'm there wouldn't be a winning case and we raised as the category of jump into\nMhm okay are you doing that you can get back into it might get back in touch over a year then from\nThat point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget is you make so stinking much money now you live in a very expensive area granted\nIt's crazy and can\nI ask you want to live in a really ... yeah but you guys are really you are really ...\n... ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that menu be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nBut you do you like know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare talk to me by buying anything else you bought enough crap for a while you need to do you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and\nGet this debt calling\nAnd in the process of doing that can you we've twenty grand or ... end of the budget sure\nAnd delays you buy\nMe that it's time to address this\nThis is the director of\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nAnd that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whatever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree or am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a\nRegular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you can get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to ... the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost\nIs the number one cause of student loan debt\nAnd what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck\nBoth or transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of ... to the mall and\nAnswer if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful ... wanna but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make a scholarship hunting your full time job\nAfter school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and writing the ...\nJob or after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarships forms and riding the essays and he probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school\nFor ... that'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written that's what they call it what is in RA\nHow it is it is a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be NRA if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships for somebody pays you to get there and then plan on working your butt off\nAnd those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nMr Ramsey how are
