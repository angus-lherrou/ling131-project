working at your home at Silverado every plumber goes through a full background Jen and most have at least ten years' experience when you have the professionals from locally owned Silverado bombing in your home you'll have peace of mind called six\nNine six zero zero zero zero that six nine six zero zero zero zero station\nThe caller for right now to Seventy five one level and one way or taking the money and marriage only four Seventy five one one more one on one one more one\nOne of those in San Diego high one welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDave how are you doing better than I deserve sir how can I help [noise]\nOkay so um [noise] I mean my wife we send me just\nThe one man or a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and we're not really a green aren't aware of this money should go oh my goodness won't happen where did you get a settlement that large from a I got in a pretty bad motorcycle accident ... how are you doing\nA A R A M I'm blessed to be here I Am actually\nYou're physically coming back\nA yes or my body recover great so I'm happy I can do just a little bit or I'm a movement issues in my shoulder but besides that I'm buying\n... you got any future surgeries coming up a no okay well good luck I'm Glad you're I'm Glad you're doing a good that's awesome okay same so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on\nSo me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but\nPerhaps some leftover but she's not agreeing with me with that mhm and I just wanted to your your opinion on what you think would be the better move\nThat's huh well she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter] but anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get it and we have about forty five thousand dollars\nAnd ... I Would pay that off and I would hold twenty back for an emergency and put the rest as your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that\nLaying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble and so on and so\nMy vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer to listen to make now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new list and I'm trying to get here on board mhm she's not really to come ... they are also having trouble getting her on board with the plan as well yeah\nI can imagine so um I\nHighly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement okay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we we have to we have a rule\nWe have to do nothing until we can come into agreement on large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nUh when I was there when I asked when I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mother would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the clients is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you OK because if you go by yourself it'll cause of divorce does you're going to get more and more and more and more\nExcited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two classes with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive\nBut uh but don't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pickup I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing gay\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good faith um\nBoth my wife and I are at Pew coordinators ... get free\nAnd we need your wisdom and guided something where we also have a little disagreement [noise] um last you see that her son got very we learned in Miami how come out really knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay um\nOh good money to help them out really knowing yeah knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay um\nWhy would you do that you're ...\nYou know what that's a good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year ago I\nTouch with every with that aspect of it but um we volunteered to pay for the material that they take a class which they did but in the end they didn't discipline Metallica our principles and or building a ... ... ... well\nAfter six months we decided that they weren't trying to make the U.S back anything we kind of let them you know we weren't alone and be more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication to indicate me on her famous back\nWell you know life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down and um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work this is where it gets sticky my 'em knowing that my wife ... parents trashed would be dispersing funds to all their fisheries recruited him we\nBoth agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would immediately pay us back when the checks in some of the logic was it they were a bar in Columbus and that they were already ... her parents stress\nAs it today we have not distributed that many but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here it's going to be distributed next couple of weeks\nWe wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a five or a a thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of ... will do rent the otherwise they'd be um evicted in our daughter live just does not want to work to help out\nSo my angle is there a settlement of mirrors and because we have not given distributed responsibility pain backyard alone I have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as that goes this is my wife's side\nThat my wife write the check to them have them come over and sided or just and we would write them a check for the balance of what they did ... how do we didn't we didn't read them and it seems simple and we know that if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptations them using a hundred and Seventy not ... agreed and be they might be more proactive to solving as soon as\nThey show that much from a non thousand dollars\nRight he Edie Henry you right now what's your network now what's that what's your net worth\nA ... [noise] I don't know five hundred six hundred what's your household income uh\nWho I'm thirty maybe\nOkay and the only ... here's my opinion this is all your fault\nMy fault yeah OK you loan money that we're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which was you loan family money right you're the one made this mess I\nOkay I take your job now and trying to correct that they're not making it worse\nYeah and so I'm\nWondering you could do you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot I should be given your money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right it she she believes that\nThat we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse us\n... or ... and that's my angle\nAnd then they'll reimburse ...\nEither ... or ... that my ... they're not going to have to leave leave ridiculous assumption that is not gonna happen\nYou mail a check them your number don't see this money and the other side of you to speak to your own children over money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money all your fault\nSo if you want to if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do this again\nIs absolutely ludicrous\nFor all the trouble you've caused caused every bit of this [noise]\nLet me tell you

I worked for the postal service they have a get a loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter]\nAnd um I have two friends one of them is I'm asking me to go for a business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend if I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I take one apartment he thinks the other\nAnd it's going to be of course with a mortgage lonely too so I wanted to know what should I Do\n... ... well we tell folks not to borrow money around here if\nYou listen to the show very much the shortest path to wells and peace in your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't sale\nSo um what that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest you say no because at the end of the stories are nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners or somebody to buy a house and then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his half or you don't pay your overcame a year and a half is a\nPrecursor to the ending of a friendship and a foreclosure\nSo no I wouldn't do either one of those and that's my reasoning\nI think you'll have a lot better life if you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without bet\nThey just start small\nWe started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nWell you figure out a way to get going\nAnd you what we call bootstrap it and it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt about subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology Thomas is with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up I'm I just graduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why\nI I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\n... well I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance companies correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through the end my last year of school I got very turned off the actuarial science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because every one kid everyone wants you to have experience and\nI don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did I did summer classes and they can't do internships for summer classes\nSo kind of what kind of went into a job or you try it into a financial analyst financial um\nWhat kind what kind of natural job or you tried into\n\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been even doing accounting like account Mabel any ... receivable [noise] you know entry\nLevel stuff or you just get your foot in the door I'm OK well\nHere's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this as well go to the ... show dot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes and applications without relationship or ...\nUm I'll give you an example uh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year\nWe had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those moderate hires you get lost in that room and it's\nNot that I don't want to answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable and so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are\nEver but we would give him an interview and pull their pull their resume out of the stack you got to get out of the pile you know\nAnd so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that she married a kid plays soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that'll put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired an almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you can get on something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them\nAnd you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify investment or looking for at least we'll talk to them and get the resume out of the pile if somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and listen to the kids on the show he'll help you and all this stuff is very gracious false out there but I think you can leave some\n\n\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your longer money goes boy doesn't\n[laughter] but this is an amazing story very well done thank you very well not well\nYou did exactly what I Try to get doctors to most dogs come out and go finally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole break in life mhm\nI deserve a new house a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy understood all you do would you you just kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought\nYeah 'cause now if I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred wherever you make it ... you're going to be unbelievably well for him so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one wow\nThis fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader\nOr I Would say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot about you and we're encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely own and it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAn other planets I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment yeah\nIt's going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later in the final payment\nYou know you pay them almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen minus taxes which takes a big chunk of and so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now are you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging\nAnd just completely lean to show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah Fifteen to twenty a month to only given month\nAt what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the ... which kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so they were to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that\nAnd then I started to have some more hope that I Would be able to pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there was no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you then again nobody was supposed to do unless you know that there's just going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is just to stop burning from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never got a day and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed the papers balloons you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income as much less oh sure they know what mine is but I learned most\nPeople's [noise] [laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that from my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card and um you know make sparked more purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles from them\nYou know there was a there was a sense of character that came from them that they cause you'll be able to do this that's what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good well I'm proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story we got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story\nAnd we want you to go and be a millionaire you'll be that in about twenty minutes and uh and outrageously generous as we go along well done very very well done\nTouch down April
