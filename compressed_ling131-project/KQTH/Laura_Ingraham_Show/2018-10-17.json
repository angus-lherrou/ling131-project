[noise] um well I work\nAs a truck driver and I'm never home so I'm On a blind eye was later in life retirement and I'm Wondering I'm would be a good idea and oh to invest that extra money to put out in Middle East now you know that's a\nGood good question how old are you a fifty fifty four near single okay and how many years do you think before you buy a house\nOkay All right cool\nWell as long as you've got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund or a series of them\nFor something like that I probably would just using this in the index fund because it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I've started to uh ... five hundred fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nAnd that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott and sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a a nurse and that that I'm Wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nI'm so my question is if they work for me to go to cool now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year and um so if I go to school it's going to cost me three years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a what do you make a year now are right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than on any out of pocket and can you live on her income while you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school uh but I don't think I can cash into thing right now because I I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr or putting and Lisa putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThat then you need to wait until you can pay for school I Would never in Thirty years are doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow it um I can see it pretty easily ... how long does it take to go through the class again or go to guy ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nOr thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't cash flow thirty granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA love note when I'm not in coal\nIf you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school\nI I I'm Sorry fifty thousand it it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year I thought you said it was Ninety thousand I'm Sorry I I got that wrong if they did sixty thousand a year\nSeems high yeah it it it is a it's a it's an expensive program yeah go to a less expensive program\nThat but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to pay for it if I usually\nGo you know there's certainly having all stocked stocked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student\nLoans whether they finish or not and then you've got what's known as a freaking mess and\nSo I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens dude and the last thing you want the only time debt works is if everything works\nOther than that that doesn't work\nAnd say wait till you to stay away from it thanks for the call\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua ... is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should file for bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all my debt off um that Nobel basically all my debts except my car are aimed collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating\nUm bankruptcy why are they only go actions\nUm they're like oh medical bills um one is that is a car that guy um brief oh the cause of a\n... I lost my job and that I think I think like a phone bill and then there too mhm\nOkay so how much is the repo bill\n[noise] um [noise] that one's actually [noise] only like a couple of grand ... it gets what I have on there is a nine nine thousand four hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment\nMhm how long ago was that three and a half years ago\nOkay and how ... how much how much my medical data began\nI Would say about two thousand\nAnd one of the doubt if you go\nTo the rest of it is it just makes the narrow like ... or ... I think that phone bill and always payday Lowe is well you know so\nYou're you're totally that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out mhm okay and what do you make it here\nI'm a little bit for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married older\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday\nThe happy birthday does she work outside the home\nI'm no she stays at home and takes care of her daughter\nOkay good well let me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that debt is not the problem is is a symptom of something else that's going on I'm right\nAnd it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment so your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if\nShe might do maybe I'm if it did that and make you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change their habits that causes this mess in the first place you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYeah there you know so we really need to get under that does bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably shuttle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you're saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh\nI've I've actually called them multiple out who are talking to you that was like one of the first video that I Will look it up with out of it that collect bears you know a ...\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand or three thousand you're still not bankrupt it's still about you getting control of your money and when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a problem

what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three bean before actually lives on to babysit for\nWas not a magic cancer of the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this if you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you're screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah\nEnd up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things and most people that means you know\nThree years four years something like that um but if you're if you're fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you in twenty eight on friday okay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two\nBut you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got a you know how to land a pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to return multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years been called that baby steps ... what I'm that's yeah that's kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nLike just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so the thirty years' old your your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for us not sooner and uh you will of saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multi millionaire you say I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is I thanks for stopping by thanks can't\nOpen phones AAA eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City Hi Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay\nI can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school but at the game the residency included\nI I decided to specialize um and uh\nDid you get a phone or what\nUm uh yeah I'm not certain is that what I Want to do yet I no no no I'm I'm asking how you did that\nOh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um wow I Am very very very appreciative of how\nGood you should be that's amazing wonderful so how can I tell\n'em yes away when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control this funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm so I'm\nA yeah I was I was given control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice my father who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's actually back in the rain stopped me or I Would like a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of money for a living expenses um and I've said that about five thousand dollars from\nSome small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and how that myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get through through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings um and the two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on three months renewal basis until I needed to take them out to pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds and a bond interest rates were yields a go\nGo down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in the bills you could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nOr as interest rates increase show that's not a very safe investment an environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type phones but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value\nAnd you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing And Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum or you've defeated your own purpose Detroit yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go toward something that's fun but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you\nEven though I'm great thank you so much for taking my call sure\nI I just wanted to thank you for all you do um this December will mark ... it's been seven years since my husband and I have paid off that I'm following their plans to go for that\nUm but my question today is um my sister and I were a little concerned about our parents' killer and hoping you could give us some advice on how they could got them um my parents live in North Carolina and they live in a flooded area of flood prone area\nAnd I'm so every time the hurricane come through um they they experience some flooding it on their on their property at their home as well as my dad business\nAnd we were
