worked with addicts for Thirty years but goes one hundred percent of the addicts end up broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy\nYour legacy your dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're gonna destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and he'd the help and\nFight to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that we see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and ah but gambling and sex are both just eggs the the\nPornography is a is a it has gone crazy because of the Internet the access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives in good ways in bad ways but the access in this case is causing\nExcess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you're you're just left without any authority\nStructure as a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to stump you when you grew up your life\nYeah I Do have some family on my dad's side I'm actually\nA good way but they know what's going on now so yeah\nThere were lots of problems going on like over a year ago a like a fact and that just a and I I never and whenever I tried it goes then they kind of they were like a cheesy oh you're just being a victim on this and I never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the leash and\nThat you know K. everyone's okay but\nThat's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they ... they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nI Know that all behaviors obviously have\nOkay or no help but they they they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian\nI also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment to treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be a half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for\nAnd there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know that um but um [noise] I I I don't know honestly I\nThink that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong how can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um the saw the last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPast store oh counseling to go with your other counseling get with some young guys in that church and become friends with some people who have some character\nHave some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect\nIsn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people in them so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a book\nOr synagogue I Know you're Jewish okay cool that's perfect then let's get one of the rabbi dude\nLet's get the spiritual element of those going because there's a there's an aspect of that that goes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your faith than wonderful on by caused the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with\nUm a lot and um so yeah I that's\nThe only thing I Know how to tell you to do because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realize this is ruining\nYour life and um you know\nThat I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in and I've got to put some structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a ... there's some\nCareful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom and that will be hanging out with good people are that are lifting\nYou up I'm obviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross so um but that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I'd\nReally lean into getting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's a group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you\nUm then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month those were the last night as a matter of fact and I'm fifty eight\nUm that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties and the other day and we also encourage them\nFifty eight um that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their\nTwenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed that they need a group\nOf guys you know what my friends the the man's bill calls a band of brothers in your life\nA talk with you in these situations so I'm a man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you um I'll pray for you to

in Dayton, Ohio hey Billy welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I are in the process of trying to consider buying a house the child who are running into is that we own to rental houses and we currently rent the one we live and then we don't want to take on more debt and he's so we're trying to figure out whether we should sell the rental properties or\nUm you know how to just sort of finagle that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have um what is one of these rental worth\n[laughter] well what are the challenges that we face it the rental properties are actually out of town on them on the military guy and we're currently living in Dayton, Ohio rental properties already Georgia in Virginia sell the um the value\nSell them yes I Would not long distance landlord okay\nNo that's your health and they were asking for trouble you need the money you're in the military are trying to buy a home and you need the money and you don't need to be alone you got you did not set out to own rental property everywhere these rental properties by default was not there you're not you're five your strategy to buy rental properties all over the United states\n\nToo that the inclination that I've been getting from a couple of folks that have been talking to my my only hesitancy though is that they've been successful I've had renters that have been paying the mortgage and um they seemed like there there's the possibility of it now valued going up\nAnd put them under the values go up but I'm also sure somebody's gonna change their hardly oil in your living room because you're out of town [laughter] this is going to happen I I I've got rental properties man I got a bunch of 'em I've on rental property for forty years and um you've got to be I I just\nDo any long distance landlord and I don't have any property that I ran out that is not in my town\nAnd you did not by not by these properties plan you ended up with them and you're trying to move on to the next phase of your life which is home ownership use your long distance landlord and you don't even own your own home I personally was so both of them are meeting like you do what you wanted because that's what I thanks for the call this\nSome are made it like you do what you wanted but that's what I [noise] thanks for the call [noise] this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get those question all the time they wouldn't it be smarter for me to sell my house myself the answer is really simple the typical for sale by owner home sales for one hundred and Ninety thousand dollars for the typical home sold by an agent is\nYou would have just move the debt over onto your house\nDumb idea eighty eight\nPercent of the time that people take debt con solid Asian loans out but don't change their habits and there were other debts back up the only time I tell people to move that into a debt consolidation is to avoid bankruptcy or for\nThey don't change their habits and they were in their debts back up the only time I tell people to move that into a debt consolidation is to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of those so I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt 'cause that's what banks do\nSo well is when a bank says hey I got a great idea what they're really saying is hey I think I can make some money off of you\nI mean really it's like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not it's not a pet it's a skunk so don't pet it\nLets you this is what you're dealing with or without a bank so no chase no no no no no Allen on Twitter says I just got laid off and I need to move my four oh one K. tomorrow ... should I go ahead and do that if I have a chance of coming back and working for the same company in the future\nI Would roll it to a regular IRA NATO Ross IRA because if you roll into a traditional area you have no taxes\nAnd unless you got a real power money and just want to pay those taxes right now I Would not converted to a rod but what role at to a traditional even if you're going back because that portion then at least as in your control you restart your four O. one K. is there's no advantage to having left your money back there no mathematical advantage of ignore advantage at all\nSo I Would take it\nWith me my accent in Abilene, Texas ain't Mike welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHey thanks for having me on short today better than I deserve talking to help 'em well you know you're burning question for you but now or shorter times

year now we recently gotten and you and\nNot really super financial savvy and trying to get our finances in order\nAnd now I'm Wondering we need to go and require house again into his team your note what's your interest rates are right now we're three point seven five\nNo and not need to refinance if you pay a ... a thirty year mortgage if you calculate it three seven five your mortgage balance today and and just put it in a calculator and come up with your Fifteen year payment\nAnd you know take your regular payment off of that not counting taxes and insurance okay take your principal
