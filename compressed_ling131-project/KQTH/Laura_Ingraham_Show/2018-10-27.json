getting lots and lots of phone calls an appointment about changes in Medicare just in our market so some people may be losing their plan\nAnd they've got to pick a new plan some people are seeing rate

the part B premium for two thousand Nineteen and of course lots of questions about how are my drugs going to be covered starting in January so we're really working closely with folks to make sure that they are going to be set for two thousand Nineteen\nKaren are there are lots of changes with the drug part of the insurance\nThere really are there are changes every year so I think people don't always understand that the drug plans can change so the way your plan may have coverage or medications last year may not be the fame moving forward and we always want to make sure we avoid any nasty\nSurprises moving in to the new year because this is the one time of year that you can make those changes to your plan\nRight okay good to know so Karen is the person to get a hold of their retirement evolution is I'm going to just give me your phone number out right now in case somebody does have questions Karen they can call you at five to zero three nine nine sixty three forty one\nAgain you can call care and you could ask her questions about Medicare and you can go and visit with her view like that any type of health insurance five to zero three nine nine six three for one they were going to be talking about what if\nWe live and tell one hundred years old and this was such a top I Am now so many people are living that long now isn't it amazing it's amazing in fact recently and Italian woman her name was Emma ma Renault died peacefully in a rocking chair at age one hundred and Seventeen\nShe was not sick she just passed away peacefully and not only listen to this was she the world's oldest person that em I was the last person to have been born in the Eighteen hundreds of crazy I think that's something that you wouldn't\n... and the changes that she has seen in her life [laughter] I mean she's basically seen to industrial revolution right to really have it\nYeah so that's what we're going to talk about today we're going to be talking about whether or not\nYou are prepared to live that long are you prepared to become a centenarian that somebody who turns one hundred years old\nSo care and you're going to help us by showing us ways we can prepare financially today for this possibility is it difficult Karen to encourage people that they need to prepare for something that's us far office may be living in ... well it can\nDefinitely be a challenging conversation because in the past we really looked at planning for retirement for about\nTwenty to Thirty years at the outside and and now we're looking at planning into a hundred or beyond so I certainly let people know that the odds of you living to be a hundred or increasing and you're going to face all kinds of risks\nOver the course of the lifetime you've got the risk of losing a home dying prematurely being disabled and unable to work being in a fender bender in your car the list goes on and on as far as risks that were exposed to but for people headed towards retirement or if they're already there living a long life sounds like a reward\nBut it also presents a genuine risk we in the financial business called longevity risk\nSo it's a really good idea for people to make sure that they protect themselves\nFrom the other risks that I mentioned right your car insurance you have homeowner's insurance those kinds of things but in retirement it's also a good idea for people to protect themselves from this longevity risk this chance that she'll run out of money if you live a long life\nSo we're really talking about here is building your\nOwn longevity insurance or your own longevity strategy because the fact of the matter is people are living longer\nAnd that means they may need to have more ...\nStrategy because the fact of the matter is people are living longer and that means they may need to have more money to fund that longer retirement when the last several decades\nMedicare and what's your sense of how well people are prepared for that possibility because it seems like for a lot of people the longevity risk is not going to be at the top of their concerns about retirement\nYou know you're absolutely right longevity risk out living your money basically is always top of mind for me I saw a study recently where only ten percent of the pre retirees age fifty plus who were surveyed said they are financially prepared for retirement last Thirty years\nMichael today it's to help change that and the minds of our listeners\nBut among the pre retirees that I talk to you every day I sensed they do think about their longevity and what it means for them financially if they live a really long time and if they're not\nI Would think knowing that number the size of the asset base that you need to carry your retirement it would mean projecting retirement expenses right\nAbsolutely you definitely need a realistic list of retirement expenses many of your day to day expenses could decline could even disappear\nOnce you retire so for example if you're no longer commuting to work every day your auto expenses may go down depending on where you live maybe you don't even need a car so those are things to think about if your house is paid off by the time you retire\nMaybe you don't have a monthly mortgage payment to worry about\nBut if we look at the other side\nOf that ledger and we calculate what you have what your network says that means adding up all the stuff\nA retirement account like an IRA four one K. your Ross an investment portfolio your stocks bonds if you have any of those that are individually held\nYour home or their real estate holdings argue a surge donor and a vacation home you and your siblings went in on those kinds of things do you own a business do you have insurance contracts and any other assets\nThat you may own some people we see may have specialized collections maybe guns or cars or Navajos blankets or something those all fall into the asset category\nAnd then we want to compare one side of the ladder\nTo the other the assets you have or you project to have a retirement versus the expenses you expect to have to go from there you can really figure out a strategy for continuing to build that asset pace and for how to ... spend down those assets sustainably overtime\nSo no doubt given all the factors that come into play in these calculations from inflation to the assumption is you have to make about investment growth rate since we're really makes sense to work with somebody who can coaches for somebody who can be your quarterback somebody who is a financial professional\nSo of course in our office we really believe that creating and then and the many and regularly revisiting a strategy for protecting your retirement nest egg presents a unique set of challenges and I think these are challenges that you don't necessarily want to put in the hands of just anyone\nAnd today Karen is offering you a chance to call in set up an appointment go in and visit with them at retirement evolution is this is a complementary customized map that you'll get for your retirement here's the number to call five to zero three nine nine\nSix three for one again there is no obligation and they're going to look at the big picture like we've been saying they'll talk to you about your needs your retirement your desires your dreams\nAnd based on that conversation they're going to provide you with a meaningful asset position as a map and if you want greater level of certainty about your income and your financial well being than don't pass\nThis offer up have you've saved about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement that number to call is five to zero three nine nine six three for one you call right now during our show five twenty three Ninety nine sixty three

...\nAgain in January I Am on hold for Medicare seasoned\nBoss Sam okay because you're very busy so let me just guide you to their website for everything Rhett Evo dot com R. E. T. E. V. O. dot com\nToday we're talking about what if we live until we're one hundred okay we're talking about financial considerations for those people living to be one hundred carrying if you have clients who do crunched the numbers and it appears that they're going to come up short on assets to last them through a long retirement what would be their options\nWell I think it's kind of funny looming on because you just invite our listeners to call in if they've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement uh-huh and some people may be thinking what are you crazy you just told me I Need a million plus ... right so again I Want to go through we talked about what all of those assets may be\nSo if it looks like you're going to come up short or if you're worried about coming up short there are some obvious steps you can take one of them is to start saving more right now so if you're not in retirement yet\nStart saving more contribute as much as you can afford and as much as the law allows to your retirement plans whether it's a four O. one K. or an IRA\nOr a ... or whatever that vehicle may be that you have the ability to contribute to and also take advantage of any matching retirement plan contributions or stock purchase programs from an employer folks that's free money take the free money right\nWhite and if you're over fifty also try to take advantage of these catch up provisions that the government has provided for us with your retirement accounts and the federal government allows people who are\nOver age fifty to make a larger tax deferred retirement plan contributions to kind of make up a little bit of that ground than maybe you didn't do when you were younger\nNow eventually once retirement hits I've learned from you that it becomes a matter of converting assets and didn't come right\nIt does and you need to do this at a rate that really provide you with enough income to cover your expenses an fund the lifestyle you want to live but you have to be careful that that we really doesn't deplete your asset based so much that you run out of money prematurely you need to take stock of your retirement income sources establish how\nMuch money you'll have coming in from where\nWhen and second in command so that may be things like Social Security your retirement account maybe it pension\nYour investments needy income from a job we have lots of retirees who go on to reinvent themselves them retirement and go work in their passion versus they're kind of day to day drudgery they felt like they may have been doing maybe you've got rental properties maybe you have a new at ease\nYou want to figure out the rate at which you can sustainably\nSpend down your assets so that they last as long as you can eat\nAt the end of the day everybody needs a retirement income strategy a written planned right\nYou'd do it really is important and not only do you need a written plan done so that you have an idea of what's happening\nToday based on things but it needs to be revisited in the future because no matter how long you expect to live you need some type of blueprint for how you're going to spend on those assets\nGive you a game plan for having that monthly income that you need every month and given some of these complexities developing a retirement income strategy\nIsn't necessarily a do it yourself undertaking so even if you're pretty savvy about investing and finances developing an overall strategy really understanding where that red lines falls and your retirement plan where you actually going to run out of money\nThis is one of those things you may be better off developing in conjunction with a financial professional somebody who can be your ...\nGoing to run out of money this is one of those things you may be better off developing in conjunction with a financial professional somebody who can be your coach through that process\nSo whether retirement is already upon you know whether it's just close at hand maybe even a distant reality my contemporaries are certainly starting to look at retirement now that the goal for everybody really is the same you want to keep as much money as you can in your own pocket so you have choices in control\nOf not only your financial present but also your future folks this does not happen by accident which you really need is a well thought out strategy for your retirement and the best thing you can do is develop it with the help of somebody who understands the big picture and all the moving pieces\nSo today we're offering you a chance to give them a call ... retirement

be just for you and Karen tell us when they call this number what will the experience when they go in and visit with you\nWhen you come in and visit in that first appointment I think the first thing to really set folks minds at ease is to know that nobody's going to sell you anything you are not expected to buy something new ... which is going to be made to you\nThe first appointment and our firm is really an opportunity for us to get to know due to get to know what your goals are in retirement to understand\nMore about your specific financial picture\nAnd to make sure that you are able to pull that altogether even your own mind sometimes people can ended up first appointment where they thought they were wasn't quite where they are when they start digging through their documents and looking at him so that first appointment is a chance for us to just kind of be backed\nMinors and figure out where you are and then at the end of that appointment if you decide yeah I'm exactly where I Want to be thank you so much for your time I'm happy to shake your hand in part ways we're always here as a resource but at the end of that appointment if you\nThink that where you are today may not really be in line with your goals or do you think you just really want to get\nA second opinion a real detailed analysis that's what our second appointment has about\nThat second appointment we take

see a complete snapshot of where you are in your retirement picture today\nCompared to your goals and objectives and do those to match up and we really think that this analysis as a critical piece of moving forward in retirement\nSome strategies to help ensure that your money can\nLast as long as you do the analysis is completely customized it's based on your own unique circumstances not cookie cutter and there's no obligation so if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement here's number to call you can call right now during our show five to zero three nine nine six three four one\nK. your own personalized map you're meaningful asset positioning about your retirement that never again five twenty\nThree Ninety nine sixty three forty one I Want to remind you it never hurts to get a second opinion either right let's say you have a retirement plan but you maybe want to get a second opinion a second set of eyes to look at it if you don't have a plan now is the perfect time to get started five twenty three nine nine six three\nFor one again you're listening to retirement evolved with Kevin damn shit I'm ... and Karen is here to help you to\nCoach you maybe you have questions about Medicare because enrollment is now maybe you have questions just about retirement and general things we're talking about today are you going to have enough money to last\nYou too and through your entire retirement let me give you their website it's red Evo dot com R. E. T. E. V. O. dot com also you can go to Brett evil map\nDot com that's another place you can log on and learn more about them and play around with some various tools with your retirement again read Evo dot com or read evil map dot com\nKaren what am I don't have a pension but I have an IRA or I have a four one K. what could I Do to stretch the assets and those accounts so that they will be capable of lasting until I'm a hundred years old or more\nWell the way and I appreciate you giving that red ... map dot com website because those tools on there are fantastic and a great place for you to start doing some research on your own\nMap dot com website because those tools on there are fantastic and a great place for you to start doing some research on your own and I think it's really important because when we look at the four one K. the onus is really on the employee knocked the employee earth to fund that\nPlant so it's the individual not the employer who has\nTo figure out how they're going to stretch their assets so they're not exhausted prematurely that's because funds from a four O. one K.\nOr another type of qualified account are often required to come out each year beginning at the individuals they adjust Seventy and a half\nThis is what we call required minimum distributions or are in these for short and this time of year of course we're talking a lot to her clients who they've got to be taking there are indeed so if they hit Seventy and a half this year they're coming back into our office we're making sure those are good and structured for them\nSo in most cases at least currently these types of plants don't have features that allow the account holders to convert their assets directly into an income stream\nIn my experience I'd say maybe ten or twenty percent of the defined contribution plans like a four one K. offered that option to a new a tie it into an income stream the numbers increasing that that's kind of where we are today you know it really is important though to build an income stream for yourself\nGiving yourself a form of that longevity insurance we kind of talked about at the beginning of the show but deciding whether you're a good candidate for an annuity and if so what kind that's a discussion you should absolutely have with someone who understands how long have you with these work someone who is independent have\nAccess to lots and lots of options in the annuity world really someone who lives in breezes stuff every day and has a really deep understanding of it because\nThe products themselves are not always as trans parent and it's clear as we'd like them to be so if you've got questions about your retirement strategy if you're not really clear wet that income stream is going to look like maybe you've got a snappy little report in your hand that says hey here's how much I have\nBut you don't really know how that's going to play out over the course of your retirement then\nOf course you probably want to get a second opinion and we welcome you to come on into the office down with myself or John Moscow and member of our team and take a look at where you stand today and see maybe how you can maximize those assets to become that quality income stream that you need during your retirement\nAnd the first step is getting a customize map a meaningful asset positioning to get a detailed analysis showing your entire income picture\nAnd then covering areas where there may be opportunity for your assets to generate income during retirement we're talking about uh customize assessed that it's going to help uncover areas where there's opportunity to help grow your retirement nest egg so it does provide enough income for as long as you needed to\nWe're all living longer these days and that's what we're talking about today longevity if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement here's the number to call\nFive to zero three nine nine six three for one you can

retirement plan you want a second set of eyes than give us a call if you don't have a plan they can help you get started five to zero three nine nine six three for one\nTo get your money to last until

Karen\n... retirement evolution where they know that you've worked so hard investing and planning for this exciting time in your life\nRetirement it's either approaching or maybe you're already living that dream carrot advisors women and families she's the director of resolutions wealth solutions for women as she is certified in Social Security so she can guide you through the Web of benefits\nShe can show you the optimum time to claim and she's also Medicare specialist it's some room at time right now\nShe can help you with all of those things so care let's get back to what we're talking about we're talking about the steps that people need to take right now to increase the chances that there needs to last to age one hundred and beyond and\nYou're not giving us any help tips or anything like that but we're just talking about the fact that people could run out of money and we know that's the number one fear Karen of huge piece of their retirement income puzzle is Social Security and since we're focused on making our income last over the course of retirement what suggestions do you have\nFor claiming benefits for Social Security we've got to be\nSure that you're managing your Social Security retirement benefits wisely people approaching retirement age certainly should carefully consider when to start taking those payments and while you can opt to start payments as early as sixty two\nIf you don't need that income at sixty two it is usually in your best interests to delay those payments at least until full retirement age somewhere between sixty six and six to seven depending on when you were born that's when you become entitled to the fall or the\nOn reduced Social Security benefits so in some cases the right way to max my Social Security benefits to delay payments until sometime\nAfter what the government even considers full retirement age such as waiting all the way up to age Seventy when you do that when you wait for full retirement age to age Seventy this can be a real value in earning those delayed retirement credits because\nThey increase the monthly benefit that you get when you start taking your pain and that increased becomes permanent\nSo delaying make a big big difference for people and according to a recent analysis that we saw putting off taking benefits from age sixty to just to the full retirement age of age sixty six will generate about thirty three percent\nOff taking benefits from age sixty to just to the full retirement age of age sixty six will generate about thirty three percent more in monthly income while\nWaiting from sixty to the age Seventy ends up yielding a Seventy six percent\nJump in income so for example a person who would get a thousand\nDollar a month benefit\nAt age sixty two would end up if they waited 'til full retirement age that income would be Thirteen thirty three a month\nBut if they wait 'til age Seventy that income become Seventeen sixty a month so I said it before I'll say it again seek professional

a careful thought process that involved many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that's due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again\nNow you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows\nBut the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result so what do we think the right thing to do is was definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market\nSo our retirement planning process at Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street we've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place they keep our money growing\nThere are much safer alternatives out there and even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could be\nAn IRA or rock ... roll over IRA and inherited IRA or a four\nO. one K. or even just regular saving money\nAnd in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nWhy take the risk on a deep pass to score another touchdown when you've already got such a big lead\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial and the state protection services we feel that what we do is so important we help our clients right here in southern Arizona take some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio\nWe do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customize plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall

don't put your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market\nThere's so many risks from all sorts of different avenues especially right now there are so many economic wrists out there and talk of a slowdown we're seeing action on tariffs and trade wars and rising interest rates\nEven major investment from some of them are telling their clients to get out of the market and that we are quote in the last hurrah of the market I don't care what you think about what's going on in the White House or how the media is portraying everything when it comes down to it\nThe economy and Wall Street are going to do what it does on its own\nEconomies are cyclical it's always been that way and it always will and the fact is right now we're seeing signs that were near or already at the top\nAlan Greenspan put it best when during the dot com bubble of the nineties he said he saw quote irrational exuberance\nNow maybe it hasn't reached that far maybe it has you'll be the judge\nSo even if you have a Wall Street portfolio now but you feel like you're safe with your bond funds\nDon't fall into the false sense of security that you think you might have innate bond fund now I spent ten years as a Wall Street advisor and many advisors they don't talk about this but a bond fund or bond mutual fund or ATF\nThey all have the potential to lose principle value you may think that they are safe because they send a bond but unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street\nAnd it trades and it moves it has a price and it's highly sensitive to interest rates so if rates are on the rise\nThose bond fund values will go down and depending on how fast rates move your principal value in that bond fund could decrease substantially faster than your funding yield in the last Twenty years or so we've been in a downward trending interest rate environment\nTo where they almost went to zero in two thousand nine\nNow rates are on the rise and we have yet to ever experience in the history of Wall Street what kind of an effect long term rising rate have on bond funds so what do you do\nHere at Mayfield financial and the state protection services for over twenty five years right

worry free financial solutions I'm Nathan Federico a safe money retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives\nIs the wealth building an earnings space this is a time when we are working trying to save\nIt's a time when we contribute to things like for one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet\nAnd should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building too well spending the second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRA\nWell spending the second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets\nInto income\nAnd in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you're a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan and it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement especially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives\nThis is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case in IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they had the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees\nThis is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nOne that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial an estate protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plans do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four O. one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive all with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no conditions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get more information on how a safe money plan could help protect your hard earned money and your four one K. and your savings and your IRAs all you need to do

talk about today what we talked about the last couple of weeks folks this is not a popular message this is not one where people say hey kids let's gather around a mark in the smart money moves show is on\nA and he's got to talk about where the the cataclysmic the financial sue nominee that's common boy this is going to be great for us to hear\nThat that typically doesn't happen but if you can walk

and say let the show being different let it be in its own environment versus all the other financial talk shows that are on the radio\nAnd that's not the pat ourselves on the back but it is to say this\nWe want to tell you what's going on to get you to pick up the phone and call us and have you come in and that's where we put the plan together that's where we address what we call the five boroughs of life so it's not a popular message and we're going to talk more about it here and just a little bit but\nYes you you if you're a avid listen to mark what about the salute them I didn't forget that so here we go to America [noise] and um\nYou if you're a avid listener mark what about the salute to I didn't forget that so here we go to America [noise] Adam\n... way back we talked about first responders and I kinda wanted to throw that out again today because of an incident that happened recently with a a dear friend of ours his wife got in a very serious car accident and he was relating this story that ah the people that showed up\nThe police the ambulance\nAnd then the the the surgeon at the hospital all these people it was like a symphony of making sure that this gal was going to be okay and so at listening to his story it made me realize that you know at the end of the day when things happen\nWe want those first responders to be at the top of the game right for us and we want them to have had a good night's sleep we want the surgeon to not be drinking caffeinated coffee we want them to I'm kidding but we want them to be at\nOut of the annuities out of the life insurance and you're right the markets backup yet have you hurt your annuities or have you hurt your life insurance now and we explain all that to you\n... come to a greater understanding and appreciation just adds to the leverage that these vehicles can provide so that's something that you really I encourage you to consider it to me it's all about positioning\nAnd part of this means that you have to have the guts the\nThe the the inter intestinal fortitude to go look I Want to address this now is it a popular topic you'd probably at this point of view I gather the kids around the room you're telling and go play go outside more what Mark's talking about is not for your ears it's PG Thirteen it's like oh my goodness the stuff he is saying is going to happen looked\nA Math Doesn't lie it just doesn't and so this movie if you'd like to see the trailer the two and a half minute trailer to the power of zero\nYou can email me I had a gentleman I emailed it to me [laughter] he emails evacuee goes this is scary stuff you know it's almost so scary people dismiss it they got there's absolutely no way this was going to happen so here's the question what if I'm wrong\nWhat is this stuff never happens have we heard you by how we position how we re deploy how we put you in in areas where we are protecting\nWhat you have a mass what you have created what you have grown the answer is no we aren't you know let's say I'm right you will come out on top you will have done the very\nBest the most prudent thing you can do at this juncture by positioning yourself for what I Believe\nIs inevitable this is not politically expedient aren't you just tired I Know I Am and I noticed Asian plays the ads and all I'm just tired I'm sick and tired I'll use I'm sick and tired frustrated over all the political ads that are running in the name calling and listen to that and to that and this and\nYou know what it's just I'm I'm done with it I mean can we taught those people all of them my opinion they don't really care and this is my opinion mark any can write me hate me hate mail whatever they're in this for them they're in this\nFor them it's not politically expedient for them to say you know what we have to raise taxes you have to cut benefits we have to switch the full retirement age for Social Security nobody wants to say that because then they're not going to get reelected but\nWhat I'm saying to you right now is so important that if you don't have\nThis you're not going to be positioned to take advantage of when the bad news comes\nSo here's a couple of questions I Want to ask you and oh by the way that two and a half minute trailer just email me mark at more F. S.\nDot com market more F. S. dot com emailed me I'll send you the trailer no hooks no catches no obligations just something you need to know in fact at the office we are we we we kind of kid ourselves back and forth we say you know what\nNot only do most people not believe this message\nMost financial advisors don't believe this message they are not talking to their people about what's\nComing because at the end of the day they're trying to sell you something they're trying to get you one more percentage rate of return\nAbout what's coming because at the end of the day they're trying to sell you something they're trying to get you one more percentage rate of return than the guy down the street or your funds are currently\nThis message if heated\nYou will look like a superstar within your family within your neighborhood\nWithin your world there'll be looking at you going well how did you how do you know this was coming well you know I listen to the smart money moves on Saturday and he's talking about this I went and saw the movie the power is zero I saw the trailer I've read the book I I I'm now more students now more aware of what's going on in our world and why\nPolicy kitchens are not talking about this\nThe presses are rolling the printing presses are printing money at an astronomical rate and as a result we are putting our kids our grandkids in harm's way\nWhat's the message the message is and then we'll talk about these questions here what's this mark what's the strategy here's a strategy your weight and you got your pen pencil and ... taxes are on sale\nToday pay the tax get it over with just be done with it\nPut your money in a in an environment where it all grows zero tax will mark what if the government changed the laws you know there's always that opportunity yet you're right but historically what has happened is if you're in certain vehicles where its tax exempt when you go to pull it out they grandfather\nThose policies those plans that are already in place so don't let that concern you what should concern you is what this trailer is two and a half minute trailer is saying to you\nSo don't do what the politicians are doing which is sticking their heads in the sand and hoping that it blows by them at least so that they can get reelected what you should be doing is saying what do I need to do today to protect my kids and my grandkids and my family what am I doing today to protect them\nThat's what the message is pay the taxes they get it over with taxes are on sale is that debatable will I get and get all these calls with Martin would any taxes are on sale look at look how much I'm paying my taxes yeah I get that\nBut if worse if we're spending a trillion dollars more than we're taking in every year and what what hasn't helped is the fact that tax rates were cut think about that I\nMean I Love Trump either what he's doing attach races were cut tax rates were cut in spending has been increased then it's a it's a double whammy right\nBut it's not too late for you give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four you want to see the trailer to the movie happy to send that to you you'd like\nThe uh the pack at the

because it is a game don't want to do that won't\nGo there won't do that so give us a call two nine six\nFour four six four to nine six four four six four I have to mention this thing as well and I think it's important and it it dovetails very much so into what we're talking about when it comes to long term care and I I'm hoping my prayer my uh\nMy hope is that we can get Mr Harley Gordon to come to town he's a uh you'd probably one of the foremost\nA elder care attorneys and the country and he's written a book and so I said a little bit ago before the break we're going to talk about his book it's called the convert station called the conversation and this is what are\nYou know ... this conversation people don't want to have this how how apropos\nTo Harley's book\nAnd the subtitle is helping someone you love plan for an extended care event\nLook it's easy for me and I'm I'm not going to do this but it would be easy for me to take out all the statistics that are out there about how many people are going to need long term care how many people every sixty four seconds are diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia\nYou know what that does not connect with people we think as agents that it does it it will put people in a position of they start to worry they get anxious that this anxiety they've created say wow I Need to pick up the phone and call those guys one person every sixty eight seconds is being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia wanted that to me\nWell folks that doesn't encourage people to do the planning it just scares them into maybe not doing anything\nSo Harley's book really brings front and center the idea that it's not about now I'm Talking to the guy here when they get this it's us guys we have a hard time with a guy\nGuys men gentleman it's not about the risk of you ending up in a facility or having to have care that's not what's at stake here that's not the issue that's not what you're jeopardizing what you are jeopardizing and this is the real message\nIs the consequence of you not having a plan the consequences of what's going to happen to you I'm Sorry to your family\nYour kids your grandkids your spouse should something happen to you this is Carol is\nIn fact if you don't have a plan it is likely that will it will tear your family apart\nIt will tear your family apart\nNot having a plan and not properly funding it can disrupt all efforts to secure a sense of financial viability as you and your family move into the future that's what not having a plan will do\nYou know what we have a deep as a gay guys again women you can don't have listeners but us guys we by nature heavy deep seated aversion to thinking about anything truly awful occurring do you like nobody nobody gets up in the day hey what if\nBy nature heavy deep seated aversion to thinking about anything truly awful occurring do you like nobody nobody gets up in the day hey what if I get in a car accident today what if I have a stroke whatever ... nobody likes to think about that stuff\nNor do they like to think what if I have a need for care what if I'm going to have to have somebody paid me feed me clothe me take me to doctors appointments\nAnd so as a result because nobody thinks about the subject is dismissed and that's what Harley Gordon's contention is that being more the case certainly when you're talking about hey you need to own a long term care insurance policy\nSo what Harley's hope when he put together this book was to change your mind by altering how the subject is talked about\nWhat I Hope to do what my goal is when I have this conversation you had the conversation and nobody wants to have is to say this\nIs that when I'm done I Want you and your mind as say mark Jeff really the conversation the consequences are too severe\nThat I Need to take action I Need to do something because I don't want to put I don't want to have my kids my grandkids my spouse left to deal with this\nSee one way or the other you're going to be kept safe if you have an incident you have an extended care event they are going to find a way to take care of you we know that we're here in America right somebody will rise up something will happen whether you have money you don't have you will be taken care of\nThat's not the problem the problem is what is going to happen\nTo your family it's about your commitment to protect your family regardless of what happens to you the book talks about as he says you're the serious and often irreversible consequences providing care\nCan have on those you invited into your life I think about that\nThe consequences to those you love you said yes to the altar\nYou now have embraced over the years you saw them through elementary school and middle school and high school and college and now they have careers and now are they going to have to put their life on hold\nSee we have that conversation that's a conversation a lot of people don't want to have it hits you square between the eyes of like oh my goodness Well Mark I don't think that's ever going to happen well okay let's have a plan\nJust in case it does happen look you're going to be fine but it's the consequences to those you love and you care about those are going to be the ones that you might be doing irreversible damage to should you not have a plan in place\nThat is what Harley's book is about\nA I Believe it's in reprint right now they're they're printing more and so we're hoping to get some of those as well that may be a give away you you want to call you say mark a when you get a copy of the conversation yes what do I have to deal you have to come in you have to have the conversation with us and then we'll give you the conversation\nBut look if you don't want to have your family put their lives on hold to take care of you then you need to have a plan in place that's our our encouragement to you have a plan in place\nBecause this is what Harley says and I'll conclude with this he says what most people don't understand is that extended care is not a series of risks that what happened to them but rather a set of serious if not irreversible consequences\nThat happened to them\nBut rather a set of serious if not irreversible consequences that would happen to those that\nYou love this is risk versus consequences\nThat's really at the end of the day what this is about so give us a call two nine six\nFour four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five two three five nine for six five will you have this conversation with us at more financial we hope that you will\nA couple of months ago I talked about the perfect financial plan\nThe perfect financial plant is that possible we believe it it is in fact society dictates to us that whatever it is that you as an industry put together it needs to be simple it needs to be efficient\nAnd so we're happy to let you know that we have figured that out\nThis does not need to be complicated in fact many people will come into the office wanting it to be complicated say whoa nearly let's pull back a little bit with this does not have to be complicated it can be simple but simple doesn't mean it's not going to be a fish", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "27"}
