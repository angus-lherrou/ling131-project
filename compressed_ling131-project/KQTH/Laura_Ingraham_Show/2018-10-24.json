I don't think I've got like a day and like three or four years about just thinking about it and how great it would be but so what's the dream car\nIt's a a BMW and three forty six one so\nOkay and how you're going to maintain that puppy because your maintenance on that's pretty serious\nYeah a K continuing to work you know what I hear from other owners is that costs about on average Fifteen hundred to two thousand a year to just keep it in good shape and maintain it\nAnd you know I'm an armed thankful that my job right now\nI'm can pay me enough to to you know continue to fund mhm Mm\n[noise] um well you pick out a very cool car no question about on way career for sixteen years old no question so happy unless automobile really is a it typically is going to be a car though by someone who is has a um a really really good income and the Fifteen hundred dollars\nTo keep it running every year is a minor part of their world instead of like a hundred percent of your income you know it's a Fifteen hundred ... is a big part of your world a year it's not a hundred percent of your income but I mean it's a big part of your world is sixteen years old and a you know I'm more concerned about that owned going maintenance cost of this thing that I Am the actual purchased\nUm well I I I did the math and I make about [noise] uh you know Eighteen thousand a year and now that really doesn't change it do other than the uh\nYour mid term election yesterday should they should have one phone line to see a juice on\n\n\nActually is in Los Angeles I actually welcome to the ... [noise] Fridays thanks for taking my call sure what's up in your work\nHow um my husband and I don't agree he recently came back from a deployment and said he wants a divorced in a bankruptcy [noise] so um\nWe are fifty thousand dollars on a diet and last year remain thirty five of them are dead breaks down to twenty five and car penance tantamount and Fifteen and credit card ... I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] so uh what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back a family\nSo you're separated [laughter] okay and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay [noise] and um do you have children now so\nI'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce was going ahead or not\nIt will be okay right well\nWhether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do when you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed except the sheets on some of the papers or she got to file too but um and we had to follow on all the different corporations mellow season that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago [noise]\nUm so uh in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan out\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan in mind okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your student loan either way whose name of the credit cards in Baltimore\nEvenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them got more heat to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name is the car in\nBaltimore who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on them and he has run and I gather\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nAre Fifteen and Dan ... OK\nOkay the rule on a an\nHas um\n... that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt the ball it's not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt\nOkay you're following me but the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt and that in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nFifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea [noise] I'd say about ten okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that and then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is\nThat if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\n[laughter] or if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car that he's driving is it worth at least once rode on it\nAnd say about that okay\nSo you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay Sam so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\n'em I made a veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working full time\nAre you a D. V. M\nNo oh no no and the ... [laughter]\nOkay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or are you going to ask him where else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it\nYeah okay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be what does he make\nIf he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be what does he make\n[noise] ah last year he made about a twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nIs still in his share in the military [laughter]\nYeah you'll have no security clearance you understand that he understands what I'm sure you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo I mean his chances are moving up in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or mine corruption but he didn't make any money should man and he just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind and I was like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] Mm oh I'm so sorry thank\nYou know he's just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is a\nChronic haven't yeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to sell your ... to ... I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loans for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you [laughter] so I'm Sorry your face and all this what a mouse listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay\nThank you thank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGood Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nHad a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guys Vander and uh [noise]\nYou know they had and I'm kinda borderline whether or not to get a term life insurance [laughter] I've got a wife to kids at home and I'm the premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise] if I Do get approved so I guess my question is two parts in do I still go for it even if it's\nYou know three four hundred dollar a month premium um three or four hundred a month for how much coverage\nFor a ten times my my pay a million\nDollars for a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nUh basically ... to\n... you know how to get you okay are you are you overweight\nYeah okay that'll give me too [laughter] yeah okay\nYeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the way down which also by the way up should I be Dr already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm working on a good good for you so hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and like a smaller policy until we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\nHere and um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so [laughter] you already knew these things right right um yeah\nUh but but I I mean what if you took half\nAnd at least you know she's are or how much you own your home of two eighty [laughter] what does she does she work outside the home now she wants\nAnd at least you know she's are or how much you own your home [noise] uh two eighty [laughter] what does she does she work outside the home she works she works at home\nNow so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and put a couple of hundred in her pocket if something happened to you that's better than a half million it's not the proper\n[noise]\n\nThey're struggling with money relationships career you name it you're stuck\nI mean I and and I've talked to him and people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing is to possible approaches\nOh a main money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\n... mom we were so scared mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and put man I feel so much better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say now you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you ... what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nWill you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control and they got it or that Debbie Downer right or party thing right the martyr thing now and people do that all the time and as soon as I Do that that's your opening jump in and go\nI think you can I really am because I felt the same way I didn't think I could do it but I think you really can I think you can have\nIt when it ... and they do at the you\nKnow no no no you're you're already you already jumped to the front lawn you got slammed down his you start saying that and that conversation is she gonna shut you down you know they are all you got to do just talk about what if you did for you are not for her just get\nAbout enabling like with your alcoholics and obviously you wouldn't go out and drink and John Barr knowing what I Would I\nGive you money to drink\nRights and my parents they're basically eating out to death by ... times a day\nFor all does and and my dad got ... tired and they only have one income that are living on to it and kind of you know\nAnd and so when we met that they don't live in our in our state and the legal visit them and my dad he wants to take us out here that fancy dinner just show that he loved that and we live here so much but I just want to scream absolutely not saying that our kids and that I don't want to drain our relationship\nWell it just said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go bad you only take us out to eat your two broke that stupid\nIf you know I ... well that's what you're thinking and I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that kind of stuff so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you back to you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors but you're just back and talk about\nUsed to feel the way and you turn it loose you used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not in you know of course that only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and you know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went broke we killed each other I Know how it feels to fight\nThe way and you know tell the truth and you know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went ... we've got killed each other I Know have bills to fight\nAbout money and um we'll fight about money anymore and have it in years\nUh and so how do you how do you fix that what do you do and you're just share your story talk about your story and they will start chasing you eventually to get that and go if if they ever reach out and say well we should look into that hey I can show you how you want me to tell you what we're doing\nBut don't ever returning go deep one step deeper and go because you're stupid\nBecause you're doing this wrong you go out to eat all the time he got stopped that don't turn into the instructor\nBecause the instructor or you're you're not in a position to be the instructor all you can do is lead them if you want to go to Patrick ... my my pay for it 'cause it changed my life not because you're so stupid you need it\nYou see the difference and you just keep directing it back through you through your story that your only shot and just talk about what it's done for you not what it'll do for them and then pay for it pay for it for them to go through and I'm\nJust like mom someday when you're rich you can pay for the rest of the kids to go through or something if you want but right now under this is my guest just because of what it's done for me and you know it might not work for you but it's worked for me you know and just kind of keep playing it off and making them chase it a little bits of begging them to be smart\n[noise] hope that helps you [noise] open phones a AAA eight to five

covered learn how it works\nBecause it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim show it's worked for forty years you know I mean or whatever number of years but decades rise so uncomfortable with its credibility in that regard\nSo it's worked for forty years you know I mean or whatever number of years but decades right so uncomfortable with its credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in at\nNumber three and the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian\nHealth care ministries and so a ... and the ... that their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so they're hardcore in that regard um and so you need to you know be aware that that's there and that's a limiting factor as well and they ... you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process you're Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's what it's for and how it's laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that way and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question we were to go through that doing in baby steps to and all that kind of up one of the things that my wife with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking to the as the long term track record and and we're okay we're all the requirements we're yeah we're we're evangelical Christians and all that kind of stuff and we're and we're normally pretty healthy and it seems like a good fit\nFor our family but like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like when I say for Fifteen hundred bucks and stuff so if you're a baby sat here would you recommend it when they go that route to set aside that they had a dollar to insulate you against our\nAre now you've got an already gotten you've already got a thousand and baby sit around and so you're close enough\nOf that and if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget slow or you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby steps who covers some bills if you had an event right right right and it's just like carrying largest adoptable as you said in a nature or something I'm but I'm going to take that\nPart of the risk gone for sure and I'm so forth but but yeah Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call April's weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are you\nHave to say Hi Dave thanks for

All right\nAnd you know our debt other than the market is about a thousand dollars\nMhm mhm um but ... Hank trash K.
