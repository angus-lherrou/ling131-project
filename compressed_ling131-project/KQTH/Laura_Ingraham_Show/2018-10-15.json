or with a you know nothing more than an accusation no cooperation no backup everything that she pointed to does not back up her story the news media is fine with that because\nThey're not fact based people their political operatives I they don't look at the facts\nAnd the same is true with a with Russia and in fact there is a great story today Chuck Ross reporting FBI has evidence that quote directly refuse and quote premise of Trump Russia probe G O P congressmen says this is the Daily Caller\nRepublican lawmakers have hinted for months that the FBI failed to provide federal judges are on the surveillance court with information that under the government's ... premise for opening the Trump Russia probe and two thousand sixteen\nTexas representative John Ratcliffe provided Sunday that's yesterday the clearest\nPicture to date of what the FBI allegedly withheld from the surveillance court Ratcliffe suggested that the FBI failed to include evidence regarding former Trump

receiving information from the Australian government about a\n... a conversation that Papadopoulos had on may twenty two thousand sixteen with Alexander down her the top Australian diplomat in the u._k.\nNow down or claimed that Papadopoulos told him the Russians had derogatory information on Hillary Diane rod ham Clinton\nBut Radcliffe top member of the house Judiciary Committee suggested Sunday the FBI and Justice Department had information that contradicts its own intelligence on Papadopoulos\nThe congressman said hypothetically if the department of justice and the FBI have another piece of evidence that directly refused that that directly contrasts\nHypothetically if the department of justice and the FBI have another piece of evidence that directly refused that that directly contradicts that what you would expect is for the department of justice to present both sides of the coin to the foreign intelligence surveillance court\nTo evaluate the weight and sufficiency of that evidence Ratcliffe set\nAnd said what happened here was department of justice and FBI officials in the Obama administration in October of two thousand sixteen only presented the court the evidence that made the government's case to get a warrant to spy on Trump's campaign associates\nSo once again excluding evidence corrupt play excluding evidence\nWhich is what they do because they were stacking the case they were they were a loading it they were corrupt thing they corrupted the investigation that's what they did\nLeslie stall asked about the phoney baloney Russian dressing you know that no a reporter has broken a story on the Russia investigation that doesn't echo the Obama administration's efforts I haven't seen I think maybe Catherine heritage otherwise I haven't seen a single report\nThat's not true John Solomon John Solomon has reported um and uh his compatriots as well Leslie saw President Trump on Russia\nHillbillies that the Russians interfered in the two thousand sixteen campaign at election I ain't they metal but I think China metal two phone lines and then you wonder why ... why don't you tell me ... metal on metal also and I think frankly China\nAre probably going to be diverting the whole\nRussia than dealing headline saying Russia but I'm also saying China\nYeah I I don't know they can't wrap their brains around this they they just need to stick with the China with the Russian narrative I mean you say look you know ISIS metals by the way ISIS says put out a contract on\nA President Trump as well a new ISIS plot has been uncovered to assassinate President Trump\nSo another example of the Democrats and ISIS being on the same page\nAs happens so often why do you say China she's outrage well because China also meddled in our election and for some reason you guys can't wrap your little tiny squarely brains\nAround the fact that the Russians aren't the only ones that messed with people all the comedies do all the left these do it's what the left these do hear 'em and here's President Trump throwing in her face a bit on the Russia thing\nPeriod I think that cold Russia to help me with an election give me a break [noise] they wouldn't be able to help me at all for\nRussia so ridiculous you know they're the media they're all running a the audio today of President Trump saying hey if you've got to Hillary's emails you'll be rewarded for them I'm ... now he's attacked for their child this is just wonderful this is great listen to this this clip\nAh Lesley still but you separate children at the border\nFrom their parents like Obama did the same thing with the laws on the books the Democrats just don't want to enforce laws that the Democrats so uninformed they don't care what the laws\nThey don't care whether it's the law that that you should enforce or whether there's not a law and they and forests something that's not a law anyway but this is a great and uh and she Leslie stall reveals the big reveal is at the end\nThat it's just it's almost I laughed out loud last night\nWhat about the force separation of children from ... migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books but he didn't important [laughter]\nI Love that it was on the books\nObama had the same time it was on the books but he didn't and for that [laughter]\nI Love that it was on the books but he didn't for so so he's the hero of the story because he doesn't enforce our laws\nAnd first of all that's a lie he ah he did it for so and then they stopped enforcing now do you separate may
