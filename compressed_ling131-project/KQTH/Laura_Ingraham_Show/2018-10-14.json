C. registered investment advisor insurance and annuity products are sold several a through premier retirement planning and wealth management\n[noise] here's one thing to retire and it's another to stay retired it's your money with Jeff voting and Linda ... from from your retirement planning and wealth management\nYou've heard the saying the rich get richer but have you ever wondered exactly how do they do that and how you might be able to do that to how do they get away with paying fewer taxes and everyone else\nHow do they seem to effortlessly keep making money and having a grow and grow and you do that too well that's the subject of our show today Welcome to it's your money I'm Jeff Logan president a premier retirement planning of wealth management and today we're going to pull back the curtain on the lessons of how the rich get richer and how you can to\nMy oldest is with me Linda ... good morning and get annoying unhappy weekend man it's always a happy weekend so we have a good weeks to though what's you know every day as a happy day when ... when people retire and stay retired yeah I think\nI Love my job so you know a lot of people think millionaires get the you know it's kind of funny we talk about millionaires back when I was a kid a millionaire with some is so rich\nNow and I think I always find him in him it's kind of like that's kind of a number a lotta people shoot for for just kind of a basic retirement nevertheless there's a lot of people that\nDon't get to that million and winter oh my gosh how am I going to make at home I going to keep that income coming in my retirement so that uh I don't run out of money\nAnd um you know how to these people get million or millions of dollars in there for one case of their retirement plans or how did they say how did their how does their money keep working for them and they don't seem to be as worried as I Am maybe as my retirement that's how some people you know um sometimes thanks\nSo but just because you don't have a million dollars doesn't mean you can't live your ideal retirement\nNo it certainly doesn't next we're going to talk a lot of that has to do with just\nCreating habits and doing the things that those people that\nUm [noise] have a little bit more money have a little bit more practice at it and they and they have made some smart decisions along the way on one of the things that I always say is you know our our our job is to help people live their ideal retirement life and if you achieve that\nIt's because you've made some smart decisions along the way and and our job is advisors to help people make those smart decisions along the way and\nFor some people they kind of learn those smart decisions and they learn the smart money habits earlier in life than others unfortunately but it's never too late to start and so we're going to uncover the seven\nBiggest things that make a difference between what we see the successful people that come into our office and talk about planning by the way we have a lot of people that are you know would be considered the millionaires the multi millionaires rich people that come up that still want to tweak their plan and I think that's really leads into the number one answer is\nYou know you think the rich people they must be pretty smart they must be able to do it on their own but you know number one is they get advice\nThey value the advice of a professional\nThey do and you know most of them are professionals not most of them but many of them are professionals and have had careers where they are very specialized in their own area\nWell when I my very first career my primary career as that caller i._d. management consultant I was focused on understanding may um industry getting updated on that most current and managerial process for improvement I wasn't focused on finances I hired somebody to do that for me\nRight and and I think most people if you're if you've got a high paying job or you're really trying to save for retirement and be focused\nSo that you can make enough money to retire comfortably ... you're going to really have to be kind of a you know in a niche market be focused in a in an area where you're worth more and and typically those people\nThat have been able to save have had and have had good incomes are focused and we used to think of a doctor I mean there are great at medicine but\nYou know many of them have no clue about the financial aspects I mean I'm pretty good a finance I think I'm really good actually I mean if you don't mind me share my bias but I think you are [laughter] but you know I Lived I go to the doctor today because I have no idea what's wrong with my eyes so\nThat it was ... when you need\nExactly and you know money is no different there are um I wouldn't call them\nStrategies there are techniques there are products that worked different ways and you know knowledge is power and you can only get that knowledge by seeking it and sometimes just take it from a professional\nThat already has that power you know when you were the quality business you said before I mean you didn't just pick up all kinds of books and try to read and educate yourself because you had a job a fulltime job [laughter] you know um if you if you have a job and you're doing something else you can't be a master of all ... you can't be a Jack of all trades or you will be a manager of a non\n... and that's why we focus on comprehensive financial planning for those people that are getting ready to retire or are already retired and that's that's really the niche focus\nAnd that's the primary cracks that that they seek out professional advice but they have that plan that financial plan that retirement plan on and we've talked so many times about the importance of having that plan well\nIn you know it's it's it's no secret that the earlier you start with a plan the smarter decision that is so many people wait until the last minute and then decided to flat or they just think the plan is going to happen by itself because they accumulate\nA certain number of dollars out of hand and hand it it is but a lot of people say well I don't know I don't know who's managing my four oh one K. all I Know that I have to put in a regularly and somehow when I retire I'll have a magic number in there that will have to you know create some lifetime income from [noise] and [noise]\nI guess that's better than not at least they've saved at least they ... and that is a plan at least the plan is to save it accumulates but along the way there's a lot more things that will get into a throughout the show today that we'll talk about how how people that are wealthy and you don't have to not just the ... rich not just the super wealthy but just the the average\nThe day and the anxiety that's creating and then um because they haven't secured those sources of income and they're living that just in case lifestyle what if something happened we can't spend money we can't go on that trip because something might happen and then where would we be can you imagine\nThe sense of calmness security knowing that you will had those paychecks coming in to replace your implying that paycheck adult insurance\nYou know and I think the a very common way to do it as some people say well I'm just going to buy more dividends stocks because I can I can rely on the dividends or I'm going to buy more bonds\nAnd you know there there is a strategy is very simple and very basic strategy that I I think people will employ in that as\nWell as long as I have enough short term bonds to get me through a five year correction all be fine well in the meantime you're not making any money on those bonds you're spending all that principle down just waiting for your old assets in the stock market to get back to even\nAnd I say five years because that's how long the last two big corrections took the one in two thousand that ended in two thousand and two and the one in two thousand and eight that started running just before two thousand and eight ended in early two thousand and nine\nThose on the blue chip stocks crash fifty percent both times and both times it took five years for the market to get back to that even starting point and progress on so if you're spending down even if you're spending down\nBond or cash money that doesn't lose value you're not actually making money during that time you're actually spending down assets uh so that argument doesn't really hold water you need some actual income that you can use that generates in combat pay those bills every month so evidence stocks\nMay also go down by the way Yeah David in stocks may continue to pay that two or three percent dividend but if you need to use more than just that the evidence and\nAnd actually sell some stock because of a rainy day expanse were to actually uh liquidate some assets you're going to liquidate at a loss and so if that stocks may not be the answer bonds or may not be the answer if you're just spending them to live on while the market recovers\nUm we like Myers well we do like to learn but I was thinking you were going to jump ahead so I you know any of the queen sitting right next to me so I thought sure she was like we love annuities [noise] you know we don't level annuities we love the annuities that are fixed\nMeaning safe that create excellent income generally speaking they're going to be fixed indexed annuities that go up when the market goes up they don't go down when the market goes down and those companies are able to create a much better guaranteed lifetime income stream\nThat companies use variable products because they're not taking risk with your money if you're going to guarantee income don't you want a guaranteed product yes ah it's kinda like I Want to make\nSure that I I Can't ever run out of money\nAnd they guarantee never run out of money even if the account drops to zero and you mentioned alert this what lurks also the life insurance retirement plan also have um a very similar gift and that is guaranteed lifetime income not all life insurance policies run out when your cash value runs out\nThat's been taken care of with the evolution of new\nYou know new generation life and insurance products where these companies you know life insurance companies want to be competitive in stay in business to they want to create products better products and do better things that can help people in retirement because they do own a piece of that retirement market they also want to make sure that you don't run out of money and even life insurance\nWhich by the way we don't buy 'em for death insurance unless you need to replace income for a spouse or a survivor\nBut we do love to place them in a portfolio in order to generate income on a tax benefit basis lurks give you a tax free income tax free death benefits an extra long term care bumps should you get sick or and need that money before you die and it's all tax free if you set it up right\nAnd that um it's all about taxes and having a tax strategy moving forward\nIf you save thirty thousand dollars a year in taxes\nThat's thirty thousand dollars a year actually you can spend we just did a plant where they're going to save about thirty thousand dollars a year in tax it we just wanted at this last week\nAnd it's amazing that just using the current tax code taken advantage of lower taxes now you can shift money out of IRAs either do rock and versions are confirmed alerts to take advantage of true leverage and tax leverage on your money to create a lot of extra tax benefits um [noise]\nYou know one thing ... uh or about taxes when we come back I think we're a run out time segment but\nYou know one last thing um I Would say that it is a good thing to do as far as income is not a bad thing they have real estate investments that generate income\nUm a lot of our clients have some people have generated some rental income that really has come in handy to have that consistent and could not keep in mind nothing's guaranteed you never know if that runner's going to move out in the middle of night but um that's why we need diversified sources of income we've talked about several about talk about taxes when we\nCome back we're going to see if your plan is the first fight and you've got to retire you're ready to retire stay retired give us a call five too old to on seven eighty five sixty six that's for retirement readiness review to see if you are ready to retire and stay retired she will see one Seventy five six ...\n... the strategy he signed the ultra rich managed care [laughter]\n\nMm\nWhether you're already retired are planning to retire Jeff ... window whether you're familiar return of venting their wealth management will help you maximize your income minimize your taxes hair protect what you have more than a lifetime to achieve now back to his your money [noise]\nJak at that time again for your financial ... yes it is and this week we're talking about your retirement income planning checklist not that we haven't ever talked about income planning yet we talk\nAll the time in fact income in retirement is probably the most important topic at least it seems to be the most important topic to people that we meet with on a day in and day out basis so as an offer also for this tip just listening you can get if you want to give our officer call\nThe actual book it's a pretty thick or it's more than a brochure a booklet that is your retirement and complain checklist complementary of premier retirement planning a wealth management gives you ten\nItems that you need to consider as you consider your plant now first one is planned for a long life\nYou know it's it's amazing how much longer people are living it's amazing how often I find out people who come in and some of our clients are having their parents moved back in with them and there were a hundred or more or at least in the late nineties you know I read a statistic that\nIf you reach age sixty five up a couple of reaches a sixty five healthy there's a chance of forty percent chance that one of that couple is going to exceed eight Ninety so planning on a long life may be an important thing [noise] the other thing is because of that long life you might find out that you're paying a lot more health care expenses\nThan you thought and that is number two healthcare expensive not only will probably be a part of your life\nLonger but it will also consider the inflation and the fact that this ... I I Know it's just the fastest growing as far as inflation goes is the is the place in affects health care more than anything\nHow about housing plan or two that's number three you have a housing plan or are you going to downsize do you have a child with a big house it expects you to move into a mother in law quarter\nAssisted living should you be unable to get around or do things what if one of the spouse dies early what's the housing plan in that case so have a few contingencies for your housing plan what about long term care or assistance you know about half of the people\nUnfortunately don't just die in their sleep or die easy it's usually we get a little people we get a little bit to\nA disabled and we just can't do the things that we used to do so we need assisted living we may need to actually move into a home care facility for even for long term care that requires either a nice nest egg or some insurance consider the effects of what a long term care stay would do to you and your state\nHow about inflation is it here to stay well I think so you know the dollar keeps on having less and less buying power the older we get now keep in mind the older you get you may be doing less traveling maybe less fun stuff maybe buying cars less often and you may not find that you need a lot more income and your later years then the earlier years\nBut find out how your spending habits may change and consider inflation to be a part of that whether it's a\nYou're going to spend more than ... years and ... and then try to spend less than the later years remember that prices are going to be more in the later years so you're probably still need at least as much money as you do in the early years bottom line is inflation is here to stay you can't dismiss it\nHow 'bout regularly evaluate your goals casually we find people have changes in their life maybe they um [noise] just had a client coming yesterday that said they inherited their grandchild back into their house I'm the man who expected to retire next year is deciding he can't retire for at least another five years\nOr sometimes goals change and when those goals change it's good to have a review and make sure your financial advisor knows what those changes aren't can help you along the way\nWhat about Social Security benefits were our number seven now [noise]\nUm how do you maximize those uh what's the right decision if you make the wrong decision how much could cost you maybe tens of thousands of dollars so make sure you're\nAware of the options on Social Security how you take it when you take it make sure you utilizing every advantage for spousal ah resources spousal benefits I'm also for the widow benefit plan on one of you dying before the other we don't always die with our spouses so\nAh keep that in mind when you plan for maximizing Social Security also keep in mind the biggest expense most people have which many times they think is health care\nRule number one never lose money\nRule number two what's what's up when they attention to rule number one rule number one I think that's pretty good sage advice even though he's a multi billionaire and probably invest a little different than we do\nI Do know that we should take on every technique that Warren Buffett use it but he does give us some good advice don't lose money especially in retirement and I like\nThe quote by Lou Dobbs after the market crashed in two thousand he says you know you should never have money in the market you can't afford to lose ... ... ... you know it took a rude awakening of a big crash in two thousand which we've actually repeated them then they repeat again\nDon't have money in the market you can afford to lose rich people know that they want to if it's getting rich is one thing staying riches another right staying rich by protecting your principal and money that you may need\nIf you want to have some upside in some swing for the fence money and buy some apple or Amazon and those things you know they may be overvalued compared to conventional valuations but they're still going to be like that stuff that's fine just don't you just don't use your money you're going to need to live on next month clone ever know\nAnd that's her right now the market has been going crazy but we all know the she's going to drop the other she's going to drop sooner\nThan later and people can lose a large chunk of their retirements now's the time to take some of those chips off the table put him in to secure a vehicle you can still get growth and and prevent\nAnd protect your money from the market volatility moving into a a bear market\nSo increasing your portfolio beating inflation beating cash being safe money alternatives is something that has double digit returned potential with no risk\nI think that's a pretty smart strategy I think and we know that most of the people that are wealthy love to use it because they love to take money off of there but one thing that I learned as a stockbroker years ago was you'd never get hurt if you take a profit\nI like that but you can get hurt if you leave it in their let it ride because you never know when the market's going to return to equilibrium and it always does like you said the shoe may drop it always does feel like a retirement readiness review to see if you're taking too much risk or if you can reduce your risk and still get

to its your money I'm Jeff ... prisoners from my retirement planning a wealth management pulling back the curtain on the seven things that investing some things that rich people do\nThat you can do to here it's like a ... a comeback or if I don't ...\nWell [noise] final segment we've got to talk about three subject really quick we talked a little bit about Social Security I think we don't want to ban in that one we want to remember remind people\nI'm about ... you know the techniques that you use or the decisions that you make regarding Social Security could cost you or make you\nTens of thousands of dollars that's common forty or fifty thousand dollars difference than just the way you take your plan sometimes a hundred thousand dollars if you take advantage of certain I hate to use the word loophole 'cause it's really not a loophole it's the law it's a great advantage of\nThe structure of the legal way something is set up they call loophole because people don't tend to look into it and find out that they are they just take a genius\nValue that I can just kind of taking it at my phone retirement age I'm going to take it early but they don't understand the ramifications of that decision\nRight if you take Social Security earlier than the full retirement age you're going to take twenty five percent less\nIncome per month or per year but you're going to get for extra years or five extra years of income and that's good now the offset is is if I don't take my Social Security until I'm Seventy then I get a an eight percent growth from your full retirement age\nUp to eight Seventy so if your full retirement age of sixty six an extra four years increases thirty two percent\nYou're talking about two thirds more money\nThan if you took it at age sixty two but here's the ... the big question is do I have enough money to bridge that gap right am I going to keep working do I have to use on my social or do I have to use all my investments up maybe it's not a bad thing or maybe it's a good thing depending on the matter\nThere maybe some other strategies that you might be able to capitalize on if you were married divorced and we can you know when you come in and we can talk a little bit more about your particular situation\nRight and I think instead of belaboring all the different techniques here let's just a you know offer that you know as a you know something that you can do is call us for that five point I'm Social Security um analysis\nIs to claim their benefits how to coordinate claiming benefits with your spouse how you could eliminate or pay fewer taxes on the benefits that is by controlling what's on your tax return by tax writers we've already talked about and then um how to get a void how to avoid also getting gouged by the Medicare premiums remember all those four different levels of premiums\nAnd also if you're eligible for other benefits there's over five hundred ways you can choose\nTo take Social Security and uh you may not even know some of them exist we have some really close off where they'll uncover some of those so if you like to come in for that five point Social Security ... analysis or give us a call in fact I think for the first time caller we should do it um and a free one yeah okay [noise]\nSo for the first time caller she want to Social Security now says to find out when your optimum time has to take that or give us a call you know what we should let's add something we risk ally so that share we just talked about risky how ... how you know what do they fight we want people come and just for a review but some of these other services are pretty cool\nThe risk allies will actually look at your a total portfolio find out how much risk you're taking\nCompared to how much risk in your mind you should be taking rise you're going to know your risk tolerance and there's a little weird we can do\nYou think versus my reality as\nAnd you'll find out how diversified or how that risk number really works and how much you might be susceptible to losing the next market correction so [noise] um yeah I think that risk allies is really cool things will come in for a risk allies tests as well and find out if you're taking too much risk and I can protect the money from the next market\nAnd I just wanted to tell on that that when if that is something that you're interested in and we would need joy statements fan your account as well as for the Social Security would need to bring in white your numbers are at sixty two six year full retirement age\nOf ... and we can't do without some day so and and we'll send you a

component for the wealthy they take they take that seriously and they really do understand what their options are\nSo the last two that we want to cover and the next few minutes is um they want a is a state planning make sure your status protect that we ... we talked a little bit about memory or on about\nHow estate planning isn't just when both of you are dead and trying to leave or a state out appropriate and that's it sometimes people think well I just don't want to put everything in a trust I'm fine well what about succession planning\nFor a spouse in case you die early what about making sure your kids or grandkids have college educations you can set trusts up and plans that will create a legacy that you can leave behind\nA wealthy people do that and wealthy people I think live a retirement live with more peace of mind knowing that they have those contingency set up should they pass away early and should they leave a certain amount of assets in the family they want to keep it in the family not let it go disappear through the court system\nOr through probate or through taxes or through whatever other things might might habits so\nYou know some of the estate planning mistakes I think people do is they they they they assume that they will get some out of prey that's probably the most common one a will is they probate document probate takes over two years in Arizona on average and it can cost according to an AARP study that was done for Twenty years ago it could cost ten percent or more of the estate and believe me\nWith four or five hundred dollar an hour legal

Nathan is a member of the national\nAssociation of insurance and financial advisors promoting sound financial planning right here in the Tucson area [noise]\nAnd now here to talk with you about worry free financial solutions and retirement and your host Nathan Frederica\nWelcome to worry free financial solution [noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president ... Mayfield financial any data protection services incorporated an asset in retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nHave you ever been in a situation where you felt uneasy\nFor been put in a situation that's high risk perhaps just before you jump out of an airplane or dive into shark infested waters all things I can assure you I never do sorry just not my cup of tea and I realized that some of their loved the adrenalin rush that can come from things like that\nBut for most of us we don't like that feeling we don't like to feel vulnerable or feel an easy about something but how about financial risks where you might financially feel vulnerable again there's those that like these risks and the gambles maybe they bet on sporting events or at the casino\nAnd then there's those that leave everything up to Wall Street where some of the biggest financial risks can be\nAnd the scariest part is that a lot of the time if you have an investment portfolio you don't even know what's in it so for retirement planning you want to have the right amount in your portfolio that has protected and safe\nAnd then the right amount that you can risk it's about balance\nWall Street would have you believe that they are the only place where you can find this balance\nThey threw out words like modern portfolio theory an asset diversification as ways to try to convince you that your portfolio is in fact balance the truth is that's not what having a safety first approach is all about\nTrue balance comes from having a part of your portfolio that isn't in any sort of Wall Street fund at all\nHere's the facts Wall Street is great at the risk game sure you can get big gains see huge returns when things are good but at what cost you've got to be willing to ride the ups and downs along the way\nThis is acceptable when you're still working and you're a ways off from retirement you're still buying and re investing along the way it goes over time history does show us that it will come back it might take time but eventually it'll come back\nBut what if you're close to retirement perhaps are already retired well the stock market and Wall Street is not where you want to rely one hundred percent of your money on\nWall Street just isn't in safety business they never have and never will be that's not what they do\nDid you know that so far in two thousand Eighteen and yes we are still on the tail end of a ten year bull market run the three biggest point drops in the history of the Dow Jones industrial average have all happened in two thousand and Eighteen\nVolatility is back in a big way\nSo as you get older you probably start to look at risk and a little bit different way than you did when you were younger risk is now no longer just a bunch of numbers\nOr what kind of volatility you can bear but it's also a risk of your livelihood or your future livelihood your lifestyle\nThe money you've saved in your four one K. or your IRA or in other savings accounts it's what you've been working on saving for your entire life\nYou don't want that to go away or have your four O. one K. turn into what they call sometimes a two oh one K. which happened right after two thousand and one when the stock market crash and in two thousand eight after the stock market crashed\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial we don't advised to our clients to rely one hundred percent on Wall street and that's where our safe money programs here at ...\nYou want a place a portion of your portfolio into safety and remove the downside risk completely for that part of your portfolio the part that you need to protect and keep safe that part that you need to be there when you want it\nAnd then you can still have that part of your portfolio that you can afford to risk and for every person there is a different amount to having safety or in our state money program and then the amount that you have at risk on Wall street\nNow for the safe portion that doesn't mean that we eliminate that potential to keep that money growing because there's still a potential to do that it just means that we can reduce the influence of Wall Street and provide some more certainties in ever uncertain financial world\nWell for one a safe money portfolio cannot lose money to any stock market volatility that's right it can't lose money to the stock market\nSafe money also offers guaranteed growth options it has beneficiary transfer a veil ability it can be held in an IRA or ... or even just regular saving money\nAnd if you're over fifty nine and a half and plan on still working most four O. one K. is allow you to roll over your retirement money into a safe money IRA the key of having safe money is that financial security that it can bring to your retirement plan now we\nMoney to stock market money or risk money because there are two separate things they're designed for two separate purposes and we're not trying to pit one against the other so to save money so offered growth absolutely yes it does\nWell safe money is no get rich quick schemes it does offer security and stability and growth which is exactly what you're looking for as you retire\nIf you're looking for more information on this safe money and what I'm Talking about today and you want to know more we make it easy for you we have a book here and it's called safe money it's a book that we've offered for years to our listeners right here in Tucson to get it at absolute no charge to you\nCall eight six six seven for nine seven two three three and just ask for your safe money book this one hundred and Thirteen page book contains plenty of sound retirement planning advice about how to keep your money safe\nIt talks about us treasuries and the bond market and annuities and what options are available in the financial world today to keep your money safe\nIt's an easy to read book how having financial security\nIs key to your retirement plan so again to get your book called eight six six seven for nine seven two three three or you can visit us on line at Mayfield safe money dot com or base right here in Tucson, Arizona\nNow yes don't get me wrong the stock market still is one of the most powerful tools available when it comes to growing your money there's absolutely no doubting that\nHowever that requires an ability for you to ride out the ups and downs that come with it because Wall Street is one of the absolute worst places to keep your money when you need to protect it which is usually about five years before and anytime after you retire\nYou see Wall Street isn't in the safety business they never were and they never will be when Wall Street rises and when it goes up that's what's called a bull market it's a stair step up at inches higher and higher and higher this\nCurrent bull market is now officially the longest in us history it's easy to get caught up in the excitement the games the trillion dollar market caps\nHowever just as bull markets climbed the stairs bear markets are when markets fall well they jumped out the window\nHistory has shown that time and time again it's easy to see this from past markets the crash in eighty seven the dot com bubble bursting in the two thousand one and two thousand to the financial meltdown of two thousand eight\nThese crashes happen quickly it's that bear market jumping out the window\nAnd when that bear market does come again and it will come someday believe you me are you prepared to see all these recent gains possibly disappear\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial safe money become so crucial to your financial security\nThe fact is and I've said this before on this radio program that if you're in your fifties and sixties right now you will most likely go through three to four more bear market in your lifetime so don't let that threaten your financial security\nI had a client in my office just the other day and his retirement was just around the corner literally it was just ...\nIt's four O. one K. he had saved and contributed and kept adding to it and getting his employer match and everything that can come with a four one K. if you're lucky enough to have one\nAnd in the past this client of mine had seen their fair share of ups and downs but now they were ready to move that part of their portfolio to safety\nNot to take them out of the game but to provide that financial security they needed because\nIn the plan that we came up with here at Mayfield financial was that even if this market kept going up that's okay with my client their state money portfolio still going to grow gonna keep going up\nBut the main goal in the main purpose was to protect that part of his portfolio and their money\nSo it would not lose anything if this market or to take a tumble that is the key to having peace of mind to having a worry free financial plan that is key to that financial security that we all strive for here at Mayfield financial\nSo if all of your retirement is in Wall Street or a brokerage account are\nYou properly plan and set up to have the absolute best plan going forward\nIf not and this safe money concept sounds interesting to you or you'd like to know more we'd love to help you at Mayfield financial like I said a little bit earlier we've offered a book to our listeners for the past few years that contains some of these things that I talk about on the radio how to keep your money safe\nHow to protect it from Wall street volatility from Wall street fees how to keep it growing and how that safe money can provide you with

only to have it rolled back down every time he got close to the top sound familiar using our no market risk advanced planning saving for retirement is like riding up an escalator [noise]\nAt times are planning was safe money can create income streams that last a lifetime or they can be used to provide principle protection with growth and then come later there's all sorts of different options and flexible terms because everyone is different everyone has a different retirement plan in different needs\nFor example many of our clients here at Mayfield financial are seeing incredible gains due to the stock market rally we've seen over the last few years even in a safe money portfolio\nThey save money portfolios are designed for growth and for safety\nMany of our plans can harness the power of the stock market with out the risk that the market can bring on an annual basis one markets rise they save money plans also increase in value\nBut if markets fall you don't give up what you already gained in previous years but if the market does fall you don't get any gains in that year either so the worst that you could do is a zero loss but he's zero gain\nSo let's say the stock market goes up another ten percent from here well that's great we welcome it here at Mayfield financial in a safe money plan designed for growth over that year you'd see about five percent gain\nOnce you earn it you keep it is the famous saying here gain and retain\nThat let's say in twenty twenty the stock\nMarket finally decides to take a turn for the other direction and markets are down a whopping thirty to forty percent\nWell you're safe money growth portfolio won't lose a dime and you didn't have to give back that gain you had in previous years so the worst you could do even if the market did take a tumble is a zero loss and his zero gain\nThan let's say after that big drop in that big bear market the market starts to recover and the market shoots up thirty percent as we bounce off that bear market and have a nice recovery\nWhile you get about a Fifteen Percent gain in that year that's the power of zero losses you don't have to go up and down with the market you can go up when the market goes up and you stay flat when the market goes down\nBecause you never lose your money keeps growing and your nest egg stay safe so if this is the kind of opportunity that sounds interesting to you

want to have is it a higher priority to leave a legacy for your\nAre others or do you want to preserve your current lifestyle and be comfortable and then if there's something leftover ensure let 'em have it or maybe you just want to know if you will even be able to buy a loaf of bread\nMost of us are right in that middle range we want to be able to continue our lifestyle to be comfortable and have the freedom and security and knowing that are essential needs are met and we still have some left over for the niceties of life this is after all is what retirement is all about and as for\nNow do all investment advisors offered this unfortunately no this type of planning or the planning that looks to take care of your essential needs first it's often not addressed\nIn this Wall Street dominated financial world that we're in too many investment advisers and individuals try to seek sky high returns and run the odds it's all probability based it's about calculating risk\nAnd hoping that a worst than worst case scenario won't ever happen during your retirement\nTo me and for all of us here at Mayfield financial that simply doesn't work\nI don't like running probabilities when it comes to retirement\nI Want certainties I Want guarantees I Want a retirement plan that puts safety first and where risk isn't measured by what stocks and bonds you have in your portfolio but as measured by the risk of losing your comfort\nYour house your income\nThese types of risks are the real risks we want to consider when planning for retirement\nSo there are many questions to answer when it comes to knowing what to do with your retirement money in your savings and how to best position yourself for the long term so what is the answer\nWell it depends it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met and want to continue the lifestyle that we're comfortable with throughout retirement\nSo here at Mayfield financial we are a safety

Ben gets a dumb question every show I'm going to make it a a a dumb statement how's that I'm sure you\nDo well my advice to you as a professional in my field don't ever read your own press okay [laughter]\nI'll do that for years so I go to the vice channel I'm looking at the comments section about you know your your Jack Ryan feature and it's just full of haters solo yeah let's address this right now how why would a CIA\nGuy come out and claimed to be a CIA guy ... that's what I Do yeah\nYeah absolutely in fact uh the everything that I said in that vice video was cleared through the CIA publication review board and here's the thing like people gotta pick up a book\nAnd stop watching movies I'm right there are so\nMany CIA operatives case officers special agents who've written books and talked about this I mean it's everybody from\nYou know Bob Baer to I Can't really think of any of the real names off the top of my head um you know Valerie Plame's name many of these many of these people are and it's because\nIt is the topic of CIA this is not some some uh some secret it's not the agency it's the Central Intelligence agency right so it's not a secret that the CIA exist it's a secret who is covertly working for the CIA right now ...\nWhy we can't we can't tell you that we can't tell you what city there in what time they are going to be on what street corner but the fact that they worked for the CIA and they did operations overseas that's not exactly a design jak with classified information\nOkay we've got about four minutes for the next break I tell you that Nick one thing that really touched me because we've had lots of warriors and sheep dogs on the show and\nYou know one of the phrase I I've always stuck with me is but then when it comes to the military when a member of the military deploys the whole family deploys\nAnd and there's a segment and this vice video where you talk about that you are correct me if I'm wrong but you didn't know anybody in your line of work who is still married I mean divorce was very common and your line of work and\nAnd you luckily found a new a new woman who was a bunch of going to be your bride but you face a decision you had to decide okay which and you're going to you're going to say about it either but what's\nMore important to the world but I remain a in the CIA or that I become a good father and and ... sure what the sort of your thought process at that point in your life\nSure and so uh I came back from last car got Afghanistan to find ... divorce papers in my inbox basically my entire life pulled out from underneath me and\nIt happened while I was on deployment and what I what I quickly learned is that there are dirt bag attorneys and I use that word very specifically who never served\nAnd who essentially their business is going after veterans and trying to take everything that they have from them and so I learned very quickly that my my status as a veteran was going to be used against me in court\nMy status as a as a you know is the operative at the CIA was going to be against used against me in court\nAnd so I\nI very quickly had to decide what was more important\nAnd at the end of the day like I Know buddies special I'm a guy who happened to get through some really cool selection process is by the sheer grace of God I happened to be picked up and be worn out one percent that the CIA hires and that's a great\nBut it's not like the war on terror was was we were going to lose it if I let the agency but\nYou know who would lose if I didn't leave the agency and leave that lifestyle would be my son\nSo I knew that if if I truly cared about being a good father and truly cared about giving my son the best chance for success then I had to make a choice between being a spy and being in debt\nAnd I would like to tell you that I'm such a big person that that was really really easy choice it was it it was incredibly hard because the agency has its problems like any other government bureaucracy but at the end of the day it's a cool place to work with\nA lot of people who were incredibly right\nIt was it difficult decision but it was the right decision one I'd gotten out like\nRegret boxes or ... year we're joined by Nick McKinley Nick is the CEO and founder of the deliver fun Nick I might have just sort of plant a seed I Want to check in our next segment when we come back I spent ten years of my life volunteering with a non profit that work with homeless teens in St catch\nAnd homeless teens generally try very hard\nFor people not to be able to recognize that they're that they're homeless because they're they're the most victimized the homeless population but I got to a point where I'm confident you can drop me in any city United States\nThis is all happening on why you know the all the advertising the transaction the uh the money processing it's all happening through the Internet so you don't have significant\nCapability to exploit what is happening on the Internet then you just can't get to the bottom of what's happening or in the human trafficking market in a scalable\nWay so what we do it delivered find is we use the\nAdvertisements that these traffickers are using to to essentially to advertise it\nAnd the Internet is their storefronts were we just trace those advertisements back because we understand how the Internet works we've got the professional training in it and\nQuite frankly we're smarter than they are mhm at combine that with the with the incredible cyber tools that our partners that shadow dragon and case where has put together\nWe have reason we've created a methodology where law enforcement officers can track\nA human trafficker to an actual physical location or if we can get the track or we can usually get the victim to a physical location within a period of about six hours\nOn that is that it's all it's all cyber base that everybody likes to think that oh a bunch of former Jay sock and and CIA guys going after human traffickers you must be kicking doors with ... on it you know nature rolling through windows no\nActually Ninety eight percent of the time we don't even leave our keyboards that we do some physical surveillance when it's needed but most of the time if you've got the right the right people the right capabilities and the rights brain power\nYou don't actually need to ever leave your keyboard to find out where these guys are\nNick one thing that disturbs and I'm so I cannot tell you how glad I Am that you and your cameras are out there doing this\nBut how many ... my my head around something in the introduction I I read the thirteenth amendment is specifically says Congress shall have the urban versus article\nInappropriate ledge legislation which to me means funding but I I Can't find a single federal agency I'm not as smart as you that is doing this [laughter] ... where am I wrong on line\nOr a you're not you're not in a major you're in Arizona right correct so in Arizona\nI'm probably within arm's reach you've got Alcohol Tobacco and firearms and yet we have a bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and firearms that's responsible\nFor fighting the illicit sale of what is what our legal commodities we have a drug enforcement agency Ninety percent of drugs are actually legally sold yeah\nWe have an entire government\nBureaucracy that's responsible for fighting to say you know for fighting the sale of illicit drugs yet one\nHundred percent of human slavery is illegal\nAnd you can't point to a single government bureaucracy that has the ball wow and that's a problem not only is it a priority problem for us as a country but it's a character problem for us as a political constituency so why is it that we are not holding our politicians accountable\nFor the fact that we don't have a centralized brain for fighting human trafficking in the United states what happens and I I when I was working at the CIA I assume that somebody was doing something about this right I mean we can kill people\nWith flying robots for six thousand miles away\nSurely somebody's going to be doing something about the human trafficking issue\nYet go ask go ask your PJ friends whose mission is personnel recovery ask them how many human trafficking related missions they've done\nTheir answer will be zero go ask your seals go ask\nGo ask everybody in the special ops community go ask your agency people NSA everybody though I'll tell you not it's the local law enforcement officer or the local sheriff's deputy this\nInvestigators in your attorney general's office those are the ones that are doing the heavy lifting against human trafficking is a couple of federal agents there helping them and a couple of federal agents over here helping that but there's nobody is doing at Central coordination\nAnd one of the things that we learned in the war on terror that you have to have a centralized coordination so we have the counterterrorism center\nOther like organization that is they're sharing information with everybody who's in the fight\nWhoa that's essentially what we have developed that deliver fight we are at a centralized brain\nThat is coordinating sheriff's deputy in Texas where a Atlanta police department a detective in Atlanta with a investigator at the Arizona attorney general's office and we are sharing that information and helping them be able to coordinate\nCases against these human traffickers as\nThey travel Nick when we come back I Want you to further highlight that point by telling us the story of Samantha folks if you've visited deliver
