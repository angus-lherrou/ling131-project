particular item some specific items [noise] and more broadly\nI was also looking at Matt Damon in my ... my late again kicking into that you know ah Matt Damon was the star is a movie star you know of a film called promised land\nAnybody or nobody thought it's a film called the promised land and a promised land as a film about the evils of fracking and it's a fictionalized account of fracking now it was funded by a I'm a UA eat the United Arab Emirates by a a\nA Dubai Abu Dhabi or oil money behind because they don't want us a developing our natural gas or our\nEnergy sector because that will be bad for their economy so they funded Matt Damon script a promised land which is full of lies about fracking natural gas all that stuff\nHysterical science fiction from Hollywood funded by the uh you ... the United Arab Emirates or because they have a political agenda obviously and that is they want us to be buying our oil from them or buying their oil from them\nAnd uh and so he's cook it on so many different levels you know [noise]\nAll right let's go to a President Trump President Trump\nOver the weekend\nA on the Brett Kavanaugh deal and the FBI investigation\nActually this could be a blessing in disguise because we I\nAnd do a thorough investigation whether it's three days in seven days I think it's going to be less than a week but having them do it ... should I actually think will be a blessing in disguise it will be a good thing\nIt may it may be but the Democrats are only using this as a device to come up with new claims of racism and pedophilia\nAnd gay the accused him of being gay before they're done uh and uh it's about it's about stopping the nomination Lindsey Graham he's in a tizzy these days and he's talking about and I like this investigating the Democrats and they're corrupt role in this whole process\nTook on a bill wholesale full scale investigation for that night with a despicable process to deter it from happening at the yeah\nThat is a really good idea and I'm a hundred percent in favor of that Tom Cotton is an American hero um it said it's a borrowed line but\nCooking who have done this\nOne running or not it's not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp two parties there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nThere is no currency there's no incentive to rich across the aisle he's leaving the uh the TV business I'm In the Senate\nAnd uh and\nHe says he wouldn't have been able to undermine his own party if he had been staying and to couch tired of the Democrats but he's looking for a multimillion dollar job and that's that's\nHow this works I guess let's go to Matthew Miller Matthew Miller I is a an Obama administration official who is now employed by NBC News just like John Brennan who voted for communist for president of the United states\nAnd Matthew Miller he was on the television this morning at the circle fast with the pigeons sisters on MORNING joke\nAnd uh he's asked well what about the FBI investigation gosh and again he's an Obama administration official not pretending to be a journalist or a commentator or something like that\nAnd they pay him at NBC to so the Democrat Party line while pretending to be an object of something or other\nWhen they know perfectly well that he's not and the FBI investigation well it's not nearly brought I Know we agreed on friday to one week and I have a scope surrounding what we discussed and Eric\nBut we just through all that out because we're really really dishonest\nFBI knows exactly what's going on here that they're being used by the White House what are the White House wants them to get a good a good housekeeping staff approval and act you know the investigation being limited from the outset where it can only\nI have what are the White House wants them to get a good a good housekeeping staff approval and act you know the investigation being limited from the outset where it can only kind of produce the pre ordained outcome you can go look at everything\nWhat now there's no but everybody sits there nodding in agreement first of all it's a good housekeeping seal of approval not the good housekeeping stamp of approval I don't know what\nContinent you grew up on but this Obama administration official or is just uh we usually little hack and he's kind of creepy he's like a vampire and you know this guy\nIs kind of a creepy a little man and he looks like a vampire and ... and and and the scope is exactly what the Democrats insisted upon it's precisely what is just sort of ... and now they're minions they're flying monkeys like this little monkey boy\nAnd so many other uh they uh they just changed the terms they just throw out the term so I I Know what we agreed to but we were lying you know us we're relying at the time\nAnd we had no intention for a moment\nOf sitting by and letting this investigation just take a week this is about delaying about postponing\nThis is about just drawing a family an American family that worked hard kept their nose clean those to the grindstone you know squeaky life and that doesn't matter because we've got a storm of fecal contamination here that will destroy the world before we allow this to happen\nUh Matthew Miller he's a Democrat and he said well the the White House didn't this is one of the lives they invented and they just ... again\n... Joseph ... Hitler's propagandist was a biker compared to these people I mean that I'm not embellishing that's not sometimes I like to embellish and exaggerate I'm not exaggerating I'm not\n[noise] that's how big allies are here gigantic the White House is using the FBI the FBI was asked by the Democrats to investigate but they needed White House approval\nBecause the FBI is an executive branch agency and doesn't work for the Congress the Congress is already investigating I Know that and they lie about that being irrelevant because they live all the time\nAnd a and here's Matthew Miller and and I said it's a they want the ah good he's keeping housekeeping um stamp of approval he says and this is so limited it's not limited\nThey're they're just they couldn't be more full of it and now they're starting conspiracy theories and this guy this Obama administration rancor Matthew Miller\nHe worked at the Justice Department which was so corrupt during Obama under\nHolder Michael Brown an\nDarren Wilson who's still in hiding because of the murderous threats of the Democrats and uh I well you know the Justice Department under Brock Obama Loretta Lynch and the and the phony dossier and uh this guy I I just smell corruption is he smells like corruption all over the place\nSo he's got conspiracies peddling conspiracies now\nAnd uh the White House is using the FBI now again you do what the Democrats ask you to do your call for a White House investigation and then they accuse you of using the FBI to rubber stamp your investigation\nYou can't deal with people like this in a normal rational fashion and that's why I'm concerned things are going to get really bad and when a Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court because they're smear\nLynch job is not going to work because the FBI is going to find out that there's just no there are there\nIs not going to work because the FBI is going to find out that there's just no they're they're on they've got three Democrat accusations Dr Ford who the Democrats ginned up she she she popped up out of the would pile\nBut then the Democrats held her and reserve and they abuse the hell out of her and and she's pixilated then they know it and they got her left wing activist lawyers and they got her the go fund me pages and they stood up this whole organization around her\nAnd uh that one has she can't remember anything she's got the IRS\nAnd I can't remember stuff I'll say that I Can't remember stuff she's got the arrest or the woman can't remember things from two months ago\nAnd you're going to hang somebody based on something she's remembering it's like a money python skit\nHer story is like a bounty pythons get and the Democrats they got everybody all whipped up across the country where they are opening their own veins and things\nThat's completely nuts and there will be violence when he is or when he has confirmed that he will be confirmed the left will become via their violent all the time when they're sitting there being quiet and just in between violent episodes\nAnd then there's the Ronan Farrow story which the New York times uh tried their damned dust to confirm\nInterviewing more than thirty six people they said\nMany of whom said oh yeah we talked to her what's that's Ramirez and Romero's called her friends last week and told her friends well I don't even remember if it was Kevin or not but somebody rag Darwinian my face when I was a freshman at Yale so I'm going to go to running for the New Yorker and say it was Kavanaugh\nAnd that's how that when I mean that really is it in a nutshell I'm not even being unfair\nI'm a I'm I'm Brett siding with the New York times said and why they didn't go with the story\nAnd then of course there is the the industrial a judge or weeds style ISIS scale\nA drug gang with quite loads certain teenage girls in the punch bowl with quite loads and then pulling the train woo woo choo choo Charlie was an engineer and he went to Georgetown Prep and they're asking you to believe this\nAnd and if you believe this year very dumb you're a very dumb person at the third one in particular I mean on that one specifically if you believe that was what what was going on at Georgetown Prep parties with Fifteen year olds based on the testimony of a woman who was committing a series of felonies by being there\n[laughter] contributing delinquency of miners gang rapes ... uh the drugs the alcohol the sexual assaults a and is a woman who was at that time of the age of majority there for a legal adult\nShe is guilty of a long list of felonies based on what she testified to in porn lawyers little deposition\nSo uh this guy Matthew Miller listen to this has got more conspiracies on again he was he worked at the very corrupt Loretta Lynch Obama Justice department where there were leaking stuff and using the ... and all that stuff and he's predicting more bad things\nI don't think the FBI is going to take very kindly to being Donald Trump pappy especially after the path Eighteen months on his attack them and undermine them so I I I guarantee you will the morally from the bureau of what the limits are on this investigation\nAnd whether they can actually get to the truth which is their job and ... which is what they would like to do\nYeah that like you guys um guarantee you will see more leaks you remembered Chuck Schumer is saying that the uh the intelligence community will screw ya six ways to Sunday or something like that remember that a Alison camera to pretend to be\nThe intelligence community will screw ya six ways to Sunday or something like that remember that a Alison Jim Rada pretends to be a journalist she is employed by the time Warner corporation\nAnd see an end the big guy and they're very upset that the Democrats another just throughout the agreement on friday and they've started over again and the media are are there water carriers\nThe FBI is investigating the planes against Brett Kavanaugh but is it a real investigation\nTrump says the bureau hasn't rain to look into sexual misconduct allegations against his Supreme Court nominee but certainly sell CNN the White House is narrowing the focus and controlling the self\nWith the help of Senate Republicans and there are reports this morning the witnesses when stories to tell about Brett Kavanaugh's behavior are trying to reach the FBI but they are having trouble doing so they're\nOn the Internet has he might do so no one died and I like\nThe church downtown and\nHe's singing says it's still part of his act but NBC News NBC I keep calling you know there as corrupt\nGovernment to do it they demolished the black family then you've got the ah forty percent abortion rights so then all of your make it through the uh that trap and
