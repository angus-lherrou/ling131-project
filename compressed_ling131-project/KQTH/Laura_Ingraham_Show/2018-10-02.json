directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I Am a medical idiot okay [laughter] but ah\nI've actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years and what I Am hearing even as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press in they find several different pricing models\nThe money you have already heard\nNoble financial services are registered investment advisor\nFor one cake you th Tucson news and talk\nTo everybody is Laura Ingraham today with the latest news you mean by following up on Facebook and Twitter and one oh four one K. two teenage sons news and tone\nFamily couldn't keep up the house so he's moved in it and they're paying the mortgage and\nWanting to know what to do what they should fool with us or not\nIt's my wife so great grandma so I Know where I live on the lowest say there was a it's a hundred and three ... know if that's even ... they're not\nOr nothing like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nI just being okay by it's not like you're getting the right great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride yeah this is I'm not sure if I'm\nLike to even get kicked out because someone gated or should I leave or I should I'm where I should I go back ran over\nWell where no one on the long term with it\nYou want to own um\nWell my wife she we kinda do want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got every angle I only like an area it's\nLike I say my wife great grandma's house has she been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about\nTwo and a half three acres mhm\nAnd um it's kind of in a country well part of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are you to\nUh my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days so we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a a one child you said and how much debt that you have\nA we don't have any debt\nOkay and what's your household income\nI make a thousand a year but I'm trying to also get in school but I had to kind of work with the first answer that was how much I Want to ... um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month\nAnd your wife done more mhm okay that's pretty that's on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nYeah and we just found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from turkey recommended me start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kind of you know trying to start it off a little better any\nGood good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the errors or this would be great grandmother children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you'd have to get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold hand would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah don't\nWith all the with the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt they are going to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I because I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate because I Do construction and that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kinda is not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she\nYeah All right here's like other relatives staying there kind of beaten it up so I mean I don't know if it's like maybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying maybe we can slip in and get another house or am I Lived\nThere unless you become the owner of it\nAnd and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now my in my name or should I wait until you what I Would do\nWalk away from this house some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo uh what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment as rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today it's\nInexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be and it's going to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the heirs are\nYeah well\nI don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many on 'em\nOr that they actually know about it like I said we we may here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that if they are paying the oil and I just keep paying it\nIn because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYeah ... ... on his way like can't nobody coming to me out because it's not in my name\nYeah they can get you out the people that own it can there the air's but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're yeah they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and the water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before they had some something you know and to make my life had because\nThat's money whatever money you spend and make her happy money is\nGone when you leave 'cause there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are good is going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing to probate court\nAnd get the deed transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just look at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kind of like living\nAnd ah you know six hundred bucks written Atlanta is not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nUh it's not hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move\nOn quite worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner than getting ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but uh my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it\nMy guess is ill as probably fairly close on this if we thought his worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative sought his worth two hundred thousand bucks a Ninety thousand was owed\nTheir pocket when is old oh sharks would already been circling\nThey'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without away all you have to go in and the judge has to\nYou know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs are just like it would in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess and do you can't get clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become aware of it any other way\nAnd doing it properly and getting clean title 'cause you won't be able to do it if you don't get clean titled\nSo that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent it's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're gonna move off and you don't home not [noise] not any that's what you would do\nHope that helps my aunt's thanks for calling him this is Dave Ramsey shower\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it
