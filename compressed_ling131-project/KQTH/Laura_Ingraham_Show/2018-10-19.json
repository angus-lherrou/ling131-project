they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education that puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now in forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff\nOf staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the school\nYour business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations and personal finance curriculum from the rams the organization is that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things as happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore\nIs with me on the line and tile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle why and go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like you are cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct\nWow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world need more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that\nCan be anyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity independence of boldness\nAt pursuit adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right vessel decorate\nFootball team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as as good I play on words but you you guys got the you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love\nIt it's a great motto or does it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming\nWe're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have ... as a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical where state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college because sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line I've talked to a lot of ... around the country I'm\nMy own chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... Tennessee and it's a\nConstant thing and then ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a saying you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for our education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition of a doctoral ranting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south\nWe can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nThem in so many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over a twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nNow that's a good size school that's not too big and small and so that's a that's just right those are ... just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again brother thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nI Love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school\nNow if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it would be to the hospital used to go to\nSome states have more on the schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um you know maybe you just want to do it would be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day it's now a middle school\nSo I had all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me\nThat's the hardest speaking you'll ever have all this time um but now his Anthony all males got tough job you're all but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and you know if it wasn't and by the way that school

I feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return a leash car\nTo the dealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nWe take her car back that you owe money on our son to lease on that's effectively\nA voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb\nBecause they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it\nAnd the other ... repossession lot\nAnd then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the different she goes you're broke I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments blush residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off on the line when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nSo the early buyout as your hourly pay off now\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time so the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that\nTo KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole ... probably not far off of what you're going to find\nSo four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so his bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the difference is greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession\nAnd so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they ribs utility to borrow money no diversity is telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that and so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we've been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be intentional even with the little things there is one thing you can do right
