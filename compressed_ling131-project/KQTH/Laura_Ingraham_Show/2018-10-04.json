you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nYeah and we we had a couple of conversations are ...\nCall is very interesting topic this topic of financial infidelity read the magazine to the service of thirty eight percent of you lie to your spouse about money [noise]\nWow and you wonder why your marriage isn't topping out is uh Dawson\n[noise] now I mean it can be a little white lies the target bags under the bed\nSnickers snake or write or or it can be big Tom credit card debt it can\nBe one of you is running a business and is running up debt down at the business and\nNot telling your spouse because you're trying to live your dream minutes\nLet me just kinda clarified this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you didn't already know that did you [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] well\nI'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it goes up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller by quickly [laughter] so here's the thing\nIf you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase\nOr a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm also down talk churn hey I Want to buy this toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already\nPeople already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean on you and I collect guns by the way\nSo yeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're gonna find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those who've got too much too many like toys right\nAh for the grandkids and for the kids to play on and so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to share and about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to one of those\nGuns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there's not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not theirs and one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant\nImmature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden debt though it's the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and its shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation base hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you you are partially responsible does like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of your both of you should be\nStraight have weight once all the decisions are made but every body ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who had almost been on Oprah more than anybody Oprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we can get on I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a\nSixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air\nAnd Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I'd been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we got our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] that's what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not love and his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof he's freaking clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially his fault and he owes earn apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand or with a bat and he don't even know what the blips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegate in business you would always inspect what you expect\nYou would never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is a marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture he said now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding that he got eighty grand and debt that he didn't know he had and oh man it looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm standing on making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time that you just did you just dumping on it and then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away and close your eyes\nAnd what we'll do the ... well yeah you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nDidn't work out well the rest of the show but we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb\nFolks who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together where every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month of against a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about\nThree months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increased their level of communication\nTenfold increase their level of cooperation tenfold increase their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize\nThey began to agree on their goals and their productivity what their money goes through the roof ... you'll feel like you've got a raise when you've learned through this together\nOn paper on permission before the month begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software for every dollar to less fat for your phone every dollar value of every dollar a name [noise]\nThat you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country\nTwo million when all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents in their markets in fact\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God looks down and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that could have happened was with us 'cause\nYou know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors and we were able to pay off with a much quicker radio a lot quicker than we thought because\nWe didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just looking at all the student loans we thought how are you going to pay this off how are we going to get home do all these different things start a family but um you know definitely goes on our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this and that was pretty good parents\nSo how how do you explain to other people will do I know I Know what the answer is but\nHow do you explain to other people the level of intensity that is required 'cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game all\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was a ... mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us then and we just had made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so\nI had and we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know and it was normal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life\nAnd certainly money's going to be a room mate for life\nRight why why do people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could fit into your life that we had just made the decision like you know art student loan which just astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we weren't really we were ready and willing to do I'm told to do those zero budget you know there's Iraq's and budget everything out every dollar hadn't assignment\nAnd every extra dollar went to a student loans though we were making payments like in the grand they're making payments to have a ... a month right we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so um you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nLive to two years like and that lifestyle you know but um I Would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to say I really had to praise through um just the ... of that type of lifestyle\nAnd really be uplifted in the spirit um to really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and you kind of he had countless hours turned out he worked countless hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days or weeks then months out of time um but he was just very focused and just stay prepared\nState in prayer to really I'm kind of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd those are the pains of it was it worth it early yet you're completely free yet good\nI Know what else should get out of this is like when you climb a wall that's that tall\nAnd I'm only going we can free can do anything [laughter]\nI mean there are ... me but I mean we can do anything\nI was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of your married life you know you didn't sit on the on the couch and watch Oprah reruns of wine is suck your thumb you went out killed at drug it home and paid off four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars in debt you all are so impressive\n[laughter] sounded pretty stinking cool we got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired we want that to be the next chapter in your story\nAnd it definitely will be outrageously generous and of course millionaires along the way so you're right on track to do all of that I'm so proud of you guys I Know your family's in I don't know your passwords proud of you to make sure you tell Robert ... story\n[laughter] I don't want to hear this yeah yeah\nI don't know what he wants to hear this I'm telling you I Love it All right guys way to go All right it's true 'cause in Virginia Dallas texas four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars but all been twenty four months making a hundred three hundred counted\nLet's say you're a dead for\nThree to one to be the gory where\n\nThey don't\nDon't you tell me 'cause I don't know too many of those [noise] those big rock\nStars used wish you were them man that's amazing well on you guys well done either some of every generation to decide the big losers not those two ... and not the ones I get to meet and you know that's an interesting thing you know what they did they just decided [noise]\nThey decided this is overwhelming it's scary and we're going to do something about it so what are you gonna do you're going to decide you're going to do something about a day to day baby just as the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each has dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die and that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting\nTerm life insurance just go to Sandra insurance

those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free\nFrom the bondage of the fence you're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victim eyes are free you're setting you yourself free\nYou can forgive someone and not be reconciled to them\nAnd lady called a minute ago and was trying to figure out how to should she reconnect with her brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting or brother in law after he had affairs and everything else and he supposedly come clean for the last two years\nHis wife has forgiven ham and taking him back and been reconciled to him but\nNot the sister in law she doesn't wanna be around it so here's the question at what point\nFor someone's misdeeds do you forgive them\nAnd then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy\nSomeone rapes you what a horrible grotesque violent unbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine can't imagine going say something like that\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars is to not say yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you when you do forgive them you set them free but you would not be reconciled ever\nTo someone who raped ... meaning you wouldn't go on a date with him you know someone steals your wallet you can forgive them but you're not gonna\nYou know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled with them probably ever in that situation but in the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong her\nYou know the guy's wife issue was wrong right and uh her sister in law was wrong\nOr brother in law I don't know how it worked out his brother in law but anyway as is letting it I guess her husband's family as a way I understood it but anyway the the lady that the the wife is who was wrong and she forgave animals reconciled to the husband as he supposedly just putting his life back together I don't mind me ideally but his life back together I don't know the guy I\nMean you don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it you know any one of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one\nI mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance like that I can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and reading my hands and be mad at him and worried about him\nDoesn't hurt her again on his wife I'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that is what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround is real\nSee we run into this all the time with her coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money and what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again\nAfter that\nIf you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously\nGonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially\nI'm a I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is ... is a you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families finance us on the ...\nSo he comes in he discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous and he's seeing his pastor and he's seeing a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that they not have control and they don't have any access to money for a while\nUntil trust us rebuild over time but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it should be better than it is now two years later I should be better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust and so if ten years later you you're still or you know you have not\nBet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again or you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're not going to treat you like you have no ability to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from you till you prove that you can have a little bit\nAbsolutely but then gradually trust is rebuilt and over time it's rebuilt\nIf you cannot when someone has\nOn something like we're talking about here ... ... ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not entering into\nThe negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you and two years clean if the guy's clean\nFrom his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing
