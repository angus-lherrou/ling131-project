D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nA Dave I'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we've got a B that three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through a few uh we coordinated it thank you and\nYeah and my ... when the ten percent [noise] but I hear you on your show the twenty percent you'd prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there then been one of those too so I'm just wondering what\nWhat makes the difference between ten and twenty or said\nOkay a good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage\nOkay not one All right uh the end when somebody's buying a second home I pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down twenty percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down and you have what's called an eighty percent loan and our eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you where the standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. I. J. loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. stands for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\n... so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay at ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you were in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone if you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down you get ... on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the P. M. I. when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company ... of and then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly\nHigh compared to this country make any difference\nKnow it doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay I don't want your map doesn't count you know we don't do that so you ...\nThere's still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just because you're in California they don't like okay you ... you know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're the higher the whole process market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent\nI'm not requiring twenty percent but you get to you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have this thing to me I Am I\nYeah I mean because you had are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you\nRight so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent then keep counting on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWithin appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PM I dropped so you're not known for Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can 'cause then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer doing baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well those of us that\nAre in tune with being smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up\n[noise] okay so I'm twenty five ah I've I've done pretty well for myself\nUh I had a dilemma though my ... cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred bucks to ask thirty eight model what the big game in it and it's a hot yes I paid well below Kelley Blue book value and I have\nFive to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and I've been listening to you and going through your baby steps if he won't be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and you use the money to finish my murders based on\nWhat is your and what is your car worth a private market is twenty three who I think\nAnd and you said you're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars invested a retirement or have no credit card\nDebt mhm no I don't know what are you single I'm Single and what's your income\nBy a gum is about forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime\nIs this your only dead on the car\nThat's my only debt and how much do you do on it\nOh sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one steps\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year or maybe you have no life but you get to keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that Dave out of the ... yeah I get I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand an ear and making fifty grand if you're single ...\nYes sir I keep the car okay\nLet me tell you how to let me tell you how do the analysis is not how much you love the car or a little card is although both are valid because it is\nOkay let me tell you how\nTo let me tell you how do they tell us it's just not how much you love the car or how cool a card is although both are valid cause it as a seriously cool car but the analysis is this can you be debt free up your house and under two years the answer\nIs yes and all your vehicles with a total of all your vehicles was less less than half of your annual income and the answer is fairly yes and you really love the\nShow you're willing to fight for cheap and don't have more than half your annual incomes hot up especially goes on in values is from one car guy to another caller guy\nOkay I got lots of cars so they are less than one percent of my worst show just your son I have toys go get some money first and then you can have toys and this is that I ...

my husband and I live right I'm so excited well I'm honored to speak with you how can I help\n[noise] well I Am wondering my husband and I have five children together ah he has three children from a previous marriage and I have two children I'm a previous marriage and we are currently on baby step number two\nAnd we just have a few thousand dollars left to go before we're able to kiss our debt goodbye mhm and so we are planning on a\nYou know helping our children are calling as much as we can ... and with five of them we realize that could be a significant expense and all five children currently have\nFive twenty nine plans that had been funded by cash gifts and things they received from their grandparents over the years good\nUm so his boys are are significantly for it\nSo his boys are are significantly further in math and my girls are my girls are quite a bit younger [laughter] um but we just kind of want maybe around about ... on what we should plan for each child or how to how each child through college because I feel like\nIt could be such an enormous amount of money with five of them but we also want to help them out as much as they can sell\nOkay there's a couple of ways you can calculated um as far as your target amounts and if you know your target amounts you're wise to ask for that then you can back into how much you need to be doing\n... the ones that got a little bit of a head start 'em they may be a little bit older are so it might come out fairly even I don't know spends on how much of a head start there is and it also depends on where you're thinking about going to school so\nIf I were in your shoes it doesn't sound like what's your household income\n... I'm a little over a hundred thousand [laughter] okay are you guys millionaires\nAnd we are not yet okay but you're on your way we are I mean here's the thing five kids going to school how old are they what's age range\nAnd that's where every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah I always like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and they all like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and go that route I'm that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing this stuff that we talk about for a while and yeah we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nA wedding we're going to be generous with some of the money and uh so the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that uh it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm I'm all up she said yes we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about on a debit card for that and then you know I I think he just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years and what are the steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\n... how much are you going to spend on what's it take to keep the car running gas wise\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then just just take this income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some apple or set up for like um a merger Soufan and the ... like a car like emergency fond of are you going to your car stuff you have things we do have savings going on about ten percent of his ... home we put in your savings Warren\n... well no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean not so Couzin dollars aside as ... bond and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I'd have a fully funded emergency fond of three to six months of expenses in his case he be rich if he had no debt and five ... five grand and savings Whitney\nYeah it'd be really well off so\n... and ... and then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and those kinds of things and even start talking about maybe some additional saving so he can have his own place\nOkay thank you very much\nHey thank you for calling it appreciate your joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Vicky is with us in Wilmington North Carolina\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I have a question about an inherited [laughter] um my husband and I are small business owners and we have\nA significant amount of debt with a business and our personnel which is a lot to the business for ... years during the recession and by several years ago and that we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance that we um [noise] my husband had hoped that we can\nUse for the kids' college have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and then another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and a baby face and\nSo this business of making money it's struggling it makes many now that we still have a good bit of debt fan of how much as it might profit um profit uh [noise]\nGosh probably well I have to say probably it doesn't make enough to support us over the past year but um and how long are you going to live in this mythology [laughter]\n\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of his death or we're going to close it and get a job because I don't think you're making any money\n[noise] um am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay our cell tentative his mind was bringing home I'm about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing your you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of the business\nYeah well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars well we can do that we had a lot of how much data God\nI've got about fifty two K. and leap personally had about um Ninety six K okay\nWhere are you in the business doesn't have any that your son personally for it okay so that all is damaged she got on the Internet if you have a hundred dollars in debt and you have a hundred and you have a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we make that's what I mean we are happening\nAll income when you do your taxes is a ...\nIt has banned that we're me like an account to adjust something there that we're taking distribution of a profit and\nThat doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves trying to do business okay years so you need to find out what the profit if you don't know what I mean\nYou get back you give me three different answers so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her does want to hear you got other problems\n[noise] right yeah\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what made\nOkay but it ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the businesses making a profit\nAnd if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts mhm or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you you ought to be all do that but you guys aren't living on a plan to businesses not on a plan on your personal lives on a plant I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got ... in the mail today and what do they start at ... ...\nA good start ... and I'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh but because here's the thing you need to be going no no I'm not going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that when you did fine tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nAnd so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements the the budgets at the business and so we know exactly\nWhere every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income\nAnd then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that\nBetween these two different sets of that\nAnd work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... the debt and throwing a system at your business in the system in ...\nSo I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at\nThe ... just sold it to that and I'll go to the ... and throwing a system\nAt your business in the system and detailed budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away\nAnd the twenty nine thousand as part of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work pulled on him when he gave me a copy of the book entree leadership this list that I ...\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough

this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt\nI Am not I mean it was our way of being honest and I end up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they are into our homes\nCell phone and people look at you look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nYou know it was a little bit of both I mean our family was very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when we got to the store and get it in the beginning but people kept saying oh no just just go by that you know you know you can paid off soon no no no that's not how I Wonder also right\nAnd you know

hundred thousand and four ones and Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home\nA five hundred and twenty\nOkay All right well the income produced off of\nSix hundred and fifty thousand dollars let's just usually that's the uh two fifty and the four hundred you got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easy if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year\nShe doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario does she\nKnow ... camp for service for half a million dollar debt was sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right\nYes okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your death now if she liquidated inputs seven hundred thousand\nThe equity of that buys a two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house and she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then are coming off of a million one\nDoes that make sense so if that's your plan you're okay but if you wanted to stay on that property and continue to live there you don't have enough insurance do you see how I'm doing that\nYes are there okay so what's the goal which one [noise]\nUh\nWould you want her to stay
