for being with us from air 'cause\nIt's just the Dave Ramsey show so glad you're here you know it's interesting [noise] um and informative to all of us to stop and think about something hope\nCauses you to be able to\nMove the needle causes you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the sun was an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis that hopelessness when you think its allies and the tunnel is the way out of your trap then you run to the light\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right and and what's the difference in those two events both light both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe that if you run to the lot you're going to get out\nIt's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset walk\nThe world is coming to an\nEnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort\nHer [laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their hopeless\nWell we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been on and have experiences that she doesn't have right\nSo in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective\nAnd so we you know when you don't have pushed back when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer\nAnd it it's going to grow some things in your future you know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you that there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the young man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with and homeless situations is one of the problem is the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that he wasn't getting it\nIt's like go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because as soon as you knew that money comes from work is where it comes from and I can't get enough hours woven work someplace else work more\nWork all the time but by 'cause I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean out when we were going broke I too little babies and wives houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it worked her mind off and well you know you you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that ... you know ... and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just perspective\nIs like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich and because he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out because it it always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful ... and ... because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these tracks in these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same name a different issue is your perspective and some challenge and some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months in say one of I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's the question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause I don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long would say but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is that is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know the the it's hard to take action\nIt it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you've got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's got to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza\nIt's going to be All right [noise]\nYeah it can be\nYou can choose for it to be All right\nIt's not magic is not positive thinking and it's not easy\nIt's one of the reasons I read biographies of successful people\nIs it lets me know that they went through crap\nAnd it's one of the reason I re biographies of successful people\nAs he lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd it and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it [noise]\nThat that's what I'm you know that's where you are where I have been and am sometimes\nIt's gonna be okay\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nOkay\nEnough that uh our kids learn to your phone number before they learn to ours [laughter]\nOkay well they can call anytime\n[laughter] that's fun I Love\nGoing to say when it had the dream was to get a dog and I was ... things on there and we got a dog

you for taking my call sure what's up I'm okay I just took a new position at a at a new company I'm traveling a hundred and ten miles a day roundtrip commuting okay I'm I'm averaging about four hundred dollars a month and gas\nAnd I'm having a little bit of trouble [noise] kinda stomach moving to this new city because of the fact that it's ... higher up there [noise]\nMy rent right now is only seven hundred dollars a month up there for all and that's on a two bedroom apartment a one bedroom apartment up there started right around thousand dollars\n[laughter] so my question is which I Do about that where your dry or [noise]\nUm I'm driving to carry North Carolina [noise]\nI think you went shopping and one into town and there's another another town Kerry Kerry is not that dramatic it's not thirty percent more expensive than Burlington\nI'm wrong something's wrong with your analysis here\nWell everything that I've done research was I Can't find anything less than non fifty thousand dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment [noise] and I've been digging for almost thirty days now okay ah trying to offset the cost of gas and be closer to my job\nYeah I get him to added on not I'm just not doing what you're doing but um but I I'm not I don't have the emotional ability to commute like that some people do but I Can't do it my commute seven minutes so I Can't relate I'm the I'm\nSure I I just I really think that I mean I\nI have never seen anything that indicates that carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move\nTwenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but I'm the numbers you're giving me just don't work I I just a truth way I think you have it\nLooked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes\nOr whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and dial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall this I carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the one in North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other ants now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue\nYou know one end of North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other end now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about
