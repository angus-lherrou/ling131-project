at the news sources that they that they watch John Brennan is a pothole of a man and he was brought to Obama's Communist Party supporting\nCIA director is an amazing and by the way the real CIA director received one of these packets with white powder earlier this month but the news media doesn't care about that\nDonald Trump too often has helped to incite a some of these feelings of anger is not violent or when he points to acts of violence or also talked about [noise] you know a swinging if somebody uh some of the press the media\nAren't you the guy that um that has accused President

cut\nDeeper okay so like that means that if you were going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not\nOr the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not and it's such a good instead we're doing select soccer um and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or\nHe sold the oldest okay All right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt and the other kids as they come up and do you can do whatever you want to do right with them in terms of ah you know activities\nIn sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the thing that we decided was that all of this is for fun\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play in jail right we we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun\nRight not because we were trying to create a future career for him\nRain and not play we went with the way that there are a couple of different options and when we put Atlanta's less than half the cost of the others yeah\nYou're joining us America loses the day rental\nCar law is with us from Jackson, Mississippi Carl how are you\nDoing very well thank you for taking my call I'm sure what's up [noise]\nWell I think ... is that um there's three in the household and my husband and myself and um my dad passed away two years ago so mom I moved in with us [noise] so um because she couldn't\nMake it on her own so we just kinda combine our income um\nOur monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars I've done the everyday dollar budget and\nWhere like forty seven dollars I'm not over budget as things stand now [noise] um we had back in January we had some identity theft going on in our account and that it is almost\nTwelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the ... that the bank to far overdraft this to so that\nI mean why why did the bank charge you anything if there was a ... a\nAnd B it well it was on and that was charged to our account\nTo know but if it's identity theft or bank shouldn't be charging you anything\nThey did and they said there was nothing they can do about it a lot can change banks yeah we did okay wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card that um if I one of those little Walmart orange you know so we don't even go through the banks anymore mhm\nIt's just a debit card [noise]\nBut um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars and overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm but I'm hearing that and because that was going on a weekend\nAl ... and they wouldn't take them back mhm met down here in that time because that was going on a weekend and own our house payment\nAnd I'm ... thanks for the smaller next that we had well without the smaller nice but we're still have a hand on our house I've got to the housing loan people and they're working with is that we're having to pay extra a month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys fifty nine so I'm fifty nine and a thick the mom Seventy nine okay\nAre you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nThe disability out three of it and none of you were able to work no I Do a little side business witchcraft and things like that what is the nature of your disability um is a hip displacement what's wrong with him\nUm he had um a as a broke his back uh-huh and he has a um\nA piece of the bone enclosed is nerve fact ... and he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he has a defeat it later and he's got like twenty five percent of his heart beating so\nMhm okay um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you've kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel and selling it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times I made like ten thousand dollars\nMhm okay\nAnd that doesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously and involve the keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it it really will be dramatic and held his mom mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven yeah she passes where you don't get a real problem correct\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nUm they were four Seventy eight they've increased it faster\nThan it was that's one of those on your not just due to taxes and insurance going up probably\nDirect uh-huh yeah and what's the home worse [laughter] oh it's worth a shot at a hundred and an honor in July of ... way only twelve five only want to do in this you know I sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do\nA you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help\nNot going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that and I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you a but a man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay that house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou'd feel like you were rich like you were a multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation with somebody on the phone and sell them something\nRight and that that's a possible thing you can do um the you know\nAnd it doesn't cause you to work forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... your struggle it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand if you could\nCome up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get the get the needle to move a little bit here\nMan it would change everything for you I thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\n... how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job\nGood and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes or does it get in on that really hated off about ... ...\nIn your eyes or your parents or any kind of financial perspective is a good time and I think that their kids because she's the wife getting kind of cliche that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one on a kids' faster than sharing a shot of several she won but I'm\nA I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids or if you're broke that stupid okay that was crazy but are you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to be ready to have kids and God says is okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people they need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you went to a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice everybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise yeah really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not that\nIt's not devastating but again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children I mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife and you guys are in good shape your financially smart and you're All right\nWe're in I mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife and you guys are in good shape financially smart you're already moving in the right direction you want to

I just recall a triple eight eight to five five to two Stephanie is starting off this hour Rochester, Minnesota Hi Stephanie how are you\nThere thanks for taking my call sure how can I help well my husband and I and we are currently I'm doing baby step number killed 'em but we also have an eight month old daughter and so we're not quite to that college saving yet\nUh but we do have grandparents that instead of buying him Christmas gifts their birthday presents what like to put away for her college savings and I'm just wondering what's the best way for them to go about that\nUm I Would go ahead and open the child and E S say an educational savings account how much money are they talking about that they want to put in the\nReally decided at but growing up I was getting savings bonds and they don't really want to do that I Would I don't know if they're thinking like a hundred dollars or you know each birthday and H Christmas I'm not sure\nOkay All right well you can open some mutual funds ... two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there's a thousand minimum to get them open okay you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an e as say\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of the account be the custodian that would be you\nOkay and then your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the only limit is you cannot put a total between all of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account\nOK\nCan and a five twenty nine but more than that but\nInto that account so that you\nCan in a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you've just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start the mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money to get it might be just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open the say\nGreat that is a lot of health not just check in with your smart vest or pro when they can help you get that done Lisa is with us in Austin, Texas Hi Lisa how are you\nThank you for joining us America ... is with us from Singapore\nUm the court ball thank you very much and good afternoon how are you doing better than I deserve how can I help [noise]\nYeah so our first of all like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense of chocolate\nYeah so our first of all I'd like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense of started listening to actually have a few dollars truck together great um my question\nIs basically about um I read a voluntary retirement scheme that um as in Singapore so I can put up to thirty five and seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and I would get tax relief on backed\nBy the ... calendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars in taxes mhm now\nI Want to take half my emergency fund and put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just cash blowing it out my salary\nMhm what are the penalties for\nWithdrawing ... shoot I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for what ...\nYeah it's about fifty for a ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the entire\nEmergency fund I currently have thirty thousand a month to keep taking Fifteen thousand input into that I can rebuild my retirement my emergency found in about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that is a cushion\nRight and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about joining the free thousand\nOkay that would be into ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be fifth month\nAll right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not a citizen here\nI'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my now ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my friends in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra well so what happened and that's why I feel and what happens if that at that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm okay\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency there's thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nYou decided what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you you've got your mind the proper miles thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're with\nIt's thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no\nDon't put the money in retirement don't use your emergency\nMoney to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around ...\nAnd don't monkey with it as merchants she found is is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you got to decide your definition that is what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash once and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around\nIf that's it don't mess with that\nBut if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] hey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you\nIt makes me want to really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run the type of fitness but maybe your eyes on the ... model to

and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd I it can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the\nBusiness of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home near coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house\nAnd so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd\nThere's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore that angle\nBecause truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more\nOr doing that then you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more is the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on you before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road\nTo just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did\nYou know we started doing events we started having a class or we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it um because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can fill out an hourly rate open phones a triple eight eight to
