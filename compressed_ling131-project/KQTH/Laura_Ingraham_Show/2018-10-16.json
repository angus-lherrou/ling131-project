Richard you're on the cruise plant show\nI Hi Chris thanks very much for taking my call you back I knew Neil Armstrong I was a graduate student in history at the University of Maryland and I was studying high speed flight research\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy one right after he left NASA I wrote him a letter about a technical question I had and he invited me out to the University of Cincinnati\nAnd to show you what kind of a guy he was he spent the entire morning with me in virtually all one on one tutorial and I was absolutely blown away that a person that his prominence would do this\nNow my Korea took me a bunch of directions I was a curator at the Smithsonian I ran the air force history program I Lived down in Florida but all through that time I'm strong and I had contacted various points\nAnd I got to know him pretty well\nAnd I'll tell you uh the thing that bothers me about this film is it's not hopeful and it's a dollar and that's exactly not the Neil Armstrong I knew all that other people dead you know you ... how he hardly smiles and the film\nNeil Armstrong was a very balanced guy he was a federal going aerospace professionals and those of us who knew him and that's with him in professional Venus\nOh we all was found him completely balance the other thing that doesn't come across ... said he was a highly patriotic individual uh he had flown as a combat aviator for the navy and the Korean War and then had a ... joined the old national advisory committee frail or not it's the predecessor of Nasser in the Nineteen fifties\nBecame a highly regarded research pilot flew the ex Fifteen moved on the end of the space program and I think what what's missed here or in the movie is the sense of optimism\nAnd hopefulness that we had about aerospace and about space flight itself at that time I remember in Nineteen sixty nine\nIn the summer of Nineteen sixty nine I was in a class of Maryland and I opened up a copy of Aviation Week and on the front cover they had a picture of Armstrong alderman Collins the week before they launched on that flight this suddenly hit me we are really going to do this\nAnd you know there was there was just a palpable excitement and that's not captured in this it's as you said it's docket bleakest our\nI think it reflects on fortunately a kind of an anti technology and them is the very animal is that after the Apollo program result in the tank thing of the American space program\nSo that actually we put all our plans\nTo go back to the moon to have a abroad program of space exploration and things like this we put them on hold and we'll allowed rivals to\nCatch up so that the next boots on the moon may well be Chinese they're almost certainly not going to be American you know it's wrong and uh when you look at this you know particularly this this\nAh incredible failure to a by choice not to show the planting of the American flag and the moon the iconic moment in the American space program\nAnd he's not to show the planting of the American flag and the moon the iconic moment in the American space program uh it's just astonishing that the producers would do this\nYeah you know I mean it's like you know the filmmakers their next project is a I was on the battle of ... and at the desire to go to the top of mount ... where they raise a poll\nWell we saw this in the Nineteen nineties on the end of the second World War when the Clinton Administration was involved in that and I got called in wants to a meeting a with a senior advisor to a then vice president Al Gore\nAl

into my bills and she hadn't paid any of my boats or sell goes over a month\nAnd I I guess I just don't know what to do right now okay um and so when did your grandpa commit suicide\nOh about three weeks ago oh my lord I'm Sorry oh what a horrible thing so how old is your grandmother a Seventy\nOkay well what you need to do as soon as you get off the phone is you need to take back control of all your finances would be for the next hour rings twelve you have thirty minutes to get it done okay if you have to shut\nDown the checking account if you have to shut down the credit cards and if you have to freeze your credit that's fine but you need to get control of your finances because your grandmother for whatever reason is misbehaving we've established that correct\nYeah there was never money with your grandpa his money and with your sisters id and for all we know she is open up credit cards and your name as well correct we don't know\nI'm not sure yet\nOkay you need to check your credit and see if she's done that to you as well but you need to shut down a so did you give her your checking account is that what you get rid of take over and how does she handle their money\nOr I gave a checking account my debit card um\nYou just go down to an all rather just go down to the bank enclosure checking account disclose\nAnd whatever monies in their ... use it to be moved over to a different account and have that bank a pill that bank what's going on that this lady is um\n... you know she's she's misbehaving she's mentally ill she says the we don't know what it is but when you do get all control taken away from her aunt is that all she had was your debit card in your checking account all I have so\nAnd that's all she had of your money or your stuff so you get paid as I as a direct deposit into your account\nSo okay so you need to change that as well right to the new account number two a day or today yeah are you going to do it today I Am going to okay good\nAnd then you just call her up and say a journey I got enrolled in a financial clash and so I'm going to take over my finances\nThank you for your help I'll take it from here\nAnd then you need to call like sure your bills are being paid call every one of your bills how much debt of you've got\nAll my bills kowtow that added up a minute ago it's a running around twenty of hungry how many different creditors to you or\nA ... regular builds a hole that's like utility bills and that kinda stuff seriously I don't have any you don't have anything to you don't have any debt no okay now\nOkay then you just need to call your utilities and make sure where they on auto draft on your account\nYes\nThen you've got to give them your new account numbers and get all that switched over to die so that you take over\nYes gay then you're going to\nGive them your new account numbers and get all that switched over to die so that you take over the handling of your money and you can just like random mother know that you know with grandpa was passing I didn't want you to have to fool with this honey San won't take it over I and I'm I'm enrolled in a financial class and I'm going to get control as a twenty five year old man of my life\nAnd I'm ... I'm Sorry she actually in a row now\nShe's in jail why she in jail\nOr my sister cross charges on my own name yes Rudy\nWow okay well you didn't let her know that you took the bank account or a due to all this weird notion of family then\nThey're interesting wow\nSo people in the family are not real happy with grandmother right now I take it\nAnd no not at all yeah very sad\nSad to be Seventy years old and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull a copy of your credit bureau report and you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft\nRoommate sushi had open cards and your name as well OK\nAnd let me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad\nAnd she may or may not meant for your grandmother it'll be picked up\nBut here's the thing the only way if someone opens an account and your name the only way to get that account cleared other than pay it yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who stole your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the iffy as\nIt's my grandmother and I'm I'm surprised that actually that they went and picked her up but they did and uh you know show 'em 'cause it is it is a federal law it is a federal offense now to steal an identity and so um she she's in trouble\n[noise] she's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name right when she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way's fine with me but um\n'cause moments definitely a thief but oh my goodness what a sad thing though one horrible thing you guys are going through not Cody um well much how much do you make what kind of money do you make\nOf forty thousand a year okay are you really ready to take this over and learn how to handle money if you are I'll show you how which in our class

Kelly pick up and we'll get you signed up for financial ... you can go through the classes are gassed\n\nAnd we'll take good care of you in show you how to handle money and then you go handle your money [noise] thanks for calling in to open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five\nHow devastating you're Seventy\nYear old grandmother stealing your stuff I mean I I mean I've run into parents who steal their kids identities and that's pretty much gum but when your grandmother\nDoes it oh my gosh it's just heartbreaking and then a suicide in the family on top of that\nUm but when your grandmother does it oh my gosh it's just heartbreaking and then a suicide in the family on top of that with grandpa oh my gosh what a mess this money stuff man it's it's a big deal not because money's a big deal but it's just so revealing it reveals everything\nElse about she doesn't it [noise] Jesus so do you send your treasures where your heart is it's just a sin money problems you have money

the majority of people who have wealth\nThey started from nothing when I interviewed and they asked them their decision making paradigm they said I make decisions like career decisions or purchase decisions or investment decisions not based on what will make me feel\nGood Friday but what will make me when ten and Twenty years from today if your decision making paradigm by which you analyze\nAnd

town\nAll but it goes to education that's great let's have poor but I got a government plan for you let's put it out there there's this possible way less tax the poor so we can send middle class kids to college for free and say we won ... well that's what my state does\nOr so proud we just took money from poor people in the middle class people kids college for free it's a great program\nWell some some lower class gets go to college but you know who really goes when you to analyze ZIP codes the people that take advantage of the lottery winning the lottery winnings the lottery scholarships are all middle class there's a few lower class but it's almost all lower class ZIP codes that pay for lower social economic ZIP codes that pay for the lottery so why because you're thinking short term\nAnd I say stupid stuff like oh I didn't play for fun I you know what I\n... I Believe a longtime losing money has never been fun to me\nAs lost some money [noise] [laughter] I was a blast and see that's short term thinking if you put the same amount into a\nMutual fund and a
