Linda ... from from your retirement planning and wealth management starts now\n\nIf you're retired or even thinking about retiring and the next several years the biggest risk you face now is retiring in a bear market retiring in a barrel mark it could have a devastating impact on your nest egg and because you're no longer earning a paycheck it could cause you\nTo go broke in retirement you're listening to it's your money I'm Jeff Logan thanks for joining us today and I'm here with my co host linguine she is the way the one and we're a how you doing today and get an ass or how are you good having a good weekend asked them right weekends are great\nWell let's let's start off with a story about the sequel\nHow are you good having a good weekend and great weekends are great\nWell let's let's start off with a story about the sequence of returns and you know what it really boils down to is not using lifetime or long term average is to determine\nHow much you're going to make or how long your income is going to last and retirement it really comes down to what are the sequence of returns going to be now I don't know about you wind up but I have not found that first of all\nI I Wish I did because I did I'd be very ... allow you be written he was you know I might be there at ...\nYes we we we definitely uh I don't have a crystal ball all we have is great hindsight hindsight as they say is twenty twenty the future remains to be seen so let's just give you an example I'm\nJohn and bill are the same age they both have a million dollar save for retirement what just use around number ... you know a lot of people have more than that a lot of people have less out whatever it is it's what they were a lifetime and work hard to achieve so that they can use hopefully that's the case that you use it to supplement Social Security and other income\nTo live on and enjoy their ideal retirement life so that these brothers John and bill are going to retire ten years apart John retires during a bull market\nAnd even though he's withdrawing money from his account interestingly his savings and investments are still growing because the market's growing on the other hand bill retires during a bear market now we've seen a few bear markets recently haven't we [laughter] and they haven't been easy they've been pretty devastating blow something to the tune of fifty percent downturns the last two that we've had\nAnd what's that combination of stock market losses if you retire like Bill did in a bear market and withdraw the same amount of money as his brother was John was withdrawing\nTwo papers retirement bills and so forth it would end up causing him to run through his entire life savings far too soon we'll have a few examples a little bit later I think I Want to hang out with John\nWell you know what I mean the thing is there's a lot of people retire and they get lucky because they retired a good time and they think they're gurus right and some people retire and they think what's wrong with me what's wrong with my advisor what's wrong well the bottom line is they didn't plan\nAnd nobody can really plan for retiring in a bear or a bull market it just kind of ... the markets always right now there are some averages will deal with and again not trying to deal with averages a sequence of returns ruins averages\nBut the bottom line is we don't want you to have a devastating impact on your next day so coming up on today shows we are going to reveal some little known strategies that could protect you no matter what happens next on Wall street and we know\nIt could be anything\nSo let's talk about sequence of returns risk retiring in a bear market um you know we we probably all heard of dollar cost averaging I mean we you know what yeah that's right it's a it's the responsible way to plan for retirement right yes [laughter] and it shapes sickly includes\nUm just the inconsistent um the the volatility in the market does not matter when you are\nRetiring or when you are growing your assets for retirement because if the market's up you put\nA certain amount and the market you buy stocks or whatever the value is when the stock market's down you put mark you put money in the market in stocks and you buy 'em cheaper obviously and so bottom line is over a period of thirty or forty years or however long it is that you've managed to save for retirement you average out\nA certain rate of return which by the way is better in general than the average rate of return over the stock market because you're able to buy low\nAnd a while you're gonna be a little by little ... and buy a but the average is actually are better off the longer you do it consistently now\nWhile you're gonna be able to buy low and ... and buy a but the average is actually are better off the longer you do it consistently now that the opposite of that is when you pull money out during retirement and you are taking advantage of the highest in the market like Bill or who has a ... I\nForgot who retired and the market and John John John was the guy the retired that's when you want to hang out with actual yeah ever [laughter] so John retired and that made money that's right in the in the market and of\nCourse dollar cost averaging really didn't matter or negative dollar cost averaging didn't matter because it was a positive market and so the money kept growing so here's a million dollars while he was using\nThat say four or five thousand dollars a month was still growing net growing and his brother on the other hand had what was called negative dollar cost averaging because as soon as he retired the market was falling he kept on locking losses\nAnd what are you calling out at the same time as well so that's a double whammy isn't it\nAnd protect us money and he just assume that long term average is probably like ... that's right we are also yeah it was like well just hang in there hanging there will hanging in there isn't as\nGood when you're pulling money out and you know there's um there's there's there's a story I I Want to elaborate a little bit more there was a really good article that really pointed a pointed this picture just really I'm painted the picture [noise]\n[noise] yeah ... let me uh let me just to try to capitalize it here in a minute killing her\nArticle a few years ago so here's three brothers they all retired at different times the and this was based on actual sequence of returns people had all their money basically in the market surely it was diversified amongst many different uh a mutual funds and stocks but it was a a basically a standard and poor five hundred index model that was very market correlated\nAnd each of the brothers retired at age sixty five with a million dollars okay which they invested according to you know that market correlated asset allocation model that they were told that their broker said don't worry over the long haul it averages so much that you'll be able to take out\nFive thousand dollars a month on the same date every month for the rest of your life and you'll never run out of money well that was their belief here's the results the oldest brother retired January Nineteen Ninety seven now we were in a bull market riveted dot coms well they ended up being dot bombs with their dot coms from it\nAs if the end of July to six two thousand and sixteen is two years ago\nHe now has withdrawn one point one seven five million dollars in income and his remaining balance is currently about one point six million dollars well that's pretty sweet that's by taking approximately a six percent withdrawal and making slightly less than eight percent average overall the timing was actually worked out pretty good\nNow the oldest brother has approximately two thirds more\nThan is starting a ... that is starting value that's pretty strong\nThese results for approximately um you know a percentage proxy those oracle rate of return for equities and so they they illustrate how if you happen to time it right it it'll work out for you in a long long time now was the oldest brother a market ... who is he just lucky let's that's considered a middle brother\nHe retired three years later in January of two thousand how we remember what happened then right at the Y. two K. scare didn't really blow the mark it up it was the dot bomb the bombed and a bomb very very hard now he didn't make out so well\nAs older brother as a earlier this year and this is a as of last year no no no as actually this is a few months ago this is actually a newer article that I thought so as of this year\nThe middle brother would have run out of money now this is despite the fact that he ... through only nine nine hundred eighty seven thousand dollars not one point when some five million like his brother because he had three extra years of you know income so he drew with considerably less than the older brother he didn't even get a million dollars back and sixteen years why\nBecause of the sequencing is there a chance right he had to bear markets right in the middle and he started his retirement on one that was just quickly cover the last rather youngest brother finally retired in two thousand and three that was at the end of that dot bomb ... bust\nHe had five or six years of recovery time and then the market crashed again but that recovery time didn't do him bad\nHe has withdrawn eight hundred Fifteen thousand so far and still has approximately one point six million dollars left\nSo which brother are you going to be do you know\nWell if the stock market has an average bull market of nine years and we're actually nine years as a march of ... getting close to half time [laughter] I hate to use historical averages here but you know\nAs a march of ... getting close to half time [laughter]\nI hate to use historical averages Airbus yeah you know what are you going to do right now I'm bottom line is is is we really don't know when it's going to come but we do know\nThat or if there's one take away from today show if there is just one thing you need to learn is that you need to rebalance your investments not in sixteen different mutual funds but in investments that don't go down when the market goes down now that may be a bond portfolio if you use it right but I'm a little nervous about bonds\nAre going to get into the different products and and I'm like tapes rather jeeze yeah I Know when does over jumping the bit and um but uh this is something you should put off or thirty or sixty days you know we've got a lot of all ... last couple of months we don't know when the last year was going to drop\nAnd are at this stage of the game it could be too late to recover if this is in fact the time you're planning on retiring so let me show you how you could potentially do more with your investments while reducing risk\nAnd uh we'll make it simple and easy we promised that it won't cost you a dime\nIf you save for retirement and you don't want to lose that hard earned money that you work so hard to accumulate the one of the first ten colors on the show right now at five to seven eight or nine o five nine that's five to seven eight or nine o five nine what you learn in just one meeting could literally save your retirement\nYes the security benefits will be critical in retirement we talk a lot about that in claiming your benefits can be really kind of\nComplicated and have a lot of traps or coming up next normally out how to get every penny al ... or ... ... and I'm just Logan on it's your money [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWhether you're already retired or plenty she retired ... window whether you're familiar return of venting their wealth management will help you maximize your income minimize your taxes ... what you have more a lifetime to achieve now back to hits your money\n[noise] it's\nTime for that and the weak ways to protect your state and prepare for your future and Jeff I'm going to let you take it away [noise]\nRight let's take it away is a ... a protecting your state and preparing for your future you know proper state management really is critical when working toward a more sound unstable financial life I mean that's really the the whole idea about it right from your will to the beneficiaries are two years they plan to your trust\nOr one of the strategies that you need to employ I'm just going to cover a couple of so it might be more like the tips of the week um unfortunately there's a lot of Americans are still having protected themselves or the way they should in fact a there's a study that says only forty percent of adults have a we'll oral living trust in other words they're not they're not taking care of\nTheir stuff for those that they leave behind um they don't have any document in a place at any documentation in place to direct you know where the wishes of or whether stuff just to go so first of all we need to start planning for a long life thanks in part to the medical advances and other things we're living longer today\nMeaning you're probably need to account for a longer lifespan than previous generations how to\nUh without thoughtful strategies outliving your income is a big part of a protecting your state meeting or it's important to generate lifetime income that will cover the standard of living that you want to live\nUm as we age we also have to realize that are expenses may increase with long term care with extra health care costs with inflation and other things did incorporate some financial strategies that will take those things\nSays may increase with long term care with extra health care costs with inflation and other things it incorporates some financial strategies that will take those things into account\nThat of course there's a um obviously the risks of of of nursing care if we look at what those can cost\nA protecting our state from a massive spend down at a cost right now of Seventy of Ninety seven thousand dollars per year in a nursing home the average semi private room cost about eighty five thousand home health aides or forty nine thousand and just on his sister living facility cause just under four thousand a month\nI'm currently so consider the future and consider that those are those plans or a you know protecting said from the devastating costs of long term care pretty important [noise]\nUm a couple of other areas that are need to worry about is to review and update your important documents regularly now one way to avoid probate and avoid uh just hassles with leaving your state and assets to who you want how you want when you want is by leaving beneficiary designations on your assets are on your accounts\nIt's important that regularly you take a chance to review\nThose documents ah everything from life insurance to make sure the beneficiaries are who you want\nSometimes I find people that have come in and they have X spouses that are still on their\nInsurance documents when maybe new spouses and new children might be the more appropriate recipients so make sure that those things are reviewed also if you do not have a beneficiary designation on an asset and your state in Arizona is more than Seventy five thousand dollars it will be most likely subject to probate\nAnd probably is a court process that takes a long time costs a lot of money as a big hassle for the loved ones that you leave behind to mess with that stuff\nSo if you don't have a um a a directive whether a whale which actually does go to probate or a trust or beneficiary designations on things the court that gets to decide what happens to your stuff\nAnd that's not a very pleasant thought either so review your retirement accounts make sure that uh you can from the beneficiary listings are accurate and updated regularly\nOr also make sure you have adequate life insurance with the correct beneficiaries list list that speaking of life insurance you know what is the amount that you need probably for\nA final benefits or a final expenses or something and covered those ah to cover a spouse and things like that are important so have your insurance needs um\nReviewed and covered as well make sure you have transfer on death which is a way to do a beneficiary designation on a bank or a brokerage accounts and um\nRemember that a a beneficiaries name on an asset whether it be a T O D which is transfer on death row appeal the which is called pay on death or ATF which is interest for or just a plain old beneficiary on\nIt's whatever you get you get yeah it's a game that even write whenever you locked in that payment it doesn't go backwards at least not yet they have a medical backwards I Hope they don't know but uh yeah bottom line is at the same or can go up if you're stuck continuing to work\nRight that's true so security benefits either stay the same or go up they don't go down and that offsets a lot of that pressure you're going to have to put on\nTo your your other investments that if you get a a a good professional thorough investment Adel analysis to make sure that you are properly diversified make sure you go ahead and make sure that Social Security analysis is in place because you need to know\nHow much of a gap you need to make up for you or what we call paychecks that mailbox money that comes in every month that's what ... call mailbox many\nIs those checks that come in every month that you can count on is a Social Security maybe you have a pension too but there's probably for like most people and you've saved for retirement you want to use some of those investments and you have a lifestyle that requires that that got be filled with some of that money and you need to put that in a safe place so\nThat way to truly maximize your benefit is to have a sense of security analysis because everybody's situation is different [noise]\nThat's true and a conventional wisdom normally would say just delays claiming Social Security to maximize your benefits\nPut it off as long as you get with that strategy today could wind up costing you tens of thousands of dollars there's a lot more to claim your Social Security benefits than you probably know and your decision could trigger either an avalanche of taxes\nOr the double your Medicare premiums there's a lot of things Social Security do that you're not really maybe aware of that yeah ultimately it costs you tens of thousands of dollars that's really the bottom line maybe even more and depending on how you take it it could put a drain on your other investments the only way you could avoid all this is with a customize Social Security analysis which\nYou might expect to pay hundreds of dollars for it\nBut for a limited time it won't cost you a dime at our office we will\nIt was with a customize Social Security analysis which you might expect to pay hundreds of dollars for it but for a limited time it will cost you a dime at our office we will offer that to our uh this customize analysis if you're one of the first ten colors to call her office and schedule that review and it is five to seven eight nine zero five nine\nThat's five to

could\nCause you to go broke and retirement welcome back I'm Jeff Logan and you're listening to it's your money I'm here with my co host and winning and we are talking about sequence a return risk and how could have a devastating impact on your savings and investments and ultimately whether or not you live that ideal retirement life so\nComing up on our final segment today we are going to reveal some little known strategies that can help protect you no matter what happens next and Wall Street so\nThe first one we talked about already ... while we were off off the air is spending conservative like if you use to spending money that's going to be kinda tough for people\nYeah that's kind of like that or that's the cruelly nobody wants to drink [laughter] you know like I don't like that flavor spending and sort of a little bit you know spending ... if you it doesn't mean necessarily be frugal and not buying anything when it might mean is\nFlying coach and worry about you know for about a third of the ... you know I Would never recommend why allegiance but I Would recommend get the exit row shoot there's leg room back there needs to get a get on the plane or you just don't get free watch by your lunch when you land or bring it with you\nAnd fly legion but I Would recommend gets the exit row shoot there's leg room back there needs to go get a get on the plane early you just don't get free watched by your lunch when you land or bring it with you\nUm you know some of the other thing you know some people love these are real expensive a river brokers it's just what you can still go down the down you about something that costs half as much there are times when you can maybe still have fun not spend quite as much money but if you're\nYou know we have a couple of clients that we have a difficult time with our we have a lot and I'm not saying necessary that that's the catch all but if you have too much at risk and if you are needing to take money out when the market's down\nThen maybe you haven't allocated properly diversified properly if you need to spend conservatively that might be the only choice you have but it's probably because you didn't set aside that\n... though the wish list right and and the thing is is we we have advocated\nMy attitude is I don't want to have any money in the market that I cannot afford to lose\nMore weight on or not spin for your by now if what's that might mean is you create an income plan that actually guarantees more income than you than the bare necessities some people say well this is my I don't have to move under a bridge money maybe it's five or six thousand a month I'll just guarantee\nEnough on my retirement accounts to guarantee that much money and then we'll just live on the rest will you know if you have another five or six thousand you like to spend out of those other accounts\nYou could be like one of the you could be like the middle brother who ended up running on the last year or this earlier this year right sixteen Eighteen years and he might be expecting a thirty retirement he didn't get all this money back\nSo you don't want to be that person either\nAnd uh that just I guess underscores the you know good strategies require good budgets a little bit of forward thinking and if you do want that fund money to be guaranteed them put it in a guaranteed account and plan for it so you don't have to live quite so conservatively frugally or when that comes so what are the things that we do um\nWell I think here and he talked about the bonds\nWell building a bond ladder is is one thing you could do I you know I prefer just because the income of because of the um [noise]\nUh interest rates are rising the bond prices go down if if you don't have bonds coming due every month or every six months if you don't latter them exactly right ...\nYou may have to liquidate a bond at a loss and I'm not sure I like that as much as I liked the idea that insurance companies use like a forty year ladder bond portfolio now bonds come and do every day they can get your money without losses let's take on that interest rate risk annuities are backed by a bomb ladder\nNow everybody sometimes that the word annuity offends people or I hate annuities he should too\nUm that I Love annuities I think they are one of the safest uh vehicles out there for retirement and they're all different types for different purposes so you have to be very clear on what the purpose is for that annuity\nBut the fixed ones are insured secured and guaranteed several levels of guarantee insured secured and their principal protected you cannot lose principal in them like you can in a bond insurance can be takes on that risk for you so\nMuch even even though it's conservative I'm Still making money on on a new and he when the market goes that I participate in that that game when the market goes down I created a new floor zero is my hero and not go below that and then when the market starts to go back up again right I'll start making money again\nAnd we thought we saw someone portfolios break even or lose money last year but we also saw fixed index annuities which are ... are secured by bonds make over ten percent routinely last year with no risk so when's the last time a bond made over ten percent any er well it's been a long\nCure buy bonds make over ten percent routinely last year with no risk so when's the last time a bond made over ten percent any er well it's been a long time since we've seen that kind of interest rate\nAnd uh we haven't seen that kind of a price increase except in a huge\nInterest rate falling market which we had for a short time about eight or ten years ago in the market was crashing we add interest rates coming down pretty hard\nBut I think those days are over and I think we need to rethink or yeah how how secure that a bond ladder is now now hey now don't get me wrong I Love bon letters and I've loved them for Thirty years I just think there are changing a little out of favor now that we're going into what\nMany experts including Jeff Dunn lacking Bill Gross people that know about bonds billionaires made by bonds\nUm they say we're going into a bond there market I don't think we want to be in the ...\nAnd you can continue to do what you've been doing you could be very surprised by the results\nRight you know I I also I I think that um you know ... you\nPrivate asset managers like the ones we use implements rather than prioritize acting investment for large losses in markets and then hope to take advantage of upside when markets were better place to do so\nThey made it is edging techniques using options are really going to cash when the risks\nOutweigh the potential is part of the winning by not losing strategy we are near like do you feel it gives our kinds of better chance not outlived their money and enjoy a more reasonable and\nIf you would like more information on planning your financial future concept for retirement planning

retirement your host Nathan brighter ego\nWelcome to worry free financial solution [noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nVolatility is back in a big way as markets continue to get tossed around as more economic\nKeep pouring in and financial reports from various major companies are digested by analysts\nWhile key economic indicators are still showing signs of life in the economy along with a roaring job market and low unemployment the fact remains that interest rates are starting to creep up in a big way and are feared by some to put the brakes on this red hot economy\nHome sales in fact are slipping in some areas with prices falling as mortgage rates have increased giving pause to would be home buyers\nAnd then some companies are reporting that Harris costs are starting to hurt their bottom line\nMeanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to dig it heals into the ground on rates saying quote we no longer need to be stimulating the economy unquote it is their job after all to keep inflation at bay\nThis has some on Wall street a little bit concerned as the long term effect of higher interest rates and the potential economic slowdown are still unknown\nAnd when there's a little uncertainty out there Wall Street starts to move in a big way now what does that mean for your money and your retirement\nWell definitely it means more uncertainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plant\nAnd certainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nRetirement planning requires a careful thought process that involved many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some of the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again now you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows\nBut the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result so what do we think the right thing to do is well it's definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market\nSo our retirement planning process at Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street\nWe've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place to keep our money growing there are much safer alternatives out there and even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could\nBe an IRA or raw firing a roll over IRA and inherited IRA or a four\nO. one K. or even just regular saving money\nAnd in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial an estate protection services we feel that what we do is so important\nWe help our clients right here in southern Arizona take some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio we do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customize plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall street risk\nSo if

owned business that's been here in Tucson for over twenty five years\nSo bottom line\nYou don't want to end up like the falcons they put the game on the line with that play and lost now your retirement your life it's much more important than just a game [noise]\nLast now your retirement your life it's much more important than just a game so don't put your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market\nThere's so many risks from all sorts of different avenues especially right now there are so many economic or is out there and talk of a slowdown we're seeing action on tariffs and trade wars and rising interest rates\nEven major investment from some of them are telling their clients to get out of the market and that we are quote in the last hurrah of the market I don't care what you think about what's going on in the White House or how the media is portraying everything when it comes down to it\nThe economy and Wall Street are going to do what it does on its own\nEconomies are cyclical it's always been that way and it always will and the fact is right now we're seeing signs that were near or already at the top\nAlan Greenspan put it best when during the dot com bubble of the nineties he said he saw quote irrational exuberance\nNow maybe it hasn't reached that far maybe it has you'll be the judge so even if you have a Wall Street portfolio now but you feel like you're safe with your bond funds\nDon't fall into the false sense of security that you think you might have innate bond fund now I spent ten years as a Wall Street advisor and many advisors they don't talk about this but a bond fund or bond mutual fund or ATF\nThey all have the potential to lose principle value you may think that they are safe because they tend to bond but unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street\nAnd it trades and it moves it has a price and it's highly sensitive to interest rates so if rates are on the rise those bond fund values will go down and depending on how fast rates move\nYour principal value in that bond fund could decrease substantially faster than your funding yield in the last Twenty years or so we've been in a downward trending interest rate environment\nTo where they almost went to zero in two thousand nine\nNow rates are on the rise and we have yet to ever experience in the history of Wall Street what kind of an effect long term rising rate have on bond funds so what do you do\nHere at Mayfield financial an estate protection services\nFor over twenty five years right here in Tucson we have been a safe money retirement advisor our

importantly is guaranteed never to lose value no matter what happens on Wall street or even with the Federal Reserve are safe money plans can be regular savings money they can be IRAs and if you're

Nathan Federico a safe money retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives the first\nIs the wealth building an earnings space this is a time when we are working trying to save\nAnd it's a time when we contribute to things like for one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet and should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building to wealth spending the second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money\nThe second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. where our IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets\nInto income and in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you're a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan\nAnd it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one pensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now\nMost of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement\nEspecially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives this is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four O. one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one k.'s and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees\nThis is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement here and Mayfield financial and its\nCan provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial an estate protection services this is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four O. one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plans do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four O. one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course Ross IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive all with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no conditions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get more information on how a safe money plan could help protect your hard earned money and your four one K. and your savings and your IRAs all\nYou need to do is requests are safe money book\nThis one hundred and Thirteen page book provides you with any easy to read guide with information that you're going to

N. dot com to find out what about more rip about re a and his book um and it reads and the whole\nMountain burn reveals in stunning ruthless detailed the horrors of war the courage of soldiers and the fact\nThat no matter how many enemies we bank vanquish there's always just another over the next ridge um I you know re you touched on that I I guess maybe\nThe point of this book is that war is can be random war\nCan be ugly um you know sometimes it might be a child or it might be a vote 'em and of course you know you're losing buddies at the same time\n[noise] yeah yeah absolutely I think there's um you know in spite of our best intentions um there was always an ugly ugly side effects\nI'm with a with warfare and with you know infantry combat and in particular [noise] um so I I don't think that windows things happened it doesn't make an American soldier of bill and um but uh it's just it's just the reality of of what what happens I'm In an a on a battlefield\nWhat again I don't want to give way too much of the story line because we want people to read the book but in essence you're following\nOr you're introducing us to the two main characters sergeant Nick birds and private Danny Shane a bird's grizzled veteran or perhaps too much time in the trenches and uh you know Danny on on the other side is coming in fresh literally his his uh his ... weighs more than he does probably\nAnd uh we kinda we get to watch their relationship developed and and Danny become a veteran himself\nYou're an officer ray but I have to ask these characters are they based on anyone you knew or they sort of a compilation of some of the soldiers you served with\nI think I think they're compilation of ... of real people on there that they are um [noise] you know they're in some cases I combined maybe in my head um elements or or character traits um that I saw from from\nUh from different from different people but you know I think I'm the origin of all this was was in reality and real people are for sure um the your you know\nTypically would purchase character you know I think there's there's a lot of\nChurches in the army and\nYou know the the NCO the the sergeant that's been on multiple deployments you know who has lived in or you know centers in effect two thousand on 'em and there's there's a lot a lot of men and women in the in the military uh that that uh had had been repeatedly the pool\nOn um and there's there's a lotta lotta men and women in the in the military uh that that uh have had been repeatedly deployed to end it it does take a a a really dramatic I think it has a dramatic effect on people's personalities\nWhen I tell you that that really comes through in this book and I I don't want to discourage people from reading it because it is you you got a good\nI'm a good descriptive voice re I one thing I enjoyed is is um you know the way your words actually put me in that place if folks go to your website a rape McFadden dot com you've got some photos up there\nAnd the Hindu Kush this is\n... it is rough country it sort of reminds me of of the area here on Tucson where we broadcast from where I mean you go from two thousand feet in the valley and in the mountains shoot up over nine thousand feet I mean they you know sky islands we call them they just rise up off the desert floor looks like a little bit rough weather in Afghanistan but\n... I encourage folks to go to your website and look at these pictures because that will give them a much better sense of\nWhat you and your fellow rangers had to deal with their let me ask you just sort of a practical question you touched on the fact of the difference in combat between Iraq and Afghanistan\nThere's a photo on your website of um it's a family show so let me say I do I put this you are communicating with hand signals I'm across the valley to your enemy is there a key element in in your book is is the use of artillery but was that\nFor your your hand held weapons was that something you could actually engage across that distance or or\nUm we struggle with with distances and they were you know mainly machine gun\nFights and you know the the the Taliban al ... elements that the various\nMilitia groups in those areas they were really really good at engaging has had the sheen gun distances and that you know essentially\nUm escaping I'm into into debt space on the backside of a rich uh so we often struggled to engage them with small arms and artillery andme orders were our primary method I think where we actually had\nYou know killed and wounded a lot of the enemy um so we got really good with with our motors in particular because those were we control does\nRight there in in in the valley and uh um they were very responsive were directly on the radio to them as opposed to you know one time five power there's that tended to be stationed further away and they just are are it's they're slower to get in the fight so mortars or the week a lot of people would motors\nOkay and then do did you have to and literally I mean folks you're you're on one side of a mountain you'd have to go all the way down in the valley back up again probably to see if your your fire actually hit any enemy how common was it that that was part of your mission\nThat has carried on through through your new novel that's coming out um tell me a little bit about the the challenge you know back in that I use the quotation fingers the olden days when you know both sides wore uniforms and it was very clear who was a good guy and who was a bad guy and who was a civilian\nThat I had to guess was always a challenge for you there in Afghanistan I mean not to mention people switching sides\nYeah absolutely um very tangled up and environment with the population so for example we had a fighter you know a a mid level enemy commander that we were after you know and his little little sort of brother right who was you know maybe ten used to\nLike chase us around and like sells Pepsi you know so\nUm it's it's a really tricky environment there you know the tribes themselves we got you know we're out their everyday living among them um ... you you really get to know people in and Afghanistan in particular\nUm and so things become very personal or were you know you sort of you to the same bad guys on the radio every day\nYou know you meet their part you know members of the family um so it's it's much more personal and Afghanistan in those remote mountainous areas were in Iraq you're you know you're sort of in the big cities in the cities anyway there's sort of a a faceless nature to to a lot of what's\nGoing on so so really the the characters in your book the Egyptian and said boy were those based on actual interactions and loosely based on your mission while you were there in in Afghanistan in the Hindu Kush\n... yeah certainly and again I think our our two characters that a lot of uh servicemen and women could could\n... yeah certainly and again I think our our two characters that a lot of of servicemen and women could could easily identify with it you know that the kid that sort of is is um [noise] you know starts off\nChasing around the American patrols you know trying to sell cookies and Pepsi and cigarettes to ah to the Americans [noise]\nAnd then you know that eventually I think rose into you know a teenager and and gets caught up in the war um and you know the Egyptian yeah mhm a lot of uh you know\nPeople like I I think you know but essentially an al ... figure you know a very elusive al ... figure and based on um experiences I had um overseas\nRight we've got about three minutes before the next break there's something I Want to bring up and and try and stick with me here because I've I've got\nA point to my conversation and you'll get it here in a second the other thing you and I have two things in common one is we both have public administration degrees\nAnd apparently we both have a fascination in a like a for emeralds like I said stick with me I'm going to [laughter] go back to two of your pieces feature storylines involving gemstones and the whole mountain burn\nAnd then you also another published short piece called the green gift that appeared in as you were military\nI I have to ask honestly rate is an Afghan mountainside after an artillery attack a good place to to scrub around and look for Rubio has an emerald so I mean I just fascinated me\nYeah I'm Glad it cut your your interests one there were a lot of minds um\n... are not necessarily emerald mines that precious gems lines in the areas where I'm where I fought in Afghanistan and so\nUm I never you know found a gemstone on the ground myself but the ... the kids would I think loot\nThe mind tailings right and then they would bring what they found in the tailings down and try to sell it to us um and that was you know sort of um you know that was the reality from which some of them you know the fiction was base\nOkay so now none of your soldiers are you walk through an area looking for a battle damage assessment and and look down the shattered Boulder and said oh look what's that sparkly little down there [laughter]\nAh we never got that lucky okay ever got that lucky but there are you know those those those mountains where we thought were you there were mines everywhere and and precious jet deposits of precious gems I'm Around us but uh I was never so fortunate\nOkay and and on the public administration side let me sort of plant the seed we can pick this this theme up after the break but one thing that I ... and again if you look at the photos\nAbsolutely gorgeous area and I think in your book someone mentioned hey you know I'm gonna come back and build a ski resort here\nGenerally folks no matter where they are in the world want to be left alone they want to raise and feed their family um and and you know be able to seek out prosperity that area they're putting on my public administration my economic development ... would have a lot of potential I think\nBut for people shooting at you\nAll the time um you know or is this something we're I'm I'm thinking too much in the terms of of of an American versus the local culture there\n[noise] they um yeah there there is no shortage of scenic beauty and those mountains and I think there's there's low key\nUm yeah there there is no shortage of scenic beauty and those mountains and I think there's there's locations in that general part of the world that that there is a tourism industry um although I Would say you know a lease on the Afghan side of the border\nIt's hard to imagine any tourism occurring there just because of um you know violence and war are are so deeply entrenched in those areas or the the tribes are in many cases are\nIt seems they like to just fight for fun or each other outsiders 'em and anybody who's who's not from the immediate clan\nSo I don't I don't imagine going myself going back and skiing bear a nowhere else doing it uh in in the immediate you know a couple of decades\nBut I tell you the way I did my research or they export about fifty million dollars annually and pans your emeralds I'm I'm I guess the the optician me wants to hope that maybe we could\nGet more folks mining and showing emeralds than than growing opium but we'll talk a little bit more about the folks who is your house ...
