I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot of policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo that whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ... but you're not paying for today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband\nAnd I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say dad I'm I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to pay that kind of thing you know and it can but you have like I said\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan a plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today [noise] better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I'm a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings said come a thing called a ... from my company and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total at ... or\n... or ...\nWell it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be ... percent of my total and had you know and\nAnd my question is whether the pay gap as a lump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you'd die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die a\nThat money's gone 'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you get that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but ... a\n... is still love you die then yeah you gotta survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept to block so the ... the bottom line is it's got a decent ... low\nYou got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to Iowa race and invest them and good roast our mutual fund so it sounds like you're networks in excess of a million\nA yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total network to assets house yes hopefully\nNo ... well ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire one for that but ... before that happened\nA\nMillionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were Ella typically young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nAre holding pattern is because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means live they bought a modest lifestyle which ah we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things I think if you can limit\nStupid thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that [laughter] they\nMake 'cause every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid\nThings begin you can minimize those new things along the way\nIn a way of a modest lifestyle with below you mean I'm no void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize those stupid yeah\nMaybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple math on that works to your benefit a at a wall of live if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead [noise]\nThe question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there it's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire\nI Love this millionaire subject is so when\nYou're going to be hearing more from rooms useless\nIt's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire\nI Love this millionaire

right yeah not just grab one of the smart Mr pros off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um\nYeah no I just grab one of the smart Mr pros off our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um have your mom sit down to even if she's are just so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a little income doesn't have to generate a lot she's only a couple of hundred bucks shorter month\nMhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay\nSo what we're saying is is that you know that there's this house is really poorly managed\nDon't hardly anything [noise]\nYeah it it comes and goes there's been a couple of

the fan and thank you for having me on your show\nCertainly thank you how can I help\n[noise] okay [noise] so I've been following your plan for like a couple of months now I had the emergency finally that I'm working I'm baby step too good on that night and I had made progress not a ton of which I'm\nOn my issue is idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I I'm not letting it take over my life is good and my question is is how do I I check 'em for my deductible\n... recently I recently switched off clan cement basketball started again and also the chronic illness you're going to hit the ...\nRight um\nIt ... the guy that thing on the go it it it's not that ... and it's not life threatening are you going to do it every year\nYeah\nOkay so now also they look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is that I couldn't hear pain condition and that the doctors are unsure of where it comes on okay um\nSo if it was over there but I Do is I'm sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah well what I Would\nDo is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand or the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA\nA whatever a line in your budget\nFor medical expands ongoing chronic medical and just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAt least a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something not yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching I don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really likely here right now\nOn what I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we in Germany\nOn what I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we ... we got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem we're\nGoing to identify ended that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI made I don't think a lot

anywhere from Thirteen hundred at sixteen hundred ... a paycheck and\nI knew you had a price on Montana you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with a\nGuy gets them I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy five or rent it give us a lot um and I do that somehow from ...\nTo them and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nPratt is everything credit card I also because they can hear it I was trying to ... stick thing mhm I'm not at all and then it's you know most of it is right and so got kicked out of it so I have like a total of six figure out\nOK show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food\nPantry not eating\nNot eating outside and you're paying more than half your life from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation\nSo food shelter clothing and transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities are only the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you were just fell out into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming you're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah\nI mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... said I've got ... how do I prepare for it you save in coverage so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you know began to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up\nBut ah we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you've got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is Tom for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you [laughter] I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step the right now I'm In fact we just paid off our second credit card today though we are done like credit card and moved on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working the base that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nI don't know if we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... of all I Want to get your input on it we have our ten percent by it\nBut we want to live without a fake\nI'm kind of a ... law and get your input on it\nWe have our ten percent by it but we want to live without thinking about what you got up and giving back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to\n'em or their charitable organization that we believe in that are arguing day or a ... you know when the crisis mission is that we're trying to looking at trial give what we can to people who need it\nUm but then she don't love and wanting to strike and present a church and then you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give it to church and\nWe had a big argument about either yesterday I was\nOut on you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is tent it literally means chant the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twenty if it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to ... they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker a plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do\nIn his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you [noise] I Love you and um you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout the old\nTestament and Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is a time of the tens of your income evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years at that time is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer your wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical history not your wife argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that rather [laughter]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nSo one Osama includes cars yes it is because the cars fifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty year\nWhere did you use to the old drum\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why now I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate [laughter] I've got to choose\nA house is sold takes listings and expanding clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand\nBy the end of the year and that was what does your why didn't make of the one who\nMakes fifty a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use\nTo make yes okay good good news right\nGuess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and everything if she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money\nBetween that long span 'em and everything if she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [noise]\nOkay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for poor and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows said\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need it my my truck it for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these ... of course we'll have\nIf I Can't get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good uh what is called ... and that's what I was trying to tell her to as I'll get a car cash and then she tells her car and they have at least one car right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're gonna move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay off in other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are any or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do St\nLouis to three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today\nI Would sell your trial today and I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth about making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollar for the bet a year for two years we can keep her car\nBut if you're not willing to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then\nYou're not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her\nToys you have a marriage problem [noise]\nOkay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit you run around started selling mama's car is not what a good way to get mom on board\nHalo so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nWith that and then you might be looking at a different career and she's going to be looking at us on our car through and you get her car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this mess cleaned up\nAnd then you might be looking at it for a career and she's going to be looking at us on our car drew and you get hurricane car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this mess going into\nThis is the day Ramsey chef [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do
