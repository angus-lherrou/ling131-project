I'm\nAn experience doesn't have a score now I'm ... I don't think either one of these have a separate scoring rather than fight though I don't I'm I'm not aware experience ... doesn't show anything except psycho score on it now maybe they have a program and I'm just not aware of it where there started their own score um or\nMaybe Equifax as Rebecca ... says I don't care and nobody cares what I ... a more [noise]\nBut um\nExcept their former president who made like a hundred and eighty billion dollars for quitting uh but\nUh no I\nWouldn't worry about it I wouldn't worry about any of these scores by the way because they're all based on you borrowing money\nAnd so again\nIt's a set of false logic it's it's bad critical thinking 'cause the only way you get a high cycle scores to borrow money and why do you get a high score so you can borrow money this whole thing is about playing his he faced with a bang somewhere\nWorshipping at the altar of a false God called fight go psycho is not your provider only think psycho will provide you with us the ability to borrow money\nWhich provides you with debt which takes your income which takes your ability to win with money away it's gone by\nClean on his own Facebook I Know life insurance is less expensive the younger I Am if I'm thirty two what is the best age to purchase term insurance what exactly does that cover death uh I still have school that\nThat doesn't matter\nOr you don't need life insurance unless someone is dependent upon your income for their\nAbility to eat\nSo ... ... ... if you are a mom\nThe income that you are making you should get term life insurance today and it doesn't matter whether you're thirty to forty two or twenty two if you're a mom and you're earning an income and your kids are counting on your income then you would need about ten to twelve times your income on you and yeah it's a life insurance coverage death\nAnd statistically the older you are the more likely you are to\nDie so it gets more expensive it's a pretty simple math formula and so yeah\nTwenty thirty two is more than twenty two in less than forty two years old uh the the premiums are less so but it's not that expensive to get Fifteen to twenty year level term insurance ten to twelve times your income on you\nAnd that is not a baby step that's a start right now go get it now and just check out Zander insurance dot com they'll give you a quick and easy

before you get mad as\nIt did I got you got to what made the difference the causes which ...\nI think coming up that it was close to ten years that I was getting closer to when I've been doing this calendar shame drew a little bit I ...\nAt first I was a tortoise for a long time I was just going as it as a teacher didn't make a whole lot of money and I started teaching and then you know two thousand nine and she does that mean if you were\nTwenty six and you were fun yeah and I was doing some stuff and then I was using that credit card that I kept for emergency oh emergencies and I\nHave a lot of the classes were kind of dead so I needed but I took it again and now I teach it because I mean that really are no no you know do I know it's\nSort of monsters you got the information you didn't apply it all before but then just the the fact that it's just not getting anywhere no traction in the decades coming up and the that got you fired up again is that Rogers other audience\nIs and

doing well thank you for taking my call they sure what's up [noise] well\nI have a question for you I'm I'm now considered unanswerable and my term life insurance will expire next year I'm In our FDU costs there are several of us that are considered uninsured people so are one of my questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case\nI already have accidental deaths insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three\nWhy are you not ... history of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got that diagnosis removed but I have that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can Roger\n[noise] we're in the process of having them do like a [noise] a double check\nNot dry out or something because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more trouble in your situation so that's great news just hopefully as a short lived issue okay because in other words I think I think you can\nSure and so I just don't know exactly when or what it's going to cost that's the other thing you've gotta look at you or I could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough diagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer to your question overall is if someone's uninsured people yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nThere would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kinda gimmick insurance is what it is\nA definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those sometimes they do ah sometimes it's very very expensive uh but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it may just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so what did you have like a ten or twenty year term it's run out\nTrust when property management professional realtor and homeowners needed someone they can trust they call Silverado plumbing were most farmers have at least ten years'

Chelsea how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary my my husband is transitioning it tricky position I'm aware they're going to be giving him a pay raise but with that the rave there I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week\nSo I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him in a former I forget that when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend to calculate whether\nThat the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours she was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nOr somebody will be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary but that's the kind that we don't know yet\nConservative shower really read it at the salaries fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work its effect of Leah ...\nRight\nYes that that makes sense it's like yeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it was just more if it were in the ... member to\nUm I I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nRare but the question the question is not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up and the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be living to management because it shows\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWhile we be dancing wouldn't we yeah okay yeah 'cause that's what that's like getting paid a lot more\nAnd I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like ... it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on you see what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did in my favor and it's been and he gets paid forty\nBut he's working the same number of hours or he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah just making sense to you\nThe you know\nYes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's the salary because that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently Chris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good they taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] uh well right now I'm a I'm a income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt\nA battle eleven thousand a student loan debt that uh that that about six months ago was about Nineteen thousand and I've been working working hard and save money and paying it off as much as I can good uh cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention ...\nAnd I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could\nYou know be my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so I'm kind of want a young lady of financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining dead I have and yeah my aspirations because I'm In the process and I've been saving to ah get heavy a home loan now is just about their so any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciative\nRight well I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now because we don't need to make a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne of 'em twenty thousand dollars a day so the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes sir it's a a odor the odor either slash a mold a little small machine that um people getting on their home\nOkay and you've made one\nI made a very um rudimentary proud of the tight mhm the next the next phase I've got is like either be at the end of my rainy day fund started coming into my regular cash flow and like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling\nAnd get me out a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level of what I Want to do so again Dr\nJump off my my debt plan more do I have his mind Vinton [laughter] okay um\nWell what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know what you would do is you would build a couple of 'em and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\n... because you don't go into production on prototypes that our own tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell them\nYou know kind of shy away from that I'd like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in the in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give you just let's just make up a pretend example okay he wouldn't be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the ...\nOdds and you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the deal works then and what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of 'em or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order they just place a deposit with you large enough to build the order\n... and it finds itself\nThat's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\nWhat they think I should dial down my rather than just spend all my extra capital towards paying out my credit card debt my student loan debt\nI don't think you have time in much capital on that you've already we're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right [noise]\nWell I keep it in that but I I just see I'm a protecting if I Want it to be you know a good good looking kind of\n... it's a prominent ... there are no protections [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken [laughter] want to\nGet it perfect you're going to put it out there in the end the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes informing function changes in the switch has to be on that side in this which has to be made out of this has to that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get\nTwo of them in somebody's restaurant in there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ... and then they give you enough money [noise]\nAnd they're a deposit for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing\nAnd basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except your brain power and you're sweating and your smile out there selling it and that's how a lot of these things get off the ground a way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production
