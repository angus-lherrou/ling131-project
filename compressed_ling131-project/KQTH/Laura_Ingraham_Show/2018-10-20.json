director of resolutions love solutions for women here at retirement evolution Donna Karan it's great to be here with you again oh my gosh what happened on Wall street last week\nWill naturally market volatility is on our mind obviously the markets moved around a little bit last week we could say and not in the direction that most of us like\nAnd so there's a lot of questions is what does it mean for our listeners what does it mean to your investments and and if your retirement to the near future\nWhat does that mean for you or not necessarily that that drop was incredibly dramatic but it was certainly there but what if we had to drop that was big or what do we need to look at what our listeners me to pay attention to and I guess one of the things that we look at whenever we see markets like that and if people are getting very nervous are concerned about that\nTo pay attention to and I guess one of the things that we look at whenever we see markets like that and if people are getting very nervous are concerned about that than they probably need to take a closer look at their portfolios and do an evaluation\nOf really how much risk taking inside their portfolios and I think that's a lot of things that sometimes is looked at when people look at their portfolios are not looked at as closely let's not say that it's not looked at but to have a true understanding of what ones risks are in their portfolio\nI think is critical in a lot of people tend to see a larger drops when they don't realize the actual\nAmount of risk that they're taking inside their portfolio I Would sure but a lot of the folks that we work with in particular are phone's been ringing off the hook as the markets we're going down because we've structured their assets in such a way their investments in their entire retirement picture if such a way that we're able to kind of glide through these areas down terms\nBut if you're having that worry if you're having that concern you know as our listeners you should sit down with someone if it's not a sit down with somebody else\nAnd really get a good picture what your risk\nIs what you're willing to risk and also get an understanding of how much risk truly is in your portfolio not just the naming conventions of your portfolio which means you know my advisor says I've been a moderate portfolio or conservative\nWhat does that really mean by the numbers and if you're advisor or if you can't do it on your own find somebody who can who can truly show you what kind of risks there are\nBut we all have to understand that the markets are going to make some changes there's going to be some ups and downs and we need to pay attention to that and I don't care and has something she might want to end as well\nWell I Do I I think the other big question this week has been that fabulous\nAnnouncement from Social Security about the two point eight percent cost of living adjustment that our Social Security beneficiaries are going to be receiving in two thousand Nineteen\nBut then of course also just announced is that the Medicare part B premium will be increasing from a hundred and thirty four dollars where it's been in two thousand Eighteen\nUp to one thirty five fifty for two thousand Nineteen and the part B deductible is increasing\nFrom a hundred and eighty three dollars in two thousand Eighteen hundred and eighty five dollars in two thousand Nineteen so I think those are some important numbers I certainly gotten much questions over the last month or so about when those numbers would be coming out\nYeah I was doing some quick math in my head and actually the Social Security increase is higher than the costs of Medicare so we got a a maybe a little percentage or percentage and a half\nActual increase or Social Security\nIncreases later on in the show what we're going to hear something you don't want to miss out on his one of my colleagues sat down with financial educator in New York Times best selling author David Bach and to also talk about the markets and how it impacts you\nWere actually going to squeeze that interview in on the show today it's something you're not going to want to miss out on and it's coming up a little bit later in our program yes so low way and why don't you take this away from\nMy right I Will take it away I Am excited about that at every because I Want to hear what he has to say about this recent volatility in the market but I I Want to take you back to the Nineteen eighties ... remember that three D puzzle the ruby life\nTotally yeah I mean you can like literally man [laughter]\nAre you good at it\nOh no no that wasn't a great up to ... keep John however was a phenomenal worry about ... ... I like\nPuzzles some thing that I had to solve it yes I worked at that you've\nIt done okay well we all know that yeah just as soon as you're about ready to one side one move and messed up the whole thing and it honestly it's kind of like plenty out of retirement strategy an income strategy you've got to align the various pieces of your retirement portfolio puzzle for maximum you can and\nIncome strategy you've got to align the various pieces of your retirement portfolio puzzle\nFor maximum come and it can seem a bit daunting so today that are going to focus on along with market volatility or going to focus on solving a couple of size of your retirement puzzle John and Karen I Know you spend a lot of time every single day helping others solve this retirement puzzle so I\nKnow you help them with their withdraws from their pensions and therefore when case and the IRA all to their best advantage come retirement right\nWhat you are right they're making all the pieces of the retirement income puzzle fit together can be tricky\nGiven factors like taxes and the fact that so few people nowadays actually we have a punch in the fall back on when retirement arrives\nInflation is low currently in health costs are increasing there are a lot of pieces to consider and just like a jigsaw puzzle or the Rubik's Cube ... we were just talking about it can feel overwhelming when you begin but today I Want to relieve some of the confusion frustration and of course tribulations of beginning to solve this puzzle\nDrop on Wall street so if you're like most investors nearing retirement and you may be wondering how this will impact you\nMy colleague making most I had\nA chance to sit down with financial educator in New York Times best selling author David Baake for an insightful conversation about what this volatility means for you in retirement and we have a opportunity to listen in on this what we're going to do was over the next ten to twelve minutes we're going to listen to that interview with David by\nIf you have any questions about what you hear that you can call John and Karen right now during our show that number to call is five to zero three nine nine six three for one five twenty three Ninety nine sixty three forty one\nOctober tenth saw the worst day for the down since February a big drop in popular tech stocks put an impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement\nDavid by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street and David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah David been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades\nHe's nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finished rich and smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of Eighteen wealth management one of America's\nFastest growing our eye gaze David wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today Thanks for having me on the show so let's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and so the question becomes all is there anything specific that's going on and I'll give you a sample the first thing is that rates are going up and you even heard the president talked about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates\nThe fed the actually been raising rates really two thousand\nBut most recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can lend it called the Federal Reserve fund ... record happens temper\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes right so you're going to borrow money for a whole if you're going to refinance or if you're going to buy a car and you're gonna financed that car\nOr you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where's your borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up and\nThat's from the market right because if you're well maybe people will buy less home they'll refinance or home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop is what it costs more to borrow money\nThe markets can spoof that consumers will slow down on there's been so that's the first thing it's really been a story about\nThe fed and rates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years\nAnd those historic lower rates the fed put in place after our great recession we're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective\nDavid I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can still trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement\nWe'll pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan and you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if you're doing one retirement than the good news about race going higher is that\nThe rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries\nAre going to hire the most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces so the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe ten year treasuries could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look out and go wow you know what that is pretty good I can live off of those income checks and so I think it is for retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David not well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of the market correction\nSo I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter]\nRight it's funny because here's nobody knows right what I Know and and we've been talking about this and maybe you know I've done other interviews on this I Know we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hadn't even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had and\nAt the same standpoint the last day two months I've been telling people don't get greedy [laughter] right like don't now is not the time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money\nBecause if you're in your fifties in the markets pullback you can't afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you're retired or your comfort level was seeing your money drops significantly is going to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you're approaching retirement are already retired that you talked with a financial adviser that you work with a financial adviser that if you have a financial was right now that you pick up the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do call your financial advisor go back into their office\nSit down with them have them walk you through what you're invested in a lot of people who are retired that might be fearful the stock market today\nActually have a very well we call very low exposure to the stock market like army people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and half of their money isn't an annuity paying them a guaranteed rate and half of their money in bonds and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so but they read the news and they're very fearful so don't\nBe fearful find out find out how much money do you actually have in the market\nHow much risk are you taking and again work with your financial advisor I just a big believer that\nA working with a professional for Jewish area which is what we recommend people work with a registry investment advisor when you work with a financial wise or the the most important part is that they do a financial plans for you that they get to understand what your comfort level with risk is\nAnd then they help you build an investment portfolio based on your goals and your comfort level with risk if you have a very low comfort level would it take any risk well then you should have less money in the market but the key right now to notice when markets are pulling back the most important you can do can link is just call your visor don't panic\nSits still don't do anything every market pullback ultimately has had I Can't promise it will always out but I can tell you is always had a recovery right\nEvery market pullback ultimately has had I Can't promise it will always out but I can tell you it's always had a recovery right every single major market pull back\n... is that a recovery so I'm just a big long term believer that you want a diversified portfolio high quality investment built up a financial plan working with a financial ours you can trust that they're old your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky part\nDavid fantastic insight on this market drop what the silver lining here and all of this\nWell I think the silver lining is how incredible and economy we have right now like let's not lose sight of that look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment in America in forty nine years\nUnemployment is at three point seven percent right now why is that because we have an incredibly strong economy right now so GDP which two years ago nobody believed that you could get three well most people certainly GDP right now\nThe first half of the year three point ... percent there are projects showed the third quarter\nCould be as high as four percent so the economy in the U.S super strong and things really are very very positive which is why by the way also we'd had stock markets hitting\nAll time not so just notice things Connie are strong this was a very normal time just pull back in the market if anything is probably very healthy that we're seeing a pullback in America right now and\nJust notice the economy is doing really well the tax cuts that a huge impact and for the foreseeable future we see an economy that's continuing to grow\nDavid Baake always a pleasure thank you for your insights today begging my pleasure thank you\nWhat we think all of our listeners to listening to what they bark had to say he certainly had some compelling things to look at\nAnd these are concerns that a lot of us are facing we're ... we're getting close to her in retirement or really as our investments as a whole he talked about a lot of different things that are in the interview you know one of the things is is is getting your affairs in order it's nice to listen to the professionals and we're glad to have David Box piece of the show but\nWhat you really got to do is be able to sit down and get a plan put together for yourself\nAnd as we've talked about throughout our show and ... times throws shows is that we always offered twelve or listeners an opportunity to come in and get your map which is a process we have a name here which means meaningful laughs at position\nWhich is a way for you to really get a clear picture and find a partner to help you through the retirement process and making sure that you have the income that you need in retirement to make sure that your state planning to put together to make sure that you have tax clarity and retirement\nOut your retirement are there any gaps that need to be filled\nThey're going to help you along the way like I mentioned they help people retire every single day you and I are going to retire one time so they know all the ins and outs that you need to know\nSo tap into their resources are right there here for you five to zero three nine nine six three for one that's the number to call and also here's their Web site at retirement evolution\nIs Rhett Evo dot com R. E. T. E. V. O. L. dot com so it was just short for their business\nAnd then if you want to add the word map to it rats evil map dot com then you can play around with some tools and get started on your retirement journey so red Evo dot com or rat evil map dot com\nToday we're talking about making the right decisions at the right time of course we're talking about here for one case you're IRAs everything has to do with retirement how can proper asset diversification helps sustain a portfolio for the long run\nThis is certainly where you ballots risk and reward by giving up your assets in different investment products some solutions stocks bonds cash which typically move in different directions depending on the environment base of course on your goals risks tolerance and timeline\nWell they certainly don't guarantee returns stocks can provide solid growth opportunities growth that could help you address inflation overtime and that can be quite beneficial as inflation can certainly be up and over your retirement your purchasing power\nFor example financial services for fidelity found something with a price tag of fifty thousand dollars today like a car in twenty five years from now will cost as much as eighty two thousand at just a two percent inflation rate which is very low at a four percent inflation rate\nYears from now will cost as much as eighty two thousand at just eight to ... percent inflation rate which is very low at a four percent inflation rate the price tag would be just over a hundred and thirty three thousand\nAnd for our listeners today you need to understand that health costs your medical costs throughout retirement are increasing at a rate right now over four percent so I think that's a good number to pay attention to\nRight and what's more stocks that may be considered less risky\nThose that are retiring may gravitate toward in retirement depending on their risk and reward and comfort levels often payout admitted so they provide the potential for long term growth with the potential for a bit of income in fact the S. and P. five hundred index dividend yield was about to point two percent\nTowards the end of two thousand sixteen which was not too bad given the low interest rate environment\nNow obviously no investment strategy in the market guarantees a profit or that you will lose money but I weld diversified portfolio can help you move out the volatility of the market and offer you the opportunity for the opportunity for growth but a diverse asset mix is key\nTo help address off the risks of inflation longevity and market ups and downs\nSo portfolio construction is important but the other thing is is that you want to balance growth expectations with loss expectations\nWhen you're working I think a lot of our listeners don't pay too much attention to that because you're putting your money each month and year four one K. C. don't necessarily see the account go down as much because you continue to keep putting money in but in retirement you're no longer putting money in\nSo we're not saying not go for growth but temper your growth expectations and understand that slow and steady wins the race or retirement at least that's the belief that we have we're not saying eliminate growth but slow and steady wins the race\nAnd I think creating and then of course in so many and definitely periodically revisiting whatever the strategy is that you put in place for protecting your retirement nest egg that really presents a unique set of challenges\nAnd your challenges are going to be different than your neighbors and your neighbors are going to be different than their brother in laws and everybody's retirement is very unique\nSo really understanding exactly how to put that plan together\nHow to insulin in it and then how to make changes how to do those course corrections when you need to they are really important\nAnd you probably don't want to put those challenges in the hands of just anyone you want to work with people that are familiar with is that that are familiar with this process\nSo when you're among the first six callers who called five to zero three nine nine six three for one right now you'll get the customized complimentary map the meaningful asset position and again there is no obligation and when you called John carrot and a member of their team they were going to talk to you about your big picture\nAnd your dreams about retirement\nIf you'd like a higher level of certainty about your income and your financial well being during retirement pass this offer up if you want to make sure that you're going to be okay and retirement call this number five to zero three nine nine six three for one\nYou can call right now and go in and visit with them set up an appointment to go see them complimentary have you'd save two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement and giving them a call five to zero three nine nine six three for one what makes up in effect of income strategy that last John and care and share more insights\nComing up next this is retirement evolved with John ... with the rest of our show [noise]\nMedicare anyone Roman super team to December seventh and in the best time to get your plan review venison\nIt's October Fifteen to December seventh and it's the best time to get your planned review benefits pay and prescription drug formula airing these can all change every year and that's why you want to work with an independent license insurance broker like knee high I'm here in New Hampshire and\nI can make Medicare and easy to understand and make sure you are on the right plan for you for two thousand Nineteen\nI invite you to attend one of my many Medicare workshops were even schedule one on one Medicare review with me today don't delay\nMy office and called five to zero three Ninety nine\nString zero\nOnce again that number five she's zero\nThree four zero just let us know whether you like to attend a workshop where you'd like to have a one on one medical review I look forward to helping you soon\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to retirement evolved with John ... John Kerry to end their team at retirement evolution snow that the most important thing you can do for yourself and your family is to plan\nYour retirement which is why they did the show every week and we're not talking about just a little plan in your head but it needs to be written out so they are here to help you see with clarity where you're headed on your path ready to retire but\nDid they join and carrying a been giving us great insights on the timing of our MDs unqualified distributions for for one case and IRAs healthcare costs definitely need to be addressed in retirement how do you do that so that the assets and your retirement accounts don't quickly evaporate if a health issue comes up\nWell I think for folks to address their healthcare costs kind of depends on where they are in their retirement planning process so if you're going to retire at fifty five you're fortunate you've done a great job you've built your nest egg you've got your investment accounts that\nIf you're retiring early you've got ten years before you become eligible for Medicare so really making sure that you take a clear\nFocus to look on what you have access to as far as health insurance for that ten year period of time it's very important\nNow here in Tucson we had very limited individual plans available the last\nFew years I have a lot of challenging conversations with folks who are saying but I Want to retire and then saying well you can but here's what you're looking out for your health insurance costs so if you're an individual retiring at age fifty five and you know that your health insurance is going to run you seven eight nine hundred dollars a month\nAs soon as she retired you've got a factor that into your expenses until you become eligible for Medicare\nNow of course there's still costs associated with Medicare and once you turn sixty five we wanted to take a a careful look at how's your health how do you use your health insurance lots of\nFolks may choose to seek alternative health insurance so they may not want to pay a lot for health insurance plan doesn't cover alternative\nMethods that they're using anyway so just a lotta pieces that go into what do we do about health insurance and retirement again really depends on when you're retiring\nAnd which are options are at that time now the individual health insurance of course changes yearly Medicare plans changed nearly so these are things you want to make sure that you evaluate but I just spoke with a couple last week who said well we had budgeted\nTheir in their early sixties sixty sixty one and they said well we budget a twelve hundred dollars a month\nFor our health costs over the next five years well twelve hundred dollars a month isn't going to do it you won't be able to get your health insurance paid for it at twelve hundred dollars a month at that age much\nAbout twelve hundred dollars a month of I'm going to do it you won't be able to get your health insurance paid for it at twelve hundred dollars a month at that age much less\nBe able to factor in your additional health cash or co pay your insurance your ducked both all those out of pocket costs that come with health care as well so it really becomes a very important decision in your retirement planning and of course can have a huge impact\nOn you being able to live that life than you dreamed about all the planning you've done up to retirement can be for not if a catastrophic health and it's going to wipe out half of your retirement savings in a single year and then you get to go back to work and try and rebuild it again\nSo I think there's some other things to care for people that fifty five sixty five years of age age of say health savings account or something that maybe they should look into\nThe other thing that people could look into from health care standpoint as far as how we counsel and work with people as as long term care coverage you know long term care coverage can be

asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nStock market the sock continues as one day we're up and then the next day it's back down [noise] so what exactly is going on in the financial\nWorld and on Wall street and what's driving markets today now that the stock market has officially experience it confirmed stock market corrections were values dropped by ten percent or more for many peak volatility is back in a big way\nOne of the major factors that has led to this correction besides the ... market melt up we saw in January where we saw stock markets up over seven percent Justin one month alone\nIs now all the talk about the end of free money\nWell you may want to know what is exactly free money and why didn't you get any of it well you did actually in a way but maybe not how you exactly wanted to get it the end of free money is referring to the massive quantitative easing stimulus programs at the Federal Reserve\nEstablished shortly after the big financial meltdown in two thousand eight and two thousand nine\nThis economic stimulus was designed to boost the economy by injecting low cost or even no cost capital or money into the banking system and on Wall street\nThis is called in was called quantitative easing also known as Q. E. and we had to eat one do you eat two and three and then she we infinity\nNow here we are and the feds have officially ended quantitative easing back in two thousand Seventeen during this almost ten year\nAnd the feds have officially ended quantitative easing back in two thousand Seventeen\nDuring this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation was still very low and yes did it work maybe but what did this quantitative easing or this free money really give us well it gave us low interest rates and most of us have benefited from that in some sort of way\nPerhaps a low rate on a house or a car or a business loan we've become addicted to these low interest rates\nSo has Wall Street low rates also means low saving rates on bank money which causes us to seek higher returns elsewhere like in the stock market\nAnd well that has worked wonderfully over almost a full nine years now so here we are at a critical point in our history and our economy with inflation fears now at the forefront of discussion we've already seen interest rates now taking a little higher\nWe're now seeing spikes in the yields on what most consider a risk free investment and that is the ten year treasury note\nWhen inflation starts to become a problem well the Federal Reserve will respond and the only way they know how\nAnd that is by raising interest rates and when that happens when interest rates rise that can start to put the brakes on the economy and then our whole economic cycle starts to change and our time of grow turns into a time of contraction\nNot that that's the idea of the Federal Reserve to cause a recession but it's just the nature of the beast it's economics\nAnd when that happens or there is even the slightest indication of something like that happening Wall Street is way ahead of the game on this and we'll start to see yet another bear market and perhaps one like we've never seen before where we can see drops of at least fifty percent or more\nIn the depths of the stock market bloodbath after the crash in two thousand eight early two thousand nine the Dow Jones was trading adjust sixty five hundred that was the index level\nIf we returned to those levels again\nThat's a Seventy five percent drop from where we are today so again we're at a critical point one where the stock market still just hasn't made up its mind as to what it wants to do so why risk all your portfolio on something that seems to be just pure chance\nOur message here at Mayfield financial is different at our core is the principle of financial safety safety is our number one concern and priority that your money your savings that you work your whole life to get our protected\nIn this Wall Street dominated financial world that we're in too many investment advisers and individuals try to seek sky high returns and run the odds it's all probability based it's about calculating risk\nAnd hoping that a worst than worst case scenario won't ever happen during your retirement\nTo me and for all of us here at Mayfield financial that simply doesn't work\nI don't like running probabilities when it comes to retirement\nI Want certainties I Want guarantees I Want a retirement plan that puts safety first and where risk isn't measured by what stocks and bonds you have in your portfolio but as measured by their risk of losing your comfort\nYour house your income\nThese types of risks are there real risks we want to consider when planning for retirement\nSo there are many questions to answer when it comes to knowing what to do with your retirement money in your savings and how to best position yourself for the long term so what is the answer\nWell it depends it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met and want to continue the lifestyle that we're comfortable with throughout retirement\nSo here at Mayfield financial we are a safety first retirement planning from\nWe take a look at your retirement plan and

you tell me I don't like what the government's doing then don't agree with\nThem and don't apply them by sticking your head in the sand along with them\nPlease don't do that have enough\nTo pick up the phone and say Mara I Want to make a difference in my life and in my family's life tell me what I Need to do this is a business that we are in a business of advice look at where the economy's going look at\nHow they're spending is out of control what mark what do we do\nLook at how they're spending is out of control what mark what do we do\nI had this conversation last week with a couple of who came in\nAnd it was very easy for me to step them through the mental gymnastics of saying look if you're twenty five years old or you're Twenty years old you're probably going to be in a zero percent tax bracket the the lowest bracket you've ever been in and they're probably thinking themselves will Mark I'm not twenty five on sixty five\nOr Seventy but they know either their grandkids or other kids that are in their twenties what a great message that they can take somebody imagine this somebody here's my message they say they pick up the phone and they're calling young people saying I Need to take you out for a cup of coffee because I Want to tell you\nHow you can protect yourself from what's coming so I had this conversation I said imagine they're in their lowest lowest bracket ever is it fair\nFor the government to say we will allow you to postpone the taxes that you owe today which is oh by the waves zero\nAnd push it out to where you're sixty five or Seventy or Seventy five whatever they end up whatever age they ended up retiring at and now you're in a forty or fifty percent bracket you just just on the surface Tristan\nIs that fair but you know what people are doing it all the time they are\nConstantly doing it because the message from Wall street the message from our Congress the message from the four one K. providers and so on and so forth is\nDiffer differ differ\nBut look you're taking you the listener\nDoesn't care old you are you're taking on all the risk by putting money into those qualify plans and kicking it out to a what I can conceive of is going to be a much higher tax bracket\nYou're postponing the inevitable does it make sense to stop the madness today\nAnd put the money someplace where you pay the tax and get it over with and then all the gain all the girls all those accounts are going to earn are going to be yours tax exempt tax free\nSee on the surface that sounds magnificent doesn't it doesn't that sound like a winning game plan a winning scenario to us it\nDoes but I have to tell you most people they hear that message and they continue\nTo max out they're qualified plans are for one case there for all three bees they continue just to keep putting more and more money because they like that deduction which you know now listening to the show is simply a postponement of the inevitable\nThe vehicles that we encourage you to put your money's into by pain that tech city and getting it over with when you go to pull that money out none of that money none of those dollar show up on your ten forty form we think that's pretty magnificent\nNot only does it does not show up on your ten forty four and but it doesn't affect Social Security\nA lot of people come and they say mark this is it fair eighty five percent of my Social Security that I'm receiving each and every month each and every year as being taxed I Know I I go I Know\nHow do we stop the madness\nBy doing something about it today and you can start by making an appointment sailing I was always segue to that because that's the important thing to do is to make an appointment look if you haven't done it up to this point on your own then maybe you just have you had to raise your hand and say you know what\nOr thing to do is to make an appointment look if you haven't done it up to this point on your own then maybe you just have you had to raise your hand and say you know what I Need some help here mark you sound like a\nPretty responsible individual and upfront kind of guy you have a good attitude about this you're always so positive yes because as the people at the Texas ramp project are doing they're changing lives and that's what we're doing one life at a time\nAnd his ... and said they are doing that for a hundred and some times a year that's pretty magnificent we think we are as well so give us a call two nine six four four six four we will run for you complementary Social Security ... report we will do\nThe smart money master plan or the smart money timeline as it now is evolving into\nWe will do a ten forty review you might be thinking mark\nMan if if what you're saying is true that I'm In the lowest bracket today does it make sense for me to start shifting some of those retirement qualified dollars start paying the tax start getting the tax paid for it today and shifting them into vehicles were when I go to pull all that money out I pay zero taxes let's explore that\nTogether I Can't make a blanket statement over the airwaves\nI did a couple of months ago and I continue to even in our office and I will do that right now is that what if you could earn an additional thirty to fifty per cent on a guaranteed basis in retirement than what you projected what you're on a progression to make right now\nWould that be of interest to you thirty to fifty percent more mark are you kidding me of course I Would call you in a heartbeat okay a heartbeat about five just passed me saying all that\nAre so give me a call [laughter] to not yeah right tonight six four four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell two three five nine for six five this is important stuff\nIt's life changing it will change the trajectory of you and your family's life for ever but only if you decide now is the time I'm a big person I Want to make a change I Love my family I Love where you're going with this mark\nAnd if you do then I'm going to encourage you again give us a call set up a time come in and we're not going to bite you got to leave with all kinds of duties we're going to talk more about long term care life insurance\nAnd annuity they\nAnd you want to make sure you have done the very best job possible when it comes to ensuring your life\nThere are many people will say now mark you look I've heard this a ... whole life insurance I shouldn't even I I I've heard bad things about it I Googled it it says it's a lousy investment it's a horrible well what I say about ten minutes ago was\nLife insurance is not an investment\nHowever it has about thirty different benefits in comparison to maybe you're for all and K plan or your IRA or your brokerage account which doesn't have all those thirty different investment or those thirty different attributes so that's why it's important if you knew to be true wasn't\nWhen would you want to know I Hope you want to know\nToday Well Mark if I come into the office you're just going to try and sell me a whole life insurance no I'm not\nWe're going to have a count of a conversation about what you currently have in place and if we can put you in a better position if we can read deploy the dollars you're currently spending over here and move them to over here by the way I'm using hand signals writes us from here to here\nAnd it's more efficient for you and your family and you create an additional twenty or twenty five maybe even even thirty different benefits\nWould that be important to you\nWhen I bring people face to face with the amount of benefits they for all and K plan or a four oh three B or an a a a an IRA provide think about it just offhand what you get ready to return you get a postponement slash differ oh\nOkay well it's what if you become disabled no that plan stops what if you die there's no death benefit so there's there's only limited number of benefits into it with those vehicles now\nUh what if you die there is no death benefit so there's there's\nOnly a limited number of benefits into it with those vehicles now granted\nQualify plans under a risk the guidelines are creditor protected or life insurance always when you stack 'em up side by side I remember one time and I wrote down the list uh thirty different things\nBut I didn't title it I said would you like all these things in the next thing you purchase or going will absolutely those are those are incredible those are marvelous I said well it's life insurance and they look they ran like screaming down the street\nIt didn't make sense to me it's like you like all the benefits I just wonder if I call that my favorite thing called a peanut butter and jelly sandwich would that be more palatable it would be\nBut we have to at the end of the day tell you look this is what it is this is what annuities will do for you let's take longevity risk off the table right now let's stop the madness\nThe man is going to happen I have an article here and by the way if you'd like a copy of any of this or if you like what we call the optimize or packet\nI'll make sure all these articles are included a this article um where did I find this New York post it says a next crash will be worse than the great depression\nIsn't that uplifting isn't that how you want to start your weekend Mara great article hey yeah trust that yeah next trash will be worse than the great depression yes why because us households debt of Thirteen point three trillion\nTrillion with a T you guessed it last week if you didn't hear last week's show you need to go listen to trust and hit it out of the part\nThat Thirteen point three trillion now exceeds the two thousand a peak that's due in part to mortgage lending which is hovering near its decade ago level of nine trillion plus dollars\nStudent loans outstanding have sky rocketed think about this from six hundred and eleven billion in two thousand and eight to round one point five trillion\nToday and others yeah trust is like what can we stop the madness are there people want to say you know what they're going to point those yeah we need to stop the man is we need to give everybody free education\nLike that will happen auto loans at nearly one point two five trillion have exceeded the two thousand and eight total wild credit card balances are just as high now is before the great recession\nWhen is the madness going to stop you know what it's going to stop when you pick up the phone you say enough is enough\nMark I don't wanna fall prey yeah like ... hunker down right treason hunker down I don't want to fall prey to what you're saying is going to happen is going to come and what you say is inevitable\nThe madness demand this isn't going to stop as long as we have a Congress that refuses to look at the national debt as our biggest national security\nProblem it is but you know what it's not politically expedient politically expedient for them to say this\nIs because it's going to require them to say let's lower the debt ceiling let's increase taxes let's cut some of the benefits that Social Security Medicaid and Medicare or providing\nHow well is that going to sit with their constituency or not very well at all so they refused to do anything other than kick the can down that proverbial road stick their head in the sand and then say and give us lip service like they're really all about us\nA proverbial road stick their head in the sand and then say and give us lip service like they're really\nAll about us if you believe that then I'm Sorry\nThat's not what the truth is if what you knew to be true wasn't when when you want to know after today show you should be saying mark now's the time I Need to put a plan together if what you're saying is true how can these insurance companies\nHow will they fared during what you're saying is going to be a Great Depression worse than the great depression let me tell you this insurance companies are designed for times like this why\nBecause of what we called actuarial science\nActual real science is absent on Wall street actuarial sciences absent within all your brokerage accounts unless there's some annuities perhaps in those accounts [noise] X. oriole science\nIs not an individual stocks and bonds it just isn't it is inherent it's built in to why and what insurance cut why insurance companies do what they do and what they do they deal with the law of large numbers that's why\nYou would be silly to try and go this alone you need a partner with carriers with companies with concepts that are designed for times that we're going through right now out of control domestic spending\nOh domestic well meanwhile global debt a result of central bakers flooding economies with cheap monies to lift them out of a funk\nIs now to [laughter] interest in global debt two hundred and forty seven trillion dollars up from a hundred and Seventy seven trillion well\nMark that's only up Seventy trillion remember our little analogy last week a dollar a second you're going to hit a trillion dollars and thirty seven thousand thirty two thousand years thirty two thousand years of dollar second you're going to hit a trillion dollars oh markets only Seventy trillion\nIt's two and a half times the size of the global economy the debt the global debt is two and a half times the size of the global economy we won't be able to call her\nA recession is going to be worse than the great depression said economists commentator Peter Schiff\nForecasting a major economic downturn as early as the tail end of the Trump presidencies first term\nThe U.S economy is so much worse shape than it was a decade ago is let me read that the U.S economy isn't so much worse shape than it was a decade ago that's from a guy that's really\nIn the know he gets what's going he must listen to the show yeah Peterson a probably the census show yeah could be so you think about the warning signs\nWere up on the hill waving our hands jumping up and down sending you smoke signals sending you\nOver the airwaves this show saying what are you going to do\nWell Mark if all this is going to happen who really cares and just going to continue to do when I'm doing no let me let me make a comment here what if you were able to profit from that's going to it's kind of touched the greedy side
