just kinda like cool what's your home worth about ... what do you do on it I'm like okay one of the homes on your street so far on average\nUm how to relate [laughter] Hi\nOkay All right so you're right it's a barely at the top edge of the market\nRight yeah I read it last year\nYours is yours is not like double the average house on the street but it's one of the nicest one's\nDot com have a one hundred percent satisfaction\nGuarantee that means even if you missed measure or you pick the wrong color of their own remake your blinds for free you get free samples\nFree shipping and with the new promos they run every month you'll save even more years the promo code Ramsey to get the best deal Hanna is in Georgia so my husband and I are on baby step three be now what that means is\nThat they are debt free except their home life saved up their emergency fund a three to six months of expenses and three beam means beyond that they're saving for the down payment on our house\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World you're should\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty ...\nI mean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy if I did either one of them are guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty either way\nBut I'll tell you what I Would do I'd go to Disney yellow catch your part it's perfect age for that\nThe what I Would do I go to Disney yeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean\nRachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how ready time her husband had but they had a great time\nAnd um no I but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that you have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals\nBut I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency plan in place and then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some pretty good college and five and six is when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense that what you're working towards\nThe middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something and slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume and to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave out they paid you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received my commercial helicopter state ticket\nUm however I unfortunately I Need a by eighty hours or more training I got discovered a the industry is highly regulated by insurance and in order to become a share of NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to\nFigure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot and get the hours\nYou know I I ... a a a a job are there any Abbott is the single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you said the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off in bed and that's a\nThat's why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as a ... ... jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ... a yellow I Believe it or not firefighter or definitely make are\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yes that's that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work and ...\nThat's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show it forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited\nValue yeah it's not that ...\nThere's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this it's like it's like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just\nI feel I'm too far to say just\nWell I'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just\nGonna take me a little time does I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do their hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job generally up and they don't charge not worth that much\nYeah it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training in the first year\nNo mayor right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place\nI mean you've got connections in the fire department of their life like guys or something that you can get some hours in the coal policy can get some takeoffs and landings and get some of that council actually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a Robin ...\nAircraft gotcha not even\nTurbine yet but um I mean I I've even reached out to people on there on an aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those ... or ... and on for a chill out a lot of those guys are very busy\nSo I can get in our area now are there but nothing really calm and\nTo do you're going to end up paying for these hours what does it the eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty a three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and what kind of\nA deal you can get you know so\n... twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah definitely so ... yeah why not I I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I\nGot a I I collect handguns and shoot them a lot\nAnd uh and and also I burn through some ammo it's a but it's a ... I don't make any money doing them I'm trying to make money doing it but I was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies costs are on in this one was not going to cost you money to actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks into this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one year you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that\nYou know with that much intensity uh sometimes uh unemployed here or will pick up some\nIs there something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that you know without much intensity uh sometimes or an employer will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area\nTo help in destruction [noise] interesting\nThis Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the

sports was trafficking whether together in the hour during Sunday Morning news while you're on World War one teacher th\nRamsey show we are huge fans\nDon't believe that came to kill suffering under I get home turn into millionaires the original book\nStarted everybody talking about this back in the early Nineteen nineties when I wrote my first book when financial piece came out was a book called the millionaire next door\nBut Dr Tom Stanley change the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know Doug Stanley a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of there and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything and as you guys know Chris Hogan as a million or a book coming out in January\nBut Sarah for law is with us a Tom Standage daughter and uh this is the first time we've ever talked on the airwaves topped off the air and she has a new book coming out of the in well almost some of her dad's original research so Hi Sarah how are ya\nI'm good how are you having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah it's um it was a labor of love and I have a father but it out and like I like about it you know if\nYou guys didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago it was a\n... dollar Fifteen right yeah but\nI'm thinking I remembered that about the ... uh we had had him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nAlthough some of the mythology litters around millionaires so uh you used some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and and I put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what about this or did you do and more of it was combined with what he had done\nThat trade had we had worked together really on the NFL fair day for the buck on you know really started back and Keith outage thinking about the ... anniversary of the millionaire next door like he came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what books should include and got to the point when we were about to send out a survey on our sample of a ... and and he was killed by by a drunk driver\nAnd and go really he wasn't able to either data and compare it to be fair and Nineteen Ninety six and and be on um so that's kind of where I took out a chicken project and and kept going with\nSarah is an industrial psychologist and president of data points that research and\nTechnology company that studies wealth accumulation and builds tools to help and you guys have to check this out its um data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well which you can get the new book the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore\nBut that um some of them escaped though in that kind of behaviors that millionaire make related to investing and I think what was tied in with\nYou know just like any of us that are trying to do the right thing um millionaires make mistakes along the way to end that will lead to a lot of that sort of the ... the ... the role that they make related\nTo him but I think that that was surprising and then I think what was surprising to is that why hasn't things in terms of the kinds of or rather the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things that are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nA key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you hang around with and I see on the back of your book and understanding how those around you influence your financial by ... what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it's very clear from the work that we've done both with populations and and the every every day folks like I like\nThat they are um that that that social indifference that not caring about what others driving and buying and wearing is a really key factor in building well no it's related to network regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it's really hard to ignore right what other people are doing the actual media and so forth but it continues to be there are just not caring about what other people is unreal that it is one of the wave itself well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits going broke what I'd do it in my twenties where his violently was on ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive and thrive\nAnd reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think there was a big contributor\nTo me personally you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it
