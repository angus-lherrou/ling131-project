over and walk into retirement evolved John Margot inherent damn sense have retirement evolution right here in Tucson\nAnd Karen is the director of resolutions wealth solutions for women here at retirement evolution is not even how you doing today\nI'm a man I'm doing great excited to be here\nAnd myself as well excited to get to show the road\nTo ... me too and the first question I Want to start off with is what put on the minds of the retirees in the pre retirees who met with you at retirement evolution is this past week\nWell Louis and I think I'll jump in and answer that in the past couple of weeks in particular we've had a lot of clients come in and the stock market's going a little bit rocky at I think one of the common things just beyond the concerns about to be ... or or countering that everybody that we're having with other countries are so that's making the markets a little bit rocky\nSo I think that's a concern is kind of the on known as things continue to move forward but some of that kind of pressures on the market have certainly been a concern and certainly but at the forefront for the folks who've been talking to over the last couple of weeks\nAnd I suppose that it just makes some people just a little bit fearful of what's going to happen to their own retirement portfolio\nAnd that kind of brings us to our topic today we're going to address some of the most common many mistakes that can be made you know sometimes one financial decision can really set sort of a chain of reaction that affects the overall health ever retirement portfolio\nAnd so today we're going to discuss those common many mistakes and strategies to address them so that you can focus less on finances I'm more on the phone parts of retirement that's what we all like to think about I think that's why so many people procrastinate about planning their retirement\nSo let's go ahead and get started with these common many mistakes wasn't money mistake that you see quite often\nI think one of the big mistakes we the really it's that kind of domino effect\nWhen you think of a domino effect it really applies to money matters especially retirement money matters because like you said Lou and sometimes just one element and can set off a chain reaction whether it's a product or an overall investment decision or strategy and that can really affect\nOther pieces of the retirement down the road so I think the first money mistake we should always address is not having a budget\nWill care and you mentioned the word budget so are you talking about having a budget before you retire you say and set aside plans or are you talking about a budget while you're retired\nWell both actually so if you're not yet retired you need to gain and understanding of what money or funding is coming in\nAware that money's going on a monthly basis folks have access to a lot of different tools these days and a variety of apps like men ... or you need a budget pocket guard and there are other tools out there the states as well that can really make tracking your expenses pretty paying with\nYou know I wanted to add actually cure to again for ... for this right away but we have an easy way on our website if you go to red Evo map dot com R. E. T. V. O. map dot com we have a budget and tool in there for our listeners as well so that's also hopeful\nWe sure do we sure do and for folks that have credit\nCards usually the company issuing the card provide some sort of any will spending summary or something like that that will show how much you spent\nAnd then they tend to break it down into pretty basic categories like dining in entertainment groceries gas so it's not always a hundred percent but it's good guide and sometimes with thirty thousand so you can really be Iowa opening into looking at your spending patterns over the course of a year and if you're being honest\nYou probably already know whether you're spending more or less than you're bringing home\nHow much so that's why it's really important to attract the expenses both essential and non essential\nSo will you talk about\nThose essential and non essential you know the discretionary non discretionary expenses for a moment\nWell of course so essential expenses if we kind of think of map\nOf hierarchy of needs right we've got things like housing or transportation insurance food those types of things that are essential to just getting by\nDay to day and depending on how much of your income those essential expense of takeout that will help show you how much you can spend on non essentials so I Know the way and you like to throw out those rules of thumb so I'll give you ... guideline guy\nAnd there is what we call the fifty thirty twenty rural and the idea behind that is approximately fifty percent of your after tax dollars go to those essential expenses says necessities right your housing your food et cetera and then thirty percent at\nThem knows goes to your non essential and then twenty percent or more goes toward savings and ordered debt payment depending on where you are in that\nProcess and this may sound a little tedious but really knowing your budget and the breakdown of your fences both essential and non essential and truly knowing how much you're spending every month really does help ... foundation so you can reach your long term financial calls\nAnd yet there are financial professionals out there just like the two of you that thrive on helping people with all of this and they helped them put their time about finances back on track Johnny care that would be you as well right\nDo you think that some people avoid inactivity and if so why do you think that\nWell I Do think some avoid them and that's generally because I knew what he has a reputation for being complicated and potentially high priced both statements have the potential of being true if you don't work with a trusted financial professional experienced in the arena of annuities\nAnd if you don't get the right annuity for your particular situation that I think some of those things that I said it'd be for true you know of them being complex and possibly high priced instead take the time to find a financial professional\nWho's experienced in the arena of annuities ask those you trust for recommendations and do your own research interview before signing anything\nSo this kind of comes down to what type of agents are you working with are you working with the one who is captive versus one who is independent\nYou know I kept a financial professional is required to so only the products offered by their company working with a captive financial advisor or insurance agent may limit access to the product services and strategies that are tailored to you and your individual circumstances\nFor instance somebody worked for X Y Z company and that's the only type of annuity product they sell is XYZ company that company might have a decent product but I've got to tell you in this arena it's very very big arena and there's a lot of different providers and it's very competitive\nSo just being stuck with one particular captive agent would be potentially limit your options and when it comes to retirement you always want to have good options so that brings us to an independent advisor agent that has new restrictions and can offer products from multiple providers they have more latitude as they just shared with you to comparison shop\nAcross the broader range of investments and insurance options to find one that suited\nPerhaps at a lower cost to their client\nSo again this is what I found for a lot of folks that have come into my office maybe they've worked with their local property casually person and they mentioned X Y Z annuity product I don't want to call out any companies I think there's a lot of find companies here in town but that property casually person or that insurance agent then presents only what that company has to offer\nAnd then someone will come in here and they'll say hey can you take a look at the should we do this and then we look at all the various other options and they find out that maybe there was some better choices because here in our office we are independent and were license with multiple different carriers your twenty thirty forty different carriers for us to be able to start helping\nThe folks that we work with make better decisions I hang up so exciting yeah yeah\nYeah so we want it to do that and as we talked about before independence\nWas important to us we didn't want to be beholden\nTo any one company we wanted the opportunity to share the best options available you know there is another important factor considered and that is the standard to which a financial professional is obligated to adhere to as a result of their professional licenser designation so financial advisors who are held to what's called the fiduciary standard must\nBy law put client's interest above their own at all times being a fiduciary means they are obligated under the terms of their professional licensed to always put the best interest of their clients first above their own interest and those are there for or their company which products and services they represent\nThey must also disclose all material conflicts of interest that arise if any so it is very important that you try and align yourself with somebody who has what we call it ... says\nJohn I hate to say that I think that if somebody were not fishy I feel like they might have beat around the ... [laughter] maybe when\nI'm like man I don't know about that the job on the show isn't too ...\nAnd he actually read and I think getting help is always better than not getting how right\nBut I Do think that once you're in that helping range if you want to get yourself maybe a little bit better position is maybe find somebody who is independent maybe somebody who can help you out\nAnd who is truly working towards your particular situation that and that's for each of our listeners to strike you're out on their own of course I just think that's important that they kinda get the confidence and answering that question themselves okay\nVery good okay so that's that's finding the right professional now what about finding the right a new witty\nWell first of all many financial professionals dealing with a new to ease myself included suggest that only a part very important only a part of your retirement portfolio should be used for nudity\nThen we look at the different types there are what we call immediate and deferred depending on when the payments are needed and then the underlying types do you want a fixed annuity do you want a variable or do you want what's called an indexed annuity which depend on your knees objectives and tolerance for risk\nYou know if there are liquidity concerns an immediate annuities can be the right way to go where there is a is a leg from when you pay the insurance company for the policy to win the insurance company starts paying you it's usually only about thirty days so you put the money in and they start creating an income stream for you\nFor other folks are you know a deferred annuity you don't have to put down such a large sum up front but you have the option to build up funds overtime with monthly contributions to add to it so later on you can get a larger income stream if you so desire\nDebating about an annuity it pays to plan ahead and as we mentioned to work with a trusted financial professional well versed in all things annuities to help decide if one is right for you\nAnd given that it it ... you know star ability is to provide guaranteed income or it is a product worth exploring when you're planning for retirement you know the way and I just spent a lot of time talking about annuities and annuities you know for some people can be a good option\nFor people that are looking to solidify their income picture during retirement but you have to ask yourself the question is an annuity right for you and your situation and if so what kind of annuity makes the most sense for you\nThe answers to these questions will certainly become much clear what do you have an objective review of your retirement assets and your retirement picture and one of the things we can do here is provide this review through what we call our map process or meaningful asset positioning to see if an annuity\nIs a good fit for you and in your retirement plans\nWe know you're busy and so are they that they set aside a limited number of times to visit for the next ten to call today during our show five zero three day nine sixty three forty one if you call right now you'll get a customized map\nThis meaningful asset positioning that John Kerry and are talking about together you will create this and you'll be able to rely on their professional\nExperience and knowledge as you plan to retirement so it is critical that you get independent guidance from a tree professional who can say all of your options so get started on creating this map\nBe one of the next ten powers five to zero three nine nine six three for one it never hurts to get a fresh perspective on your retirement means and how it might even meet them call right now\nDuring our show five twenty three nine nine six three for one you can leave a message in China care and we'll get back with you All right so in a new could be a good option for those who need it to address the shortfall and the budget before we go out\nSeeking any annuity\nAbout our budget that we should try to understand before we do that on our own\nActually yes which brings me ... money concern and again this ties back to ...\nIt can be a mistake not knowing how much of your savings you can withdraw anyway for income throughout\nYour retirement All right Karen I Know you're alluding to that four percent rule aren't you\n[laughter] you know how it like roulette flu and we don't have a reckoning surely\nThat's where we're going so well that four percent rule it's really more of a three to five percent rural it is a rule of thumb never first to understanding how much you can withdraw from your overall savings portfolio each year so your savings can last as long as you do\nSo I Want to jump in here real quick\nThe four percent rules just again to bring clarity is drawn no more than four percent on an annual basis\nAnd then that helps you keep up with inflation and its inflation adjusted inside your portfolio but this rule is really important\nTo make sure that your expectations are set straight in retirement if you're walking in the door and looking at your retirement dollars and you're expecting withdraw ten to twelve percent you're going to put all sorts of pressure on the rest of your portfolio to help maintain that because that means you kind of have to have that same rate of return or very close to it\nSo that your dollars last throughout your lifetime so the four percent rule or three or five percent and then again each household is quite different\nSo that's why we don't like to stick to these darn straight rules here in our office but it is a good starting point to look and work off of and it is quite important to their retirement planning process you know retirement is a big picture and it's not as simple as it used to be we used to retire we had\nOur pensions we had our Social Security is we had some money in savings but the game has changed and now is retirees we're much more responsible because a lot of\nPensions have gone away we're much more responsible for what we have to put together and that's where someone can help you put together and periodically help you out throughout her retirement by revisiting your strategy so finding a partner in retirement hope you maximize your retirement assets can be quite helpful\nBecause as I mentioned there's a whole new world of complex set of challenges\nAnd these are challenges that you probably don't want to put it in the hands of just anyone\nRight so why not put your life savings in the hands of inexperienced financial professional who focuses on retirement means and I'm Talking about John and Karen and they had set aside ten visit them when you're one of the first caller's on our show today at\nFive to zero three nine nine six three for one you will gain access to the team at retirement evolution still going to sit down with you you're going to look at the big picture together talk about your knees your was your goals and then based on that conversation that provide you with a map\nTime horizon or when you need the money what your overall portfolio looks like and so on\nYou know we put stocks and a mutual funds exchange traded funds inside of a portfolio to help you gain the potential for growth and keep up with inflation you also have to look at kind of a bucket strategy you need to have cash available for emergencies and withdrawals\nThese investments can be in the form of many different things individual stocks or mutual funds and verbally locusts mutual funds\nThere's also a great variety of E. T. S. and also what we called target date funds that are available some portfolios also may include real estate or if so called our tour of investments a catch all category for anything that doesn't fit in the other categories\nRegardless of category diversification is achieved by spreading assets appropriately across in with in these asset classes\nBut there's a very important key to the mix and the dynamics of this type of structure inside your portfolio if you are too conservative you'll probably miss out on the long term growth of the stock market and if you are too aggressive you may face too much risk when the market as volatile so good balance in your portfolio is quite important\nNow to determine the percentages there are lots of places that uh it is available online to kind of look up and look at what percentage is you have or you could really instead of using these tools that could be a little bit arbitrary you could sit down and talk with a qualified professionals\nWho can really be helpful and financing your strategy to suit your needs and what you need in your retirement\nNow with any type of investment product you definitely want to be aware of the fees though right\nWhich brings me to the next big mistake is not being aware of fees let's talk about fees for a second yeah no matter how you invest Lewin whether you do it on your own you work with somebody or you do some sort of hybrid I strategy there's going to be cautious and fees involved in that process\nSo some people want to do it all on their own because they want to save on fees but then a lot of as we talk about on these shows sometimes mistakes can be made\nAnd those mistakes can be tens of thousands of dollars or even more depending on the mistakes they make and it could be a tax mistake than what I mean by that is positioning themselves were there not tax efficient down the road so when it comes to fees what you really do need to know though is what you're paying for and what you're getting in return for those fees\nSo if you're advisor hasn't sat shootout or if you don't have an advisor you need to find somebody who can sit you down and really do a full analysis of the fees inside your account\nAnd then you have to start weighing out is that the worth what you're getting in return or there may be a better alternative which maybe you can be taking on less risk but getting the same amount of return or flipping one investment from one type to another which has\nHas a lower cost because of the structure of the investment so I think it's very important and this goes all the way into the for one k.'s and lots of other investments which you need to pay attention to that\nNow beyond the count types investment products like mutual funds they have these two right\nRight so I just kind of just briefly touched on the inside your four one K. you want to pay attention to fees but yeah like I said before all different types of accounts mutual funds being included or investments\nHave cost and mutual funds is one area where it's still we sometimes see significant cost and we're not seeing the gain the gain is inappropriate to the costs that you're paying inside that fund\nSo there are some ways that you can kind of move from mutual funds to what are called exchange traded funds which lowered the internal costs significantly so I'm not talking about the cost of the advisor\nBut the cost of the position itself which you could move into these ATS where you have significantly lower cost potentially but yet the same returns or maybe even better over time so it's important to look at that and look at your advisory relationship if you work with a financial professional insure you understand any management fees associated with your portfolio\nThere's often the assumption that when it comes to investments you get more if you pay more\nAnd what I was saying earlier as you need to understand are you getting the value for what you're paying for but realize that every dollar you pay for management fees are trading commission says simply one less dollar that's potentially earning on your behalf\nSo you can reduce the investment costs that come out of your pocket simply by the investments you choose and the funding for professional you choose to do business with so this was always an eye opening area for the folks that we work with when we do what we call a feat analysis\nSometimes people come in and they have lower fees that what we're doing a lot of times people come in and have higher fees but it doesn't matter if they come in with lower or higher it's what value they're getting and what they see the long term do they feel like they're closer to their goals and objectives and that's the real key\nAnd that's part of what we talk about in our map process\nAnd we believe everybody should have the lifestyle that they desire and the dreams that they have for their retirement and the best way that we see for a lot of folks who do that\nIs maybe get the assistance of a financial professional you know someone who has the knowledge not only in the investment world but also in the insurance world and all the other tools to help make sure that their life savings is in a well thought out retirement strategy\nAnd again every strategy starts with an analysis and so if you're one of the first people to call during our show today five to zero three nine nine six three for one\nJohn and Karen are offering to provide you with a map a meaningful asset positioning and you can go and visit with them you do need to call during our show five to zero three nine nine six three for one\nWhat other many concerns do people need to be thinking about so that our savings can last as long as we do in retirement find out coming up next you're listening to retirement evolved with John long ago and caring damn sense to tire of an evolution fully right back [noise]\n\n\n\nIt's Medicare annual enrollment period and that's all the time to get your Medicare plan reviewed insurance plans change from year to year plan that what's right for you this year not be right for you next year\nHi I'm here in New Hampshire and I'm an independent licensed insurance broker and co host of the radio show retirement involved\nI live and work right here in Tucson and I can help you review your Medicare insurance plan options for two thousand

have a one on one Medicare review or you'd like to attend a workshop and they can give you more information once again that number is five to zero three nine nine six three four zero and I look forward to meeting\n[noise]\n\nHello there welcome back just as retirement evolved with John boggle and Karen ... former and Karen\nHow their mistakes might we'd be making in our portfolio that could undermine our retirement plans what do you think\nYou know this has come up quite a bit over the last few weeks so you definitely want to make sure that your strategizing and setting aside money specifically earmarked for health care costs\nHealth care's expensive plain and simple and that is not going to get any cheaper in fact health care prices have risen at a faster rate than inflation usually at a rate of five or six percent a year\nIn the individual market we've seen increases just an insurance and the Seventeen to twenty five percent rate a year\nSo when you hit retirement and you have a limited income you're living on your fixed income now health care expenses can quickly dream your account so you need to make sure you've got a plan for that\nAnd for our clients I really like to use a number of different strategies in planning for and moving toward retirement in regards to health care expenses so the first one is an each essay and an eight to say as a health savings account\nAnd it is a design mainly to give consumers with qualified high deductible health care plans a tax break for their out of pocket medical expenses so from attacks perspective health savings accounts or a no brainer your contributions into them while you're working or tax\nDeductible second money saved into the H essay the current annual limit is thirty four fifty for an individual or sixty nine hundred for families\nThat many inside the age that they can grow tax deferred and then when you withdraw the funds as long as you use them for qualified medical expenses you also get to take the money out tax free to cover those qualified medical costs that is wonderful it is it can be a great vehicle for people\nBut again if the planning vehicles or if you're already in the middle of retirement you're sixty five sixty seven Seventy years old\nAnd they just say isn't going to work for you because they're only available to those under age sixty five\nBefore you're eligible for Medicare\nThe eligibility to contribute to an eight to say is centered around when you actually trigger your Medicare part and be so it can be a very complicated process you definitely want to make sure you talk to somebody who knows what they're doing before you decide what you're doing with an H I'd say right very good\nNow how is Medicare fit in in this approach\nWell generally speaking Medicare part D Day which is gonna be the hospital insurance it's kind of covered those expenses if you're admitted to a facility at some sort and then you've got Medicare part B which is going to cover everything happens when you're not admitted to a facility with the exception of drugs drugs are separate piece of Medicare\nThrough Medicare they're also some private insurance options for expanding your healthcare coverage\nOf course they may or may not have additional monthly premiums but there's definitely some options to be explored that can really help pick up any of those costs that original Medicare does not cover and well Medicare has the fees and the exclusions the benefits inside of the Medicare program and general can really add up\nPerformance is not indicative of

clients\nWe oversee more than one hundred million dollars in safe money client funds right here in Tucson and have over one thousand clients that enjoy our retirement income planning strategies\nSo what do we do and why do our clients love us it's pretty simple we are safe money advisors and for that certain part of your portfolio we do not recommend or use any strategies or investments that have a potential to lose money from stock market risk\nWe have never had to have a conversation with any of our clients about why they lost money due to stock market performance\nNo of course we're more than just one trick pony is over here and Mayfield financial over the years we have assembled an entire team a financial specialists that can take care of everything you need in the financial world in retirement\nBut here at Mayfield financial we believe and know that getting this first part of your retirement plan the safe money income part is so crucial so we focus entirely on that\nAs safe money specialists in the financial world we can help you turn that part of your retirement portfolio into what it needs to be in retirement and that is income income that last one that grows and is protected\nAnd now it doesn't have to be income that starts right now some of the best planning takes place about five years before you need to start to use your nest egg in retirement before you start to need to get that income\nSome call it the retirement danger zone and that's about five years before and after you retire that's the time where it's most\nAnd speak with their retirement income specialists one that can create a guaranteed income stream and protect your retirement from stock market losses\nIt's about building a foundation of income from that part of your portfolio to create the income for that you are going to want to have in retirement one that will take care of your essential to cover your needs to take care of those basic expenses\nWhen you do that you unlock inability to truly have a worry free retirement\nSo to learn more for yourself on a stabbed wishing a foundation of income and about working with a retirement income specialists and to learn a little bit more about Mayfield financial\nAt the time that we need to convert assets\nInto income and in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you were a super rich\nThis second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan and it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan\nAnd some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action but in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of them and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement\nEspecially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives\nThis is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four O. one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track however as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later\nFor one case and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee it income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four oh one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and then the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey failed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees\nThis is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan\nAnd we've been doing it here for over twenty five years and we believe and know that for at least eight part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income\nYear after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plants do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive\nAll with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no commissions paid by you so what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get more information on how a safe

just a a bright shining face this time of the day glad to see [laughter] and ah let's let's Harper right to our salute to America\nBoy mice allude to America I could probably take up the whole show talking about this but uh I was traveling last week to see my brother in the Sacramento area uh he's in the radio business and we are put to putting something together that's very special that\nProbably over the next couple of months we will be rolling it out can't let the cat out of the bag quite yet but one of the uh uh we had an opportunity to go to a multiple sclerosis\nAdvancements center and I'll tell you I'm going to talk about this as the salute today because it really changed my life it it really hasn't been looking at things in\nA different manner I actually call it's actually called the multiple sclerosis achievements Centre located\nIn the Sacramento area and we specifically we're on a mission on an assignment to go visit with a gal who's now in her mid seventies and uh for a number of years had been a in a number of TV commercials and the uh the eighties in the nineties\nAnd also on Mork and Mindy so we got to ask her a little bit about all the cast and\nCertainly Robin Williams and Pan Am ... and all that but why we were there was to talk to her and to get a sense in a feel for where she was diagnosed\nWith multiple sclerosis about Fifteen Years ago and not knowing really what we were going to be experiencing we got to meet the people behind the scenes who work with these individuals so the salute to America not only goes out\nTo those who have this dreaded disease and who are wheelchair bound but to those who have given their lives to serve these people are the achievement center is one of six year in the United states\nAnd what was fascinating was the spirit the the esprit de corps\nThe entire atmosphere of everybody who was there which there were probably about twenty five people there\nAre in wheelchairs and their outlook on life now this was a Thursday that we were there and one of the gentleman that we spoke with a quadriplegic\nAll he could do he had a little instrument that was about just right across from his mouth the little ball that he would be able to use a computer he could talk\nBut he couldn't move anything and had it not been for that apparatus and somebody had just done a screen shot of from the torso up you would never know that this gentleman\nUm whose name was Bob was was a quadriplegic but he made a comment he said\nThursday is the most important day of the week to me this is what I live for and if you think you're having a bad day 'cause you're French fries or cold for McDonald's or Starbucks messed up your drink think about these individuals\nWho\nAre wheelchair bound and who are dependent upon others to help them and so I asked the question I said Bob at what point did you realize that you had to surrender\nSo that you would then allow other people to help you because you cannot feed yourself you can't shave you can't bays you can't do any you are one\nOr in a worst position by not having the right types and kinds and amount of life insurance in place and number two is disability this was interesting or going back to my\nMultiple sclerosis achievement center it was a\nUnsolicited but ah the gal who we were talking with said mark and my brother Paul uh I got to tell you something\nBecause I asked her how you doing right now financially how are things going for you she said there was a young man who had just gotten into a life insurance business and I felt very sorry for him\nAnd so what I did and she was a member of the Screen Actors guild she said I bought\nA disability policy and I bought a long term care policy from this gentleman because I felt sorry for him fast forward\nTo today she is still receiving benefits from that\nPolicy and from that long term care policy now unbeknownst to her at that time she thought she was doing him a huge favor and perhaps she was financially\nBut in retrospect and look at how much of a great thing he put in place for her had she not had those two things to be drawing income from who knows where she would be so disability is number two number three is retirement the goal today\nIt's the try and get the highest rate of return they can from their portfolio in my opinion whether that's in a four one K. plan or an IRA or in a brokerage account that should not be the focus the focus should be our use saving a enough money to day\nTo make it through retirement it's not about rate of return it's how much are you saving and if you're in your thirties in your forties you should be saving about Fifteen Percent of your income that's what you should be saving for\nRetirement don't look at me that waitress in your ... perhaps his thinking man Mark I'm nowhere near that amount okay Fifteen Percent as you get closer and closer to retirement because hopefully you bought all the stuff you've taken most of the trips you've done most of the improvements around the house\nLet's try and raise that between twenty and twenty five percent it's not about ready to return\nIt's about how much are you said are you giving yourself a chance a shot at making it through retirement by saving enough\nMoney not just about rates of return we're gonna talk about this during the second half of our show today it's not about assets when you get into retirement it's about income and for many people that's very difficult to digest but I digress let me go back to the fourth peril and the fourth Farrell is long term care\nI'm a broken record yes but it's so important that people get their arms around having an elder care plan in place that addresses the need should want to rise when it comes to having\nA life changing event something that's debilitating perhaps you're able to stay in your home but for many people it's they have to go to a skilled nursing facility and assisted living facility of some type\nDo you have a plan in place I mentioned the perfect the ideal plan\nAnd what does this half it has everything to do with the five perils of life the five perils of life are always addressed in the perfect ideal financial plan that's what we'll do a number five our taxes\nI Want to read you something here that are just really just came across\nIn one of my emails recently there's a new movie I've I've talked to this is a this is a different kind of movie but I've talked to a book about a book called the power of zero which addresses the fact that it is a possibility for some people that when they get into retirement\nThey are in a zero percent\nTax bracket well this has been so profound this information has so been so moving and so stirring they're actually coming out with a movie I think it's going to be released\nSometime this month if not in November called the power of zero with the subtitle that tax train is coming\nAnd it's a major Hollywood documentary with an all star cast George Shultz PHD's David Walker\nWho used to be the controller general for the United states it's lot who many people know as Mr IRA he's been on PBS a number of times gentleman named Tom Heck no who we've actually had on our show Ben Miller and then David mic night the gentleman who's really responsible for the content the power zero\nAnd it takes it an in depth look at how the U.S national debt is ...\nThese tax increases within the next ten years and how they'll impact a retiring generation of baby boomers it says this is the first movie ever\nEver to explore our nation's looming debt crisis and the proactive measures baby boomers people like you and me can take to protect their retirement plans from the crush\nOf higher taxes so this is going to going to be released nationwide pretty soon here because the movie makes the contention taxes will be increasing\nTax deferred accounts like four O. one K. plans and I are age or a huge liability in a rising tax environment think about that many of you who have four one K. plans you're thinking mark what in what are you talking about\nYes the movies going to discuss why tax deferred accounts like four one K. plants in IRAs or a huge liability in a rising tax environment it makes sense doesn't it the map doesn't lie if you get out to retirement and you're in a higher bracket because the government\nDesperately needs money although all those funds that you do Ford's way way back twenty thirty maybe even forty years ago when you were in a lower\nTax bracket being pulled out in higher bracket is that fair well does anything the government do is does anything that they do fair I don't think so\nAnd why baby boomers point number three in this movie why baby boomers should consider transferring money into tax free alternatives like Ross IRAs and life insurance while taxes are still historically\nLow so we talked about that wow it's\nGreat that they're actually coming out with a major motion picture documentary\nThat talks about this it's just not\nMartin Kenney here in little Tucson, Arizona this is going to hit the theaters across the country this is life changing information the question is are you going to pick up the phone and give us a call and say mark you talk about this I Want to know if I'm a candidate how can I possibly get in these zero tax bracket is that even possible\nWhat can I start doing today now maybe it won't get you to eight zero but what if we can save your ten Fifteen Percent maybe even twenty percent would that be worth it to you is that worth picking up the phone and giving us a\nCall we think it is and then on the flip side what if we can get you another thirty to fifty percent increase to retirement income guaranteed\nWe've seen it as high as Ninety percent mark that sounds way too good to be true well some of those things in life that do sound too good to be true are indeed true this is one of those things take me up on

N. and noble a Nobel laureate in economics so this guy you know this does capture your attention when you find out this guy's a Nobel laureate in economics he's probably got some interesting things to talk about\nHas to do is really the absence nowadays of what we call pension plans and what has happened over the years and he points it out and most of us who are forties fifties or sixties know that\nFour one K. plans have for the most part replaced pension plans and\nTraditional at well what's interesting to me is how can we get back how can you as a consumer who maybe doesn't have the opportunity to become involved in a traditional defined\nBenefit pension plan how can we get you back there\nWell we can do it through what we call lifetime income annuities because traditional defined benefit pension plans were conceived and managed really in essence to provide members with a guaranteed lifetime income\nBut we're we we are really attacking this field called retirement planning really reverse in reverse as I said in the first portion of our show many people are focused on look at what my four one K. plan returned last year\nLook at the rate of return I receive look at how well it did it make it to say that regardless of how much they put in\nBut if your goal is to make sure when you get out of retirement that you're going to be receiving X amount of dollars in income irrespective of the rate of return\nIt achieved over your lifetime then wouldn't you want to know today if you were actually putting in\nEnough money that's the goal the goals should be mark when you come in and am I putting away enough money in retirement assuming I'm going to earn ... percent on that money to even have a chance\nOf making it\nIf nobody has ever shown you what that's going to look like\nThen perhaps you need to pick up the phone and you should call us if nobody has ever shown you based upon what you're doing right now how much you are going to have in retirement\nThan shouldn't you know today so if if indeed one of our recommendations is Mr and Mrs client you need to be socking away more money you've told us\nThat you're comfortable with assuming you're going to earn five six seven percent on the money that you are investing in your four one K. plan but what if you are not putting enough money aside\nWouldn't you want to know that today\nMost people would say yes I Want to know that today but then when you get out to retirement let's assume\nYou've met with us we've shown you what you need to do today because you're maybe ten Fifteen Years away from retirement or if you're a young person like for instance how can I get started to date what instruments do I need to be looking at today so that I have a chance and I have options when it comes to retirement\n\nWe will show you those instruments we will help you navigate the maze of different products that are out there in the marketplace all the noise that you hear through the different mediums be at TV or radio or newspapers or magazines or the Internet or social media Mark I'm confused what\nDo I do\nYou come in and you tell us your story you then clearly help us to define what is available and what you can or cannot do with where you are correct\nAnd so over the last year probably use the mountain climbing example you're climbing up the mountain that's the accumulation phase you've reached that to the top you plant the flag you're smiling from\nShe the cheek you're so happy you made it but now you have to descend go down back to the bottom to Base Camp that's called retirement\nAnd that's where most of the tragedies most of the injuries most of the ... Fe Taleb these occur is because it's the most dangerous track\nThat you could have won it means climbing up or down the mountain it's the downward descent\nSo we will help you understand how important it is and what priorities you need to establish today because the trouble is that most people have the wrong goals they have the wrong measurements and\nUnfortunately Wall Street has been very misleading and a lot of circumstances and so our goal is to help you obtain a crew of creed accumulate the right amount of money so that when you do get to retirement you have any chance of\nMaking it the ideal plan takes all of that into account and that's why an\nAnnuity for many people is the answer because the annuity mimics or mirrors what many defined benefit plans\nDid for many people who are retired maybe Fifteen twenty Thirty years ago many people maybe who are listening are receiving pensions why don't we create your own personal private pension plan we can do that the sooner you get started the better\nAnd so we're probably going to I'm probably going to include this piece in the optimize our packet called the crisis in retirement planning\nSee it's not about assets in this article goes on to say is that risk should be defined from an income perspective\nNot from an asset perspective it's about income in retirement it's not about assets and I see people struggle with that particularly the gentleman that come into our office because they still have working it's alive and well what we call the G factor it's greed\nThey want the most amount of income so when I say I would if I can get your thirty to fifty percent they get all excited they like that\nBut I one of my goals is I have to try and keep ... clients I have to try and keep clients from indulging their appetite for greed\nThey want that proverbial cake and eat it too they want both they want to see their accounts grow and they also want to have guaranteed income for life\nThere's some massaging there's some mastering that we can do when it comes to that but it's possible\nBut first and foremost when you come in and you sit across the table with us we want to hear your story what's important to you argue saving enough money on a yearly basis to even give you a chance of making it are you\n\nWe will help you understand that that's important to us it should be important\nTo you you know everybody\nShould be focused on the pile of money when they get to the top of the mountain how big\nBut then what happens to most people is there in there and then not figuring out that they can't live on assets they live on income\nThink about your ass as they can be lost they can be stolen they can be swindled sued divorce disseminated\nOr decimated [laughter] in a market crash they could be decimated in a market crash the ultimate success of your retirement is not about assets and that's reading right out of Tom Hanks misspoke don't worry retire happy it's about income and risk\nManagement folks you probably scratching your head because this is a huge paradigm shift for many people\nFor many people it's a huge paradigm shift and then they ask us which they should mark one should I be taking Social Security we will run for you that Social Security ... and report and that's part of the smart money master plan so we look at all of this\nThe ideal planned the ideal the perfect financial plan number one it should be simple it shouldn't be overly complicated you should be able to tell your spouse your kids\nYour siblings whoever is near and dear to you you should be able to tell them what your financial plan is\nAnd it could easily be just as easily saying look\nMy financial plant I've covered the five boroughs of life you could just simply say that look I've covered the five perils of life\nBut let's get a little bit deeper they want to go deeper they want to say look I've got Social Security covered I Know that should I pass away prematurely I've got to life insurance in my ... in place my wife is going to be", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "06"}
