an evolution it's great to be here with both of you again tell us let's sit on the minds of the retirees and the pre retirees that you've seen this past week\nOr something that come up a couple of times the way it's always interesting in that if power of attorney\nSo we never want to think about us not being here and we never won I think about not being able to make decisions for ourselves but the reality is we're all going to hit that point at some time in our lives and really making sure that you put some thought into what happens is what happens\nIf you get in a car wreck on the way home this afternoon who's going to step\nIn and make those decisions for you so I really think it's very important for people to make sure that they put those documents in place so that they get to speak for themselves when they can't speak for themselves\nGreat point that is so true\nYou know we're going to be talking about really key financial steps for people who are about ready to dive into retirement at all of this kind of goes along with it and you guys watch professional diverse before I Love watching them\nAnd every step they take prior to that dive is just as important as the dive itself right I mean those are all calculated and practice\nTo get it again and our topic today is going to be the key steps like I said that you need to take as you prepare to dive into retirement so we're going to try to walk through this tell us John where do you start with a client who come see you and says\nI really want to retire soon I Am ready to exit the rat\nRace of the workforce and I want to retire or what you say to them what do you walk them through\nWell along with your finances unique to mentally and emotionally prepared for retirement\nAnd it takes focus so a client that really needs to piece together what they want retirement to look like a day a week a month a year of retirement what that looks like are you having friends over for lunch are you going to the movies taking painting classes traveling\nMaybe it's all of the above what do you expect will be the new and what will be the same then how can you start preparing for that lifestyle now\nWhen someone has a feel for what they want their retirement to look like how do you help them prepare for that lifestyle\nWell it used to just taking the lifestyle for a tough spin for instance if you've always imagined owning an RV and retirement you know I eat driving around the country are you seeing the sights visiting friends and family considered doing that pre retirement taken extended RV trip did you enjoy it as much as you thought you would\nIf you didn't then maybe you should adjust your plan and rent an RV from time to time avoiding a big financial commitment\nThis RV part is really interesting because my father who lives here in Tucson and a ... my father and I are quite close one of the things is that one of his dreams for forever was that he was going to hop into an RV you travel around the country\nAnd he went through a housing change last summer and he had to spend just a month in an RV on a property not even traveling around in the RV but he had to spend a month in an RV and he\nQuickly quickly realized that that lifestyle was not for him\nYou know the food it wasn't even the travelling part but he's like she just couldn't stand the close proximity of what was happening inside the RV so all of a sudden this dream that he had for twenty Thirty years he touched drove it for one month and like\nOh I'm no good on what I Want\nThat is so funny he's like this is too tight quarters for me and I think it's\nThat way for any new hobby especially if it's going to require a huge financial investment and a big lifestyle change right oh yeah you get for healthy to have spent our two beforehand\nYou know I Want to jump in here too because this is the one of the most amazing things that I typically see that there are certain things that like crash retirements and I don't want to down on anybody's dream about\nYou how many folks that I worked with\nThat went out and bought that RV and those things are not cheap nothing wrong for people that are showing them I'm not again don't yet\nBut I'm saying you have to be ready for that commitment because it's a huge financial commitment and that is one of the ones that I've ... the ... you know bust up a good retirement plan if it's not very well thought out so I'm not against it right I don't want any or a repeat\nOf the opposite I'm just saying that if you're going to do that this is something you've got to be committed to ... I just think that's a that's a very interesting topic to broach the show\nSo understanding the cost them whatever that desire lifestyle may be make sure you're realistic about it that you can't afford it because for many of us our finances are going to be pretty fixed and retirement aren't they\nExactly which is why we like to put together a budget based on your retirement lifestyle vision what is that what are the non discretionary are fixed costs that you're expecting retirement\nThose are things like food housing healthcare those are things you're gonna have to pay for and then we want to put in some of the non essential your new hobbies right your new RV your new traveling extras like going out to eat seeing the grandkids things like that\nSo we work closely with our clients on all of this costs so they can get a better handle on those fixed in discretionary cough\nAnd so you know through resolutions I work with a lot of different women and all kinds of women we've got a huge variety of activities we like to do and lifestyles that we live but when I speak to the women I work with and we talk about but and\nAnd don't forget that required minimum distributions are are MDs that may be associated with some of your retirement accounts in particular the non\nRafael race generally speaking many financial experts recommend that you're guaranteed\nIncome should cover the book if not all of your essential living expenses it is really our belief that you're guaranteed income should cover all of your essential living expenses you don't want to depend on non guaranteed sources of income like income that's linked to the performance of\nPotentially volatile stock market\nTo have to cover all those fixed expenses you don't want your son chose exposed to the whims of the stock market\nSo if you're a tyrant is getting closer or let's say you've already retired how much should have invested in the stock market\nIt depends there's no one size fits all well most of us will still need the long term growth potential that equities provide your equities help our portfolios last as long as we do\nAnd they help combat inflation so most of us will still need equities but we also need to preserve capital so that balance of stocks bonds and everything in between is based on your risk reward profiled\nThis includes your time but wind and comfort level\nAnd John I've heard some say to capture your stock exposure roughly fifty percent going into retirement so that you can preserve that capital\nYou know that's kind of an interesting one that you these decisions depend on your overall portfolio\nAnd what other elements you have in place like emergency funds that can provide backup if and when we have market volatility occurs again it's one of those things that some say to cap stock exposure which is how you phrase that Karen but I think that it's important that you know every household once you're nearing retirement you want to know what you have\nSo I think that that statements kind of a little bit of a miss read\nAnd what I mean by that is as you're getting closer to retirement you want to know what you have to build off of and you don't want the exposure to the stock market to be very high within you know six months or year retirement but you could end up going back in equities once in retirement once you have a plan in place\nBut it's how we know what those totals are it's really hard to look at what one has to do there\nAnd I think when it comes to your retirement assets and how to maximize them to provide you with the income you need\nFor as long as you need it you don't know what you don't know it's John just said what you really deserve it's an objective viewpoint from someone who does this every day working with a retirement professionals who can provide you with a well thought out strategy\nThat's designed to help you manage your specific situation and maximize your retirement income\nSo when you call our office we're happy to set up a complementary appointment that are from you can talk to me or John or another member of our team where we can help you take a look at the big picture\nTalk to you about your needs your want your goals and then based on that conversation really be able to provide you with a retirement strategy that is developed on your individual circumstances if you want\nTo feel more confident about your income and your financial well being during retirement if you want to know that you're going to be OK in retirement don't pass this offer up today we're taking six people if you call five to zero three nine nine\nSix three for one and if you save two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement getting on his customized map this meaningful asset positioning\nYou can go in and visit with them about your retirement again just called this number we only have an appointment for six this week and they're busy schedule there that the telephone number is five to zero three nine nine six three for one again you're listening to retirement evolved with John ... and ...\nWhen they give you their website as well their website is rats Evo dot com you can find out more information they're R. E. T. E. V. O. L. dot com guys having a cash emergency find be a factor when it comes to determining how much time vested in the stock market\nWell the goal of having a cash emergency fund that it should allow you to avoid selling those investments that depressed ... gives you a chance to wait out that market volatility well still preserving that principle of your investments\nAnd doing this can help your portfolio last for the duration of your retirement well also help keep you out of debt in this way the half of your\nEmergency fund anywhere from three months to two years worth of expenses can influence how much stock should or shouldn't be in your portfolio overall also consider having a separate money market or savings account for bills especially monthly bills by knowing how much your annual expenses are\nHow much the guaranteed income won't typically cover you can strategically withdraw the necessary funds a deposit them into that money market this avoids market volatility or attempts to tighten the market as well as multiple transaction fees some people also recommend having two to three months worth of expenses set aside\nFor the very start of your retirement and case payments from pensions Social Security like or delayed for one reason or another\nNow if you need to access non guaranteed income sources in order to ... percent of your expenses is there some kind of a guideline for how much you can safely withdraw\nAgain it depends there is the fork for central but with people living longer and retirement and current low interest rate environment some experts are saying to lower that closer to three percent or even lower\nThis is with the general understanding that the portfolios well diversified and that checks and balances efforts are carried out on a regular basis\nYou know no income strategy should be on auto pilot because of market volatility inflation health issues those things may really require you to be flexible and to switch tactics\nBut that's why you have the diversified portfolio plus the understanding of your central cost so you have the options and how you cover them options that allow you to be tax efficient and can help you maximize the value of your retirement dollar saved\nNot can you explain how you guys would define a well diversified portfolio what is it that you look for\nWell in addition to having a mix of assets that align with your risk reward profile I like to see that meaningful amount of cash set aside and an acceptable emergency fine you know a pensioner four one K. maybe an annuity\nAs well as tactical investments in savings accounts and tax deferred and tax exempt accounts and obviously this depends on the individual and what they are comfortable with this account makes gives you different tax\nObligations which allows you to mix and match your withdrawal types for income tax efficient manner so if you need to withdraw income but are about to jump up to a higher tax bracket by doing so\nYou know having a qualified tax free withdrawals available through a raw or maybe an age of say to keep you from making that tax rate jumped this flexibility enables you to develop a sound withdrawal strategy one that keeps more of your money in your pocket while still giving you the income you need\nOn a side note here there maybe years in retirement where your federal tax rate is that the Fifteen Percent lower and you might want to take advantage of that bracket by strategically selling some of your long term investments that have accrued a sizable gained over the course at that um that's not\nSo why is that well because most people at the Fifteen Percent tax rate currently pay zero in long term capital gains tax us\nKnow I think that's important for our listeners on the radio there's lots of different facets to your retirement planning process\nBut we just talked about tax efficiencies which\nA lot of times aren't discussed in portfolio construction or aren't disgusted withdrawal strategies you know and that's one thing that's important about having a coach and retirement having someone to guide you along in the process the top athletes the top musicians tech the top politicians all have coaches people that helped them\nWalk through because they see this stuff every day and they helped kind of help them make the best decisions inside of their portfolio\nSo retirement evolution we always like to be kind of your quarterback in retirement because there's lots of different facets to look at there's your state planning we don't prepare state planning documents but we make sure that all the financials behind them and everything is constructed correctly and there's lots to\nYour state planning and getting those questions in having an advisor who used to discussing those things and making sure that everything's set up properly and working as a team member with your legal team there is also your income construction\nYou need a quarter back there to make sure that you're making the right decisions about making good income then the next thing that we have to look at it as your investments and you have to have good coaching on your investments to make sure that you're making the right choices and meeting your risk levels and meeting everything that you need in your retirement from an investment standpoint\nBut that doesn't stop there you still have to look at your taxes it's good to have someone again we don't prepare taxes that's what we again have strategic partnerships with tax professionals here in town but at the same point a lot of your investments can kick out taxation\nSo you need to have a good strategy between the quarterback and those other folks that we use from the tax side unless of course has health insurance planning\nAnd Karen or discuss that a lot with the folks we work with in our office from Medicare and also pre Medicare so under sixty five type coverage just what you need a quarterback and all those areas and what you don't want to do is have six quarterbacks and what I mean by that is six quarterbacks but no one's talking together so that is what we look at it in that process\nAnd so

he wanted to be able to offer them a broader range of solutions that's why he founded retirement evolution so they are here today Karen and John are here today because they want to help you\nUnderstand let's clarity where you're headed on your pathway to retire at we talked about retirement every single weekend today we're talking about Keith financial steps in case you're about ready to dive into retirement maybe you're already there\nAre I still do today John and cared are helping us still a little bit more confident by sharing these key financial steps one more important piece of their retirement puzzle that we have yet to talk about is health care and how to pay for this was a huge area John Karen which one wants to take\nThis [laughter] well that's always going to be me [laughter] so addressing how to\nPay for health care and retirement is crucial obviously we're hitting the Medicare annual enrollment period now\nAnd why is this so important well I think most of you probably know at least one person who's finance has been hit hard by the extensive cost of health event and as we get older these costs just go up and up and up\nAnd so when we look\nAt health care and retirement your first tactic is really to make sure you sign up for Medicare at the right time\nBecause Medicare is a program is really a pretty robust program and we'll cover a lot of routine health care costs\nOnce you turn sixty five but generally Medicare part a is looked at as the hospitals and insurance right of kind of cover expenses if we're admitted to a facility of some sort but you've got to be checked in\nHospitals skilled nursing hospice those types of things with original Medicare there's a deductible that you have to pay before original Medicare search pain and the Medicare part B is the place that most of us are going to use\nBecause that's what you're going to use when you're not checked into a facility which is hopefully the majority of your life so this we consider more medical insurance and it's going to cover all those outpatient services like doctors visits your test your lab work cancer screenings vaccines those types of things and everybody\nHas to pay a monthly premium for Medicare part B now open enrollment is going on right now doesn't care and it is so the annual enrollment periods start typed Tobar fifteenth and runs she'll December seventh and this was really a critical time of year because this is the one time of year that our listeners have to be able\nTo change their Medicare plans\nNow the other thing is this Medicare does not cover everything right it doesn't cover dental work or hearing aids which I Can't believe because my goodness people need a lot of that [laughter]\nIt's crazy you're absolutely correct we call him the big three there's no dental and vision or hearing benefit with original Medicare so this is why it can be a really good idea to sign up for some sort of supplemental insurance to expand the coverage than Medicare gives\nSo Medicare as a program actually offers some private insurance options and maybe your former employer has some insurance options to help fill in those gaps so we really want to take a look at all of those he says as you're approaching Medicare\nPerformance is not indicative of future results investments involved risk and unless otherwise state it or not guaranteed

portfolio you don't even know what's in it\nSo for retirement planning you want to have the right amount in your portfolio that has protected and safe and then the right amount that you can risk it's

willing to ride the ups and downs along the way\nThis is acceptable when you're still working and you're a ways off from retirement you're still buying and re investing along the way it goes over time history does show us that it will come back it might take time but eventually it'll come back\nBut what if you're close to retirement perhaps are already retired well the stock market and Wall Street is not where you want to rely one hundred percent of your money on\nWall Street just isn't in safety business they never have and never will be that's not what they do\nDid you know that so far in two thousand Eighteen and yes we are still on the tail end of a ten year bull market run the three biggest point drops in the history of the Dow Jones industrial average have all happened in two thousand and Eighteen\nVolatility is back in a big way so as you get older you probably start to look at risk and a little bit different way than you did when you were younger risk is now no longer just a bunch of numbers\nOr what kind of volatility you can bear but it's also a risk of your livelihood or your future livelihood your lifestyle\nThe money you've said in your four one K. or your IRA or in other savings accounts it's what you've been working on saving for your entire life\nYou don't want that to go away or have your four O. one K. turn into what they call sometimes a two oh one K. which happened right after two thousand and one when the stock market crash and in two thousand eight after the stock market crashed\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial we don't advised to our clients to rely one hundred percent on Wall street and that's where our safe\nNatural really shine we want a place a portion of your portfolio into safety and remove the downside risk completely for that part of your portfolio\nThe part that you need to protect and keep safe that part that you need to be there when you want it\nAnd then you can still have that part of your portfolio that you can afford to risk and for every person there is a different amount to having safety or in our safe money program and then the amount that you have at risk on Wall street\nWell for one a safe money portfolio cannot lose money to any stock market volatility that's right it can't lose money to the stock market\nSafe money also offers guaranteed growth options it has beneficiary transfer availability it can be held in an IRA or ... or even just regular saving money and if you're over fifty nine and a half and plan on still working\nMost four O. one K. is allow you to roll over your retirement money into a safe money IRA\nThe key of having safe money is that financial security that it can bring to your\nLike to compare safe money to stock market money or risk money because they're two separate things they're designed for two separate purposes and we're not trying to pit one against the other so to save money still offer growth absolutely yes it does well\nSafe money is no get rich quick schemes it does

money dot com were based right here in Tucson, Arizona\nNow yes don't get me wrong the stock market still is one of the most powerful tools available when it comes to growing your money there's absolutely no doubting that\nHowever that requires an ability for you to ride out the ups and downs that come with it because Wall Street is one of the absolute worst places to keep your money when you need to protect it which is usually about five years before and anytime after you retire\nYou see Wall Street isn't in the safety business they never were and they never will be when Wall Street rises and when it goes up that's what's called a bull market it's a stair step up at inches higher and higher and higher this\nCurrent bull market is now officially the longest in us history it's easy to get caught up in the excitement the game the trillion dollar market caps\nHowever just as bull markets climbed the stairs bear markets are when markets fall well they jumped out the window\nHistory has shown that time and time again it's easy to see this from past markets the crash in eighty seven the dot com bubble bursting in the two thousand one and two thousand to the financial meltdown of two thousand eight\nThese crashes happen quickly it's that bear market jumping out the window\nAnd when that bear market does come again and it will come someday believe you me are you prepared to see all these recent gains possibly disappear\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial safe money become so crucial to your financial security\nThe fact is and I've said this before on this radio program that if you're in your fifties and sixties right now you will most likely go through three to four more barrier markets in your lifetime so don't let that threaten your financial security\nI had a client in my office just the other day\nAnd his retirement was just around the corner litter\nAnd his four oh one K. he had saved and contributed and kept adding to it and getting his employer match and everything that can come with a four one K. if you're lucky enough to have one\nAnd in the past this client of mine had seen their fair share of ups and downs but now they were ready to move that part of their portfolio to safety\nNot to take them out of the game but to provide that financial security they needed because in the plan that we came up with here at Mayfield financial was that even if this market kept going up that's okay with my client they're safe money portfolio still going to grow gonna keep going up\nBut the main goal and the main purpose was to protect that part of his portfolio and their money\nSo it would not lose anything if this market were to take a tumble\nThat is the key to having peace of mind to having a worry free financial plan that is key to that

which is for your freedom I was at church the other day and and we were uh in between services and the one of the jet fighters flew overhead and you know when they fly overhead they make a lot of

he's right isn't it that's the sound of freedom well another sound a freedom as an organization called\nMedal of honor\nAnd you can go to their website medals of honor dot com I Believe it is trust and can you just triple quadruple confirm that\nUh and and the caption of their website says honor he'll connect\nThrough endurance sports and fitness it's a national awareness campaign to honor fall

general the United states he is like ten years of being the top CPA for the country each year refused to sign off\nOn on on the court on the national tax return and he says this is immoral this is this is incredulous that this is even happening\n\nSo bad so in twenty twenty six how can I say that we are in historically low tax rate because in twenty twenty six tax rates are going to go back up again to where they were in twenty Seventeen\nSo the power of zero this movie what we talk about what we are going to talk about on the today show and I'll tell you right now this was this was part it's got to be part one of at least part to coming up for next week\nIs that folks what are we going to do because the government desperately is going to desperately need money more revenue in the future and I contend that are going to need a lot\nMore so they aren't going to go after the people who have all the money they are they're going to transfer the money from those who have it to those who don't and the reason they're going to do that\nThis this is is because it's all about the votes\nSo I don't have the numbers in front of me but but the top one percent of the wage earners in America pay like fifty to sixty percent of the total income tax that's collected so they're going to continue to go after\nThose people because those people are the minority all the votes or with the people that aren't making all the money\nAnd when you think about Social Security Medicare Medicaid the an Affordable Care act not of affordable buddy an Affordable Care act where are they going to get the money\nThis is a conversation we are now having in our office with all of our clients if we are in historically low tax rates does it make sense\nS. E. N. C. E. R. S. E. N. S. E. march ... S. E. N. S. E. and does it make dollars and cents C. E. N. T. S. to pay the taxes they\nGet it over with and put it someplace where it will\nGrow and you can access it tax free and none of it shows up on your ten forty four\nWe have talked about this but very few people here as my contention\nVery few people think that what I'm Talking about today is going to happen they go you know what mark I haven't seen it we've been hearing about this the or the Congress keeps kicking the can down the road you know what this really isn't going to happen folks how much longer do you think\nWe can go on printing money\nIn golf they call it a mall again when you you take a shot and then you know hit it none of the rough hit in the water well we're going to give you a mole again we're going to allow you to take another shot at it well that's what really Trump has done by giving us these lower tax rates and postponing some of this stuff down the road until until maybe another\nGroup of people get in and they say we need to ... raise the rates again we need to really tighten our belts but you know what it's not polluted politically expedient for people to do this it doesn't gain them favor with with their constituency so what do you do as an individual well number one you're doing\nA really good thing today listening to the show number two you can pick up the phone and give us a call and say mark you've talked about this and ... what do I do we're going to get into the heart meat and potatoes of this thing here a little bit certainly in the\nSecond portion of our show give us a call two nine six four four six four go onto the Web\nAsked for the packet that\nWe've been given out for months and months and months because it's so important that it it contains all the information\nThat you want to know about\nIt all the different articles mark what's that that part that packet is called the optimize their packet I keep adding articles and articles more articles are going into it that support and substantiate where we are going as a nation\nWe are headed folks tours what's called a ... a sovereign debt crisis this fiscal gap\nIn and and I read this article and the gentleman is saying look we are headed towards insolvency ... is that not sobering or what if we are headed towards insolvency\nIt means to re boot we're gonna have to change everything that we do we're going to have to dramatically increased taxes that's why I say if you can pay\n\nI eat and then where do I put the money trust in where do people put the money if they pay the tax and they get it over with\nHe's thinking about their wallets\nAnd then what do they do with it what vehicle might they put in and take a really hard Dan Yan said this thing I'm going to go swim through life insurance area that that could be one of the vehicles or into a Roth IRA certainly anything where you can pay the tax get it over with and then all the gross that's that's in those vehicles is all yours\nIf you stop and you think about\nIs it possible that all going to go out on a limb here that it's it has been immoral for advisors to tell people to put money into four one K. plans and for all three B plans and IRAs and so forth why\nIs because it's not\nIt's a different role but really the word that makes the most sense is it is a postponement they are asking you to postpone paying the tax when you are in historically low rates\nTo a time when you are probably going to be in the highest tax bracket ever for you and your family does that make sense\nI had this conversation the other day and I can't even believe were\nLess than three minutes we got to take a a little break here in the show but think about a four one K. plant where the government is saying you can\nTake a deep Dutch and today on your contribution and oh by the way you're going to be taking on all the risk of that money market jumps market ... you know plummets you're going to yes you get the game but you also but there's little catty out to that but you're also going to take me taking on all the risk if that market plummets\nYou the listener the one that has that for one that for all three be that simple IRA that set plan you're taking on all the risk but then when you get out to retirement look at all the potential growth fats in that account the government is saying\nThank you for taking on all that risk but now we want to share and all that\nGain folks is that fair you've taken on all the risk now they're asking you to share in\nWhat you did that roller coaster ride and hopefully that account as gain some money they're now saying they want to participate in that\nIs that fair I don't think it is so let's step back what have you paid a taxi\nYou got it over with you said look mark I agree I I Believe what you're saying is true I Am going to take that money today pay the tax on it and I'm going to put it into something like a whole life insurance policy or I'm going to put it into a Roth or some type\nAnd then all of that game all of that\nIs yours none of that declare rubble\nThere is no longer a postponement you've taken on that risk today by paying the tax which there's very little risk if we are technically in a in a bracket that it's going to be the lowest of your lifetime but all of that gain all that growth the government is not going to participate in\nIts all yours ooh let's rub our hands together yeah it's all mine it's all mine look at what exactly see that's what the government hasn't told you it's a postponement\nAnd they are having you postpone that money to a point in time where they're going to need it desperately probably the most desperate they've ever been because of where we're going this thing we call a fiscal cliff folks it's common you know the biggest threat to our national security\nIs not the borders it's our national debt I think about that for a second the biggest threat to our national security\nThat's not sobering if that doesn't so real if you're not thinking oh my goodness mark\nWhat do I do well you call us let us help you get on the right track two nine six four four six for my cell two three five nine for six five trips and I can't believe the first portion of the show is over you didn't want to stay tuned for the next portion of our show because this is where we really dialing out what you can do because the math done\nWhat do you think about it [noise] life is all about the choices we make there are the button Joyce's like should I ordered the\nLet's do this let's do that well look folks the current budget of the U.S government is currently around four point two trillion dollars that's the current budget so what's the deficit\nThe deficit is we're not bringing we're bringing in a million less than a trillion I'm Sorry we are bringing in a trillion less than that\nMedicare for all would be estimate is it costs three point six trillion dollars you know a little bad here a little ... you know a billion here a billionaire a trillion here now you're starting to argue starting to talk about some real money\nIf you throw in Social Security defense interest on the dead and pensions at all levels of government the cost is now over ten trillion dollars\nAnd if all of our country is only twenty trillion mathematically all the numbers I just read would destroy\nOur economy so what does all this what does this mean for you the individual if all those numbers are just like gobbledygook and you're thinking what in the world is this even\nMean it means let's talk about you and your family what can we do to help you and\nYour family I Would like to say here's a solution to the economy to our country as a whole that would mean probably getting rid of all of Congress and getting economists in there who really know what's going on we know that's not going to happen so what can you do here in Tucson\nArizona in southern Arizona what can you can pick up the phone you can cause you say mark you're talking a lot about this stuff what can I conceivably\nDo today ... is it and we're going to talk about this I Hope today can I even take advantage of bad stuff when that happens when the markets plummet\nYes you can take advantage of that ... what we can talk about this maybe not today I'm going to maybe touched on it but definitely next week\nSo folks the Social Security Medicare programs are currently running negative cash flow numbers that means that we are paying out more benefits than they are receiving in revenue\nYou know we've heard this time and time again the problem is everybody is super busy we are all running at a million miles an hour we get our information in Fifteen second news bites right little things here a little things there we don't hear the whole story we're going well that\nAll wow that look at look at the market's up to look at how folks as Paul Harvey used to say don't you want to know the rest of the story don't\nYou really want to know what's going on if today at the end of the day show you simply remember what mark said about ... ...\nLow tax rates historically low tax rates maybe I Need to start thinking about paying the tax today\nAnd putting time on your side folks Tyne is not on your side when you are postponing a tax liability that's on the side of the government that's not on your side\nYet most of us unfortunately have bought off hook line and sinker into\nPutting money into for a one case for all three bees\nTraditional i._r._a. set simple we have been taught that\nBy Wall Street our government has said hey we will give you a deep Dutch in today and you can differ that no you can't postpone\nWhat is inevitable\nIt's inevitable that you're going I Believe it's inevitable you're going to be at a higher tax rate when you get into retirement do you want to even take that chance I Would think I Would hope you would say no\nSo as I said earlier I Believe it's even deceptive for many advisors and look if I have somebody comes in and they are adamant about the mark\nI Want to set up a for one I Want to set up an IRA look I'm not going to argue with him but I give them the hard and cold fact so where do you put the money first and imagine if you pay the tax today where can you put the money to wear all grows free of income tax\nDown the road think about it just really hard for a second I you're smiling so I kinda think you kinda sorta\nNo take a look at the ... you're shaking your head say have you not been listening to the show every week that I did that I Do it or do you avoid actress and come on now work with me here got to be in some sort of policy\nWhat do you mean you don't know man you ride again a life insurance policy that's where you should be putting it why because of all the advantages look\nIdle folks I don't want you to die that's not why we're buying this thing we want you to live we want you to enjoy all the living benefits I had a a good outcome in a last week\nAnd she was she was very concerned about some monies that she had bean a creditor and predator\nProtected who isn't that interesting you liked that creditor imprinted are protected that's what life insurance has the cash value is any good whole life insurance policy or creditor and predator\nProtected\nThey help you when it comes to long term care they help you when it comes to critical illness they help you when it comes to maybe having to pull somebody out to keep your business afloat or to pay that bill that unexpected medical bill where is the money going to come from\nYour life insurance policy and again\nWhen the real crash finally hits and I believe that's coming I Believe this soon nominee is coming and think about it when when the crash finally hits and everybody wants to get out of all their stocks and bonds and their mutual funds and their ... and real estate and all their commodities\nWhere we'll where will they get the money for the ... redemption Z\nWherever this money is held where are those folks going to get the money who's going to buy all of these assets when everybody wants to sell them\nThere's not necessarily going to be a market for them life insurance on the other end has always been liquid during all the economic disasters that have ever been around\nI think about that\nYou the listener have inability to take advantage of opportunities I said this a minute ago and here I'm getting right to it to take advantage of economic disasters\n\nFolks please listen here in a society where everyone is always soon everyone think about that eat right everybody wants to sue for this for that everybody's a victim\nDo you believe it should be some of your assets should be protected against this sort of attack\nI Believe they should be so life insurance is not just all about you dying and you leaving tax free dollars to somebody that helps out a lot to the survivors and we can give you first hand stories and accounts of people who have really benefited from\nReceiving tax free life insurance dollars but let's talk about you living\nLet's talk about you\nTaking a portion of those funds and when the markets have sunk to all time low as you get back into mark is that possible yes\nSo here's some questions are going to go kind of jump around a little bit here but here's some questions because it's we believe it more financial strategies and you can\nA call if this is resonating with you'd only Mark I'm never hurts somebody talk on the radio like this before\nWill come into the office in the conversation will continue will will pick right up where we've left off here on the radio [noise] give us a call two nine six four four six four to nine six four four six four call me on my cell\nTwo three five nine for six five so here are the questions are you aware of all the challenges that you the listener are about to face financially and in your retirement lie so all the things we just have the new Murray that over the last\nForty minutes all the things we're talking about Medicare Medicaid Social security increasing tax rates the stock market\nOf all those challenges aware of them you can't be aware of if you're basing decisions on Fifteen second soundbites that you're hearing over the TV or over the airwaves we will have a real conversation with you about these issues\nA real conversation and what does that mean you're going to spend at least a couple of hours talking with us about the stuff that matters to you the most and how do we position and this is all about positioning for what we think is inevitable stuff is going to hit the fan\nAre you going to repair be prepared when it does so number one are you aware of all the challenges that you're about to face are you are you really aware of those we are and we want to discuss those with you it's not just the answers that we give\nBut it's the answers to the questions that we ask that you give to us that help you form and formulate a plan number two what if it was possible\nI think about what if it was possible to develop a strategy that would prevent you from being heard from any of the things I just mentioned\nWhat if it was possible for you not to be hurt by the next crash that comes\nWhat if it was possible you to be hurt when taxes to not be her when they eventually raised taxes or they cut Social Security benefits or do they cut Medicare or Medicaid benefits\nOr they put the kibosh on capital gains or whatever what if it was possible for you to develop a strategy that would prevent you from being heard from any of those things I just mentioned would you want to talk to us about it", "show_name":
