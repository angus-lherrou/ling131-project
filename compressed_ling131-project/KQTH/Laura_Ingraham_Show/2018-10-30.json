just how ...\nYour mid term election destination station in one of them were one kid you know the dog\nI'm fine and yourself better than I deserve what's up\nWell the reason I'm calling today to talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm\nA hundred thousand of student loans and the balance will be a credit card debt we recently met with a financial adviser and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because it would take a long time to pay off bad bet they suggested that\nSaying that it will be better for us to just start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion\nWhat is your household income sure\nOh combined it's about eighty five okay you have any car debt ... mhm oh no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth oh\nI Would say about twenty thousand combined\nOkay All right well\nHere's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor didn't know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nHere we did talk about that during the conversation\nThat's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd because the ... the hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless if it's not all bankrupt ... so we're dealing with you're going to file bankruptcy I'm thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year\nYeah one year live on fifty pay it off in one year take six extra jobs sell so much stuff you can't breeze no eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year what are your car's worth\nYeah of course the worthwhile corner OK each\nUm heard of a new or my over oh they're so\nProud of ours are working are hers is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine of about ...\nMhm okay well um you can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy 'cause you're two dead young lazy to address the situation let's even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year\nAnd your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt to be going in one year\nSo how fast do normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\nAbout four years yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and um you know I I Would not move down in car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living through the past the okay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nUm you know she knows ... gun or does she do speaking Miami does she speak on Sunday mornings\nYes he does very creative thunder okay All right I mean I Wonder if if you know she might feel do some ... occasionally for somebody\nThat was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works in an evangelist to outrage and they pay you are a little bit for speaking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you had ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget to nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing and for years maybe three but four for sure\nUh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry though that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you've got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you've got to stop living the way you've been living goes is not working agreed\nOn the staff does that make sense yes I like that yeah\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant\nAt the time\nIt yields a harvest of righteousness\nBible says that no discipline seems pleasant\nAt the time but it yields a harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people\nYou're not ... you're not dumb you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it as I did a lot of dumb things in my life dude I'm with money in particular has high end up teaching is because I got a PHD in the UN be\nBut um you know if I don't I don't know who it was they gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nBecause they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you could not only can work through this I think you should work through this\nI think it'll be a testimony to God's power in your own life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack at an attack in and that you can start having a sense of self control the sense of discipline and it'll change your marriage on communication levels in lower the stress when you're working the plan they gather\nIn you can do anything how old are you guys\nA cute twenty eight I'm I just turned thirty two\nExcellent show when you're thirty six and she's thirty two year debt free how's that field\nAre you ... you know life no vacation with no eating out for a short period of time for a short period of time you live like no one else\nShow that later you can live and give like no one else I think about what how much how much money you would have and how well the you could become and how generous you could be if you didn't have any payments right now\nOh my gosh\nI think about the peace that would be in your house the stress that would be gone say it's worth it to pay a price to win but there's a price to be paid do as a prize to be fat you got your own home\nAnd you don't get out of a whole by jumping out usually you climb out scratching and clawing pulled and dirt under your fingernails you know what I'm saying you can do this map I'll help you I'll help you don't want you to go through our non white class on how to handle money and I'm going to pay for it\nIt's called financial peace university you hold on and all have Kelly pick up and we'll get you and your your wife

no taxes in good growth stock mutual funds\nThat will cause you to make more money monthly than the monthly annuity check would have been because it is based on a lower rate of return in the mutual fund should perform at and when\nYou die with a pinch and the money's gone when it goes to pinch in heaven\nNot the your heirs go when you roll or\nTake the lump sum and you roll it over and an Iranian I still there and when you die goes to your heirs\nOf the you make a higher rate of return while you're alive and one hundred percent higher rate of return [noise] as I keep the money not raise they'll they're so you're saying [noise] always some rollovers\nMutual funds direct transfer [noise] good IRA so that with Michel so that [noise]\nGood mutual funds direct transfer [noise] good IRA so that with mutual fund so that is actually [noise]\n\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nYou know ... and we do need to go crazy on kids cars here ... ... is the thing is I don't want you to move down and\nRelax the pressure to figure out is there a way to get the income backup I Want you to look down and keep the pressure on is their way to get the income back up just for the fun of it because you know what are you and a half million ensure fun to make it again\nExactly in the house\nDid you get the income back up just for the fun of it because you know ... million ensure fun to make it again\nExactly in the house we're moving into to me is not step down the beautiful house that I mean it it's a house that everyone would love to live and it's you know I'm not going to be able to see the sun come up with the Atlantic every morning but I can live without that\nYeah ... ... and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we've got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna as we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are for the next two years or whatever it takes to turn it around absolutely I make this move\nDefinitely make that move it all sounds very logical to me good question I ride Derek with us in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey how's it going his honor to talk to you to have you too sir how can I help\nYeah you're while you're told them I make over book or just changed our lives I got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gift we implemented it and pay off twenty two thousand dollars a day ... months and then that bin ... free sense so it's been awesome good um my question to you\nNeed your help with this because sometimes I feel like I'm controlled by fear and over stinking when do you quit your day job which is good to go fulltime entrepreneur\nDo you have the full time job or do you have the entrepreneur gig running\n[noise] yeah that's what my wife does she sells the clothing for that movie um [noise] and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when that time is to leave that retirement benefits the security\nYou wouldn't believe it was her the mechanics thing to sell women's clothing [noise] yes [noise] ... are you already involved in the business\nYes she's been selling it for a year and a half um\nShe's ... she she makes in one week would I make a gross in a month as a mechanic mhm um so I wouldn't be going fulltime helping her with in voicing and shipping in the back office stuff while she sells all the dresses skirts\nMhm okay and and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can't hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back office shipping stuff\nWould that be the the best route to go as well at least ten okay you walk away from fifty in order to do a job you could have hired somebody for twenty to\nDo that ... short\nWell she she gross is she is gross two hundred and ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what she grosses okay unless you're going to add more to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now then it's not making sense okay\n'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't at three hundred and ten\nNo yeah\nShe's got costs of goods sold out of that that's not profit we're talking about there yeah ... is a is around a hundred thousand out of that she's going to have taxable income of a hundred K. and she needs somebody\nBut we're talking about there yeah ... is a is around a hundred thousand out of that\nShe's going to have taxable income of a hundred gay and she needs somebody to do are shipping\nShe needed a lot of help she's we're working two full time jobs that were working from eight AM to an eleven twelve sometimes mhm okay\nSo the question then becomes what are you going to add not can you quit okay so it's just a business perspective on because the other thing to scare me here is if if this thing a ... out on you\nThen you're both out of work if you quit yes if it flamed out on you if the fad the ashes on this particular clothing line five years from today is this thing still operating this multi level deal right\nAh well I guess you'd call multi level\nMarketing and I would call him on network marketing thing your recruiting people\nKnow that that's the misnomer a that's a misconception of ... I buy wholesale financial retail just like a discount tire store buys Michelin inner Cooper Tires I you don't like All right I well you don't recruit people\nBuy you can but yeah you can also okay\nUm no I I Would hire somebody to do the shipping\nAnd then when it gets so big\nAnd you're making so much money [noise]\nYou're feeling the money and you want with then that's fine but right now I think you're caught\nThis is that Iran\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die and that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to Zander insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and\nSee how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible it really does make you

U. T. H. dot com sponsored by the floods moving and storage catch\n\nLater on\nAnd\nWith us from Springfield, Missouri\nThey just have to and\nFor the last five years we have been building our home\nPaycheck to paycheck and\nUm it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it a kind of get things rolling a little bit\nBut um we got an offer to do a care taking position and the guy is on a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live\nUm [noise] do we sell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue make a payment on it\nIt's not completed\nWell it [noise] we're at a point it needs a paint and flooring\nAnd you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home um\nBut then we got this offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got that are okay so that's so that so you've never lived in this other house no okay somebody will tough to sell it and the conditions than yeah like they can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping\nA what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar\nYeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [laughter]\n\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband's the only one working well we have a business um that doesn't mean that I can running but it doesn't make money\nHis income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly\nOkay [noise]\nAnd then during the care taking condition or will be making about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got that bar until you get until he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore that's right so I mean you could walk into more on fire you\nPretty much\nI've changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right right so um\nYou have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand it's not completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um\nBecause ... it's a further discount than the cost it takes to complete it\nIt's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers house okay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that I'm a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking\nSo um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far uh\n[noise] the house itself we owe thirty thousand but there are some property attached to it so all the guests\nAh [noise] about how the south we owe thirty thousand but there are some property attached to a jail altogether it a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well\nYes\nOkay All right yeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd under continued fighting money ... yeah\nYeah we all have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're gonna get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it is it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need luggage or incomes\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and you know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get his sold as fast as possible now is the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land\nWithout selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\nCelebrate selling acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved Olivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nGoing to hire you better than I deserve what's up\nAnd I had a question and I had an African amount of debt and and I'm wanting to pay that off the air that right [noise]\nAnd then in recovery for an addiction and an idea that it's going to therapy so [noise] and I use your regular and complaining she cut budget and pet therapy at the end it likely not going to get paid and how kind of\nHard to quit that I'm not really sure way to put it in the budget or how big of a priority like\nHow long you been clean and have any\nGood for you well then what is it\nAccurate diction and what are you\nOkay All right well no I'm not going to therapy on hold right now this is something you need you need some accounts for a walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life would you agree with that statement yeah\nNow what I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation\nUm the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise therapist is not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income\nAnd you're out go you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing\nYou're going to feel more energized to make more income\nAnd so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt but you pay your therapy good\nAnd I feel more energized to make more income and so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt but you pay your therapy\nGood if next month the same thing happens okay but by this time next year we ought to be making more money\nRight let's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to ... for today Seventy five whole days you been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start right but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise]\nSo let's get Hugh healed and then let's see all your money\nAnd as you go and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips and you go OK I'm OK not getting the money no it's not all or nothing it's coming gradual it'll be incremental\nYou'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or your four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more than make Moran save more and more and\nYou know you you all have more focused on the money 'cause you'll be more he you'll have to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right mhm yeah [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner you're finished turned the corner and let's let's going out and then\nAs you make incremental progress move more and more than money from your new income and your increased income to\nThe debt shot for today we want to take care of Libya you need to be taken care of\nAnd you're doing a good job yourself out of this or whatever I'm show\n\n\n\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often or you're stressed about bill's afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nUm and those are you know that those things that we really thought it was sort of a ... opening things up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing us through what was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church\nAnd we're just getting to the part where we're ah we're working on wheels and so because we have this special needs a issue we were you involved or attorney in getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we uh you know I'm\nA we've been discussing a special needs ... well that has to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your animal ... sure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of functions the same way with the other boys have a college fund and baby step five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition who special rules because of course\nUh you know his his features are boring sport too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to ah [noise] ah you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as we're as I'm getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet but it's coming down to the wire one of the things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money are fun to try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust the ... the inability to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded proud of your dad okay so that it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nAnd it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to ... as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nThat flew out of those assets now they don't win the trust is needed is if both of you die\nWhen the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that drought that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy and the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing where the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go\nInto the special needs trust perpetually care for this other child throughout life not just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds okay your other children are grown and gone are close Twenty years from now right that's the dream yet the dream that's all yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter]\nThat's the legacy by [laughter] but it's out of that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars and in my example is gonna be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife were to pass the rest of it would go to your\n... more traditional airs directly\nTo her but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child ... special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's eighty thousand dollars a year it'll produce ... that'll take care of him and may be one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy then you\nKnow what you would you go ahead like we're doing right now would you formula trust as illegal activity no now and we've been unfunded or would not let it they would make it a caught in in the ...\nI Would just make it a clause in the will to be formed upon both of your deaths\nOkay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing you don't need to ... earn more than all the time you don't need to go to all the legal expense to form the trust so let me give you another example okay special needs for us as a as a special conditional\nVersion of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual okay but you know my children grew up and moved out on her own their own so my need for a trust to cover my minor children\nIn a in a live in both of our best expires\nAt I formed a trust them my minor children at that time in the need for that expire\nAnd I would have done it for nothing in this case is not going to be ... you're going to need a trust fund that but I wouldn't be doing it until you die mess when you have a family on death in the ... that's what I Would do whatever you want and that's that's how we do thanks for the call\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills and take care of yourself and your family if something\nCivility insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills and take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families\nStay away from cash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures that's why I send you to Zander insurance\nThey've been helping my listeners
