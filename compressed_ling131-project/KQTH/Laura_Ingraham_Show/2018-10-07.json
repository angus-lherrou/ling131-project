L. C. N. S. A. C. registered investment advisor insurance and annuity products are sold several a through premier retirement planning and wealth management\n[noise] here's one thing to retire and it's another just stay retired gets your money would just\nThe what do you prefer mere retirement planning and wealth management starts now [noise]\nWe've all heard about the ten commandments they're\nGood ideas to make your life better\nHappier live your life happier and more productive what about retirement or their Ten Commandments that will help you live your retirement or your ideal retirement life better we think there are there the core principles retirement we can also call them the ten commandments retirement that's what we're going to cover today on ditch your money\nI'm Jeff voting your host president a premier retirement planning of wealth management with my co host of Linda what are you good morning\nHey good morning ... a weekend happy weekend man happens very long week long are you going to tell everybody where we have tobacco and as I said it may have a great bus tickets all 'em out to have a four week for some are an hour and a again\nAnd we actually tried not to talk about business for a while we'd been we\nUm the fact that we didn't have Internet kind of help that\nWell yeah some of us did but anyway it was a it was a good time we're back into ready to hit the ground running with the ten commandments\nCore principles of retirement now you know the to take the ten commandments are mostly if you think about um they're the ... not ... not this not don't kill don't committed guidelines ... whatever but there's also a few thou shalt like honor they father you know and the mother and you know um\nHave no other ... you know put God first and there's a lot of things that we got to put first when it comes to retirement as well like how 'bout now shall not run out of money [laughter] that's a good one and how about the Dow shout now shall enjoy your retirement by planning in advance rather than\nA Bob and weave in ... acting wants to retirement plan starts so\nAnd no matter what you call them they're important is your ideal life or to craft your ideal life or in retirement\nAnd and again you know without knowing these command Mr knowing the core principles in advance is kind of hard to plan planning is a well it's a pre event\nA process is not a oh hey I just bumped up against is a challenge now what do I do that is a reactive way to planet unfortunately so many people get to retirement they think they\nYou know get to that ripe old age of sixty five or sixty six when you can start taking getting your Medicare insurance covered and then you can get your Social Security turned on and uh you might get a pension or you might just happen to see how much is in the four oh one K. whether you hit that magic number that you've been looking for not all of a sudden now it's like OK I'm here now what I'm\nPlanning for most part we as human beings we don't like to plan and it can be very tedious at times so we like you just get in and do it\nRight and I think what people do when they don't plan as they come up to that point where all of a sudden now we've got this uh position and we and we see this all the time in our office people come in and say oh here's my plan tell me how much I can live on and that kind of goes with the first core principle is\nHave an idea of what you want to live on in retirement if you're used to living on let's just use around number let's say a hundred thousand dollars a year because that's what you're making in\nYour working life and if you're spending all but maybe\nA certain percentage of that because you're putting some away are paying taxes that you might not have to pay later or that you're gonna have I mean isn't that still the same lifestyle that you'd want to continue living a retirement why do planners are some people some companies retirement plan and companies say well you should plan to live on Seventy percent of whatever you're living on now during your working life\nHad that why you're a kid and plan to maintain your lifestyle\nWhy not live on a hundred percent of it or in some cases it's kind of an irrelevant number because for some people if they're barely eking by they can't live on even Ninety nine percent\nAnd then there's other people that are making a ton of money way more than they need well I mean what's relative to a ton of money at a relative of course I buy like let's just say they make twice what they need to live on well they can maybe live on fifty percent but if they what you need to find out is what you're living on and you want to create the lifestyle if you can to maintain that lifestyle in fact\nSome people want to increase it a little bit and so don't plan I think that one of the biggest thou shalt is to determine what is going to cost to live that ideal retirement life\nWell at least an entire to maintain what you're used to now granted but that being said\nSpending habits when you have that income coming in spending habits can be very difficult to change so making sure that you know what your budget is going to be in retirement versus\nUm what it is when you're working and some of the the research that we've done show that some people spend a little bit more like you said some people spend a little bit less\nBut one of the um study shows that when you first get into retirement you are going to spend a little bit more money on travel\nHealth care pre retirement about eight percent of your budget after retirement about Nineteen percent utilities is one that I kind of shocked me that utilities are going to go out yeah you stay home or staying home or especially Arizona when are you doing you're cranking that air conditioned\nOut for those eight hours you used to be working here at home so yeah there's a lot of expenses that actually do go I mean those are the necessities that actually do go up in retirement when\nMarket controlled up and down with the market while you're waiting for probate to release it to you for how many years I mean I was waiting for years on some cases so again you don't want to have your money out of your control so you want to set it up to where those accounts or in your control\nBut I like and you know since I've had to deal with medical issues and I like having my team all underneath one with when I went and my cancer instead of when I first started I had it at GI guy over here I had my surging I've been there I had my medical on colleges to over there\nWhen I finally found a place that they all talk together they all sat around a table than my health was better served my life is better served by having it all underneath one move and everybody talking together\n... exactly and that's and that's how I think it should work especially with the estate by now if they plan can be ugly um there's a lot of assets that are really easy to pass without probate ... those are the things that you can put a direct successor or a beneficiary on\nAnd the cool thing now some people think that the the difference between an estate planning whether you have a we'll which by the way it goes through probate don't let your lawyer make it think that because they do a will for you you don't have to go through probate it just means that the lawyer who drafted it for you probably is going to get a call when you die and they're going to deal with appropriate process for you\nAnd of course we know and not to be smart the legal profession they do a good job in what they do but remember they do work by the hour not by how fast they can get a job done and sometimes I don't think there's a real incentive to get this thing done they want to be thorough and those hours out up at hundreds of dollars per hour\nAnd that's why probate can be very costly time consuming and frustrating for many families you can also use a trust a living trust will get you out of that probate process\nIs just like putting all your assets into an entity and when you die your trust just gets a new trust your new boss and so your stuff just becomes managed by a new\nManager so that's an easy way to bypass probate but but it doesn't cost a little bit of money is set up and there is a management issues but there are simpler ways and even that to do it\nRight and yeah there are some financial instruments out there like annuities and life insurance that those amyloid probate they go directly to the beneficiary\nAs long as you have a name to beneficiary that is illegal entity like a person an individual or an entity some I I've seen some insurance policies people will come in and say the ... and I'll see the beneficiary doesn't nation as as a state of if you're beneficiary says anything like a state of\nYou are going through part of it because it because that has to be proved who you're a state is\nThe other thing that you can do is direct succession not just on those particular products but keep in mind IRAs Roth IRAs also have been a fishery designations where you can designate a spouse in than children to receive it directly without probate and in Arizona and a few other states they now have\nWhat's called a beneficiary deed where you can actually put property you're home\nA real estate on a beneficiary de that shows that as soon as whoever's named on that Dede can produce a death certificate and your name in other words you're gone they now own that property it can be put in their name they don't control of it [noise] so there are direct succession plans that you can use in conjunction with\nYour financial plan and most of the time unfortunately when you go to the big box brokerage houses and things they go oh we don't do estate planning you know go to somebody else will ... where do you go if you don't know these things [laughter] so send us that's what I was yeah\nAnd that is non financial decisions can and will affect your financial decision and sometimes that doesn't seem like it would that are you going to move by you're going to travel um are you going to be at taking the grandchild all in those had impacts and when you're making non financial decisions\nI think one step further on how that can impact your financial situation taking in a kid can cost be very costly\n... well it is and we've had that happen and that's just one example of many but I just keep 'em on ... to ... or just to to reiterate that in in a simply is\nYour ideal retirement life is your life is not just your ideal retirement portfolio that's not worth ... earlier\nThan the ideal retirement life starts with a plan it starts with an assessment to see if you're ready to start to assess went to see what goals you have starts assessment see what your family situation is what you what goes on I had a generations or might come up with\nIf you're ready for that retirement readiness review we love to have you in

retired or planning to retire Jeff ... window whether you're familiar return of venting their wealth management will help you maximize your income minimize your taxes ... protect what you have more a lifetime to achieve now back to his your money [noise]\n\nPage at that time again for your kid that we [noise] yes it is and the tip of the week this time is going to be out\nAbout all the R. M. D. mistakes you need to avoid our MDs are called ... choir minimum distributions\nThey apply to your qualified accounts when the IRS forces you to take money out of those IRA accounts or those retirement accounts at the ripe old age of seven and a half now that's not always the case but it's just kind of assumed that case\nI'm going to go through some of the um I guess the misconceptions and the mystery behind our MDs and some of the mistakes that you might want to avoid so\nPay attention here and get some good\nGet some good scoop All right so what about taking your are MDs at the wrong time\nI'm the first time you were required to take a minimum distribution from a qualified account or a a a an IRA let's just say four one K. is at age seven and a half and that assumes you're not working if you're still working you can actually keep their four O. one K. money are working for you and not have to take that are empty but if it's in an IRA\nYou have to take out slightly under four percent of that money at age Seventy half now the first time you've taken are empty out you don't have to take it out the year you turned Seventy and a half you have to take it out by April\nFifteenth the the the time you file for your taxes after that year and some people think oh great I'm not going to take that money out now I'm going to wait 'til April well guess what you just did you just forced herself to take out to our MDs and the same tax year that may in fact force you into a higher tax bracket\nUm or at least keep that second are empty out that higher tax bracket when in fact if you split those are MDs up and took him in the correct year then\nMaybe you would have maintained a little low\nOn on those requirement and distribution so be sure you do the math before you just assume that a smart to put off paying taxes I noticed the pay a lot of time says hey we'll put up paying taxes because it makes them look good that you're that they file your taxes but they're not going to look good in the future if you end up having a double dip on those are MDs or next year\nNow on the contrary if you know that you could be in the same tax bracket whether you take that are him deep\nOr not if it doesn't make a difference then maybe there is no problem in waiting but make sure you know what the cost is going to be before you make that decision\nSo I'm not realizing the extra costs of delaying that first are MD is probably going to be you know top of the list when you first start here's another problem with our MDs if you take it at the wrong time or you forget to take it or you don't take it\nThe penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution or\nThe proper amount of distribution is a fifty percent tax penalty now I've heard on another talk radio show somebody says is it true you have to take a fifty percent penalty and this is a well known financial guru says no that can't be true it could never do it is true I hate to tell you [noise]\nUnbeknownst to even other financial professionals you might hear on the radio that penalty can be stiff [noise]\nNow the other thing about our um the withdrawals is the amount based is based on your total\nQualified accounts or the total amounts that you have an all your accounts but it does not require you to take the are empty from each specific account and eat in the same proportion\nYou can actually take all of your are MDs out of one account as long as the total amount of our um the withdrawals and the amount you pay on those withdrawals is the right amount to cover all of those retirement accounts\nNow you can't now they you you can't mix and match between spouses they have to be your own for your own IRAs and so you but if you have several different IRA account you can uh um [noise] just find that the total amount you have to pay now the amount you have to pay is also based on December thirty first value of those\nQualified accounts\nAs of December thirty first the prior year and you have to take the required minimum distribution out by December thirty first the following year so you may actually be able to allow that account to grow for a year and be able to have some gross and then take the required minimum distribution out later\nWhich you know me at least keep that money working for you so some people try to take that are empty out at January one because you have to take it out but you don't get the advantage of continued taxed for all that you you know can can roll up into your account [noise]\nSo what about some number seven and that is the ... are we done with them or six\nI think we're done more good than what I mean if we can talk about annuities and all of that other stuff but that's another show but\nYeah we have we done that before I mean to create income is a reliability of income can be your Social Security or pensions a guaranteed annuities or even the ... life insurance retirement plans have guarantees of income guarantees as well so there are ways to guarantee and get your income level up to whatever it needs to be and then well of course a lot of that depends on your savings and whether or not you're responsible and\nI won't call lucky I think it's really just that you plan to well that you work hard planned well live within your means you'll be able to continue that retirement so\nShould you continue to save and retirement is that another ... ...\nIs an ... you had that opportunity and if you are living below what you're making in all of your retirement accounts and definitely I Would say starting another account that's there for emergencies are just so that you can keep up with your ... well\nI think a lot of times we we think there might we kind of plan for inflation I think the um\n[noise] uh the inflation will probably be offset by us as we get older spending a little bit less nevertheless some of the costs that happened when we're older are can be extreme like the nursing homes like the uh um care that might not be covered\nThe experimental care that might not be covered with your Medicare plan you may have to go to Mayo Clinic for what's called experimental treatments which are covered you may need a chunk of money set aside for that big rainy day expense and it isn't if you don't need every penny to live on it's a it's smart to try to save and maybe even accumulate a little bit for the future if you can have\nIt in a savings account or leverage it to make more money so am I life insurance\nLooks like we covered ah three more we've got three more to go on the commandments let's talk about those our last segment but before we go let's uh I'm\nReminded if you want to retirement radius review to see if you've got those five points taken care of adequately that they dumped tail together that that comprehensive plan is in place and that you have the capacity to retire if you're planning on retiring soon\nOr the next five or ten years even as better to start early than to start late and if you're already retired uh let's make sure that we don't have any gaps and that we can help you feel those gaps if need be\nCalled five to oh to one

R. M. D. distributions that's probably the biggest area that you can tackle now if you are retired and waiting for that dreadful day when you have to take that are empty at Seventy and\nI have most people don't realize they had that seven that Seventy and a half issue for the required minimum distributions\nAnd a lot of people are so excited that they've got six hundred seven hundred thousand dollars in taxes however that many is on loan technically until and the government is learning it to you until at some point in time they're going to say this is how much we want\nRight and it was eleven hundred thousand and taxes of six hundred and seven thousand savings to say well let's just round the number to a million jobs this easy numbers\nAnd and it's not uncommon for people to have a million dollars or several million dollars in IRA or four one K. money especially if they were investing heavily during the nineties when the crazy days went\nUm and and uh you got some really good returns back then and not so bad the last ten years either so ah let's just use that a million dollar mark if it's a hundred thousand dollars that you have to work with great just take a zero off if you got ten million just out of the year it's going to be the same discussion [noise]\nWhen you're Seventy and a half you're going to have to take out just under four percent of that number so for a person with a million dollars and a four O. one K.\nThey might have a pension they might have no bills they might be living within their neat means on Social Security and maybe other cash flow from a rental property is up and all of a sudden they get forty thousand dollars forced upon them an income they have to take out of their IRA\nAnd it may cause them to jump into a new tax bracket maybe from the Fifteen bracket up to the twenty five racket that means you pay ten percent more on that forty thousand dollar withdraw that forty thousand withdrawal now cost you ten thousand dollars in taxes just on the federal level if that bumps you up to that bracket\nAnd then it also has a snowball effect on your Social Security being taxed Social Security\nMedicare premiums go up when we talk about those of our MDs coming out they can cause more than just the basic federal tax bracket problem\nNow consequently as well and what a lot of people don't realize is every year you get older that amount goes a as\nYour retirement accounts club so let's just say your accounts ... growing by more than four percent next year you're going to have to take out more than that first year are empty by the time you're in the eighties or nineties that comes up to about ten percent and if you've been able to grow your IRA maybe now you have to take a hundred or a hundred and twenty thousand dollars out of your\nUh a couch and now you're in an even higher tax write maybe now you just move the twenty eight or thirty or thirty three bracket\nNot to mention there's four levels of Medicare premiums you could be in the highest premium by then whether you like it or not so how do you get out of those taxes can dirty is\nWell going back and I was going to say is um the decisions back on for the decisions you make today can have a major impact on getting you into a lower tax bracket and ... and even maybe even ends erode tax bracket if the planet correctly right went to not be awesome\nBut it it wouldn't it is a lot of people can do that in this age your tax break that we have a head give us a lot of years to do either Ross conversions where you can pay the taxes now at a lower tax rate\nSo you don't have to pay taxes later you can convert to alert which we love the L.

your current advisor or perhaps you don't have one that's OK today I Want to talk to you about how having a financial specialist one that specializes in building retirement income is so important to your financial help\nEspecially as you are near or already in retirement\nAt Mayfield financial an estate protection services for over twenty five years we have specialized in creating safe income strategies for our clients\nWe oversee more than one hundred million dollars in safe money client funds right here in Tucson and have over one thousand clients that enjoy our retirement income planning strategies\nSo what do we do and why do our clients love us it's pretty simple we are safe money advisors and for that certain part of your portfolio we do not recommend or use any strategies or investments that have the potential to lose money from stock market risk\nWe have never had to have a conversation with any of our clients about why they lost money due to stock market performance\nNo of course we're more than just one trick pony is over here and Mayfield financial over the years we have assembled an entire team a financial specialists that can take care of everything you need in the financial world in retirement\nBut here at Mayfield financial we believe and know that getting this first part of your retirement plan the safe money income part is so crucial so we focus entirely on that\nAs safe money specialists in the financial world we can help you turn that part of your retirement portfolio into what it needs to be in retirement and that is income income that last one that grows and is protected\nAnd now it doesn't have to be income that starts right now some of the best planning takes place about five years before you need to start to use your nest egg in retirement before you start to need to get that income\nSome call it the retirement danger zone and that's about five years before and after you retire that's the time where it's most important\nSpeak with a retirement income specialists one that can create a guaranteed income stream and protect your retirement from stock market losses\nIt's about building a foundation of income from that part of your portfolio to create the income for that you are going to want to have in retirement one that will take care of your essentials to cover your needs to take care of those basic expenses\nWhen you do that you unlock inability to truly have a worry free retirement\nSo to learn more for yourself on a sabotaging a foundation of income and about working with a retirement income specialist and to learn a little bit more about Mayfield financial\nInto income and in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you were a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan\nAnd it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even end\nIm period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action but in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of them and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement especially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives\nThis is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and then the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey failed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety a principal and guarantees\nThis is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and they failed financial NSA protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on\nAnd has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and the head of inflation\nAre safe money plants do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four O. one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive\nAll with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no conditions paid by you so what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get more information on how a safe money plan could help protect your hard earned money

presidents in Nineteen oh two two men were assigned fulltime the White House detail\nAnd most likely when you picture a secret service agent in your mind do you think of a man part of the reason for this might be because for much of our history better regulations prohibited women employees from carrying firearms\nThat prohibition was quietly lift it on September fifteenth Nineteen Seventy and on the same day the secret service set a precedent among federal law enforcement agencies when they appointed the first female officer to the executive protection service\nIt remains a rope predominantly populated by men less than ten percent of the special agents are female today we're going to talk to one of them\nOnly lens was twenty two years old when she joined the secret service one of the

radio Melanie Lance\nHi well thank you for having me\nWell Melanie this is going to be exciting we've only had one former Secret Service agent on the show in the garage and the five years I've been doing this before and certainly never a female Secret Service agent\nOh I'm Glad to be\nMore to well let's turn off a little bit about you Melanie what from your own admission based on what I've read about you you were shy introverted you know kid in the back of a classroom a very bright but what inspired someone like you to join the secret service\nRight well like you said I have I've always been a an introverted person I'm kind of one of those bookworm type but like many men and women in a college years I had no idea what I really wanted to do with my life I knew I wanted to do something meaningful with my life\nI wanted to make my living doing something that you know for the greater good kind of thing that with my attitude and I wasn't sure where my calling was\nUm and I grew up in a very patriotic family both my mom and my dad had a lot of military experience until they always grew up you know very very patriotic\nAnd so when I was getting ready to graduate from college and I went into grad school my grandpa is the one who originally again today and he's a former army airborne guy and one of his buddies had a daughter who is an agent\nAnd the you know the dad the proud and so they're sharing these crazy cool stories about this woman you know traveling all over the world and protecting foreign dignitaries and all these things she was doing and my grandpa that you know metal you were a college athlete you're smart like you should you should apply you would be good\nAnd my entered itself thought well you know I don't have those bulky by that and you know the aviators and the cop here you know what when where do you think I Would be oh what do I have\nUm they instructors felt they would deficient in my command president you know already figure you know I'm not a big and a lot of the guys in the class I'm not an old is the guy is a lot of the guys in the class and\nI Would think to myself I'm giving a hundred percent I Am I Am I'm fighting with all of my heart kind of thing um and early on in training we had to do a baton test a agents are issued those collapsible asked baton\nUm luckily I never had to you that I'm In the field accepted you know retreat my cell phone from a\nFight or something so thankfully I never had to whack anybody with them but definitely hurts if you do I hear\nBut we had to pass the test and their technique and ways to keep people at bay after you know you have to be able to protect your protect the though I have to be proficient at this\nAnd the instructor just seem to be just getting on me and practiced it constantly you know you might as well give up you know I I don't believe you are you I Can't hear you you know how they kind of talent you mess with you and and I was getting frustrated because I thought I I Am I'm I'm I'm screaming you know what is going on here\nUm and so I was I was very very nervous going into tenth day I thought you know it doesn't matter at this point they already think I'm going to fail and this is my last day you know those the perfectionist doom and gloom mentality going into a test [noise] um but I remember when\nIt was a lot that we always went alphabetically and my last name is Lance which puts me in the middle so half my class had gone and I'm watching them you know just dump this red man this guy and this instructor in this full padded red suit so we way along this guy and he's our assailant coming to try to kill are protected and we have to stop him\nAnd so I'm watching my classmates to do this so well and I'm I'm nervous and the guy calls me up the instructor he tells me my scenario which is something to the effect of\nYou know you're protecting the president just finished his speech and you're walking into the motorcade go\nAnd I just looked at him as like a click this pen with this um clipboard like yeah right here we go you know you're not going to make it and it got me my blood boil a little bit and it was that moment where it was like you don't think I can do this so like watch me you know it was that moment in my head like that stubbornness didn't mean well I said you know\nI'll show you and\nI had no idea that I had such a a voice in me or that I could hit so hard or that I could be so aggressive I did I had never been in a fight before I'm In that regard so\nThat test was almost kind of a blur to me it was just like I just went all out and screaming and yelling and you know fighting with all of my mind and it seemed like it went on forever and ever and then finally they called stop and I like kinda like took my first breath of the whole test like oh my gosh it's over and I kind of looked around and everybody just kind of standing there gaping\nAt [laughter] and so I'm like oh no is that good is that badly and one of my uh one of them one of my favorite uh classmates kind of gave me a little wink like you've got this you know you're okay so I kind of relaxed a little bit and um when I walked back over to the instructors they just said I passed and they gave\nMe a score and I didn't hear it all I heard was passed and I was like oh my gosh you know have to come back tomorrow in and keep doing this but it was a pivotal moment in training where\nI really I'm not going to get anywhere near positive in this experience if I stay within my comfort zone would just be quieter\nAnd it was it was after that moment that I started to more excel in training as opposed to be\nKind of holding back and um but anyway that was kinda funny to watch my instructor or by it started and my classmates when we were going back to our rooms that night there were like Mel I did I I have never seen that but he said I Will I Will I Will protect anybody with you any day now\nKnow anyone who's not been in this time the training you put a human an average of course a larger than the average person in Redmond shoot a it's a pretty imposing figure a minute's pretty frightening [laughter]\nEven though you're on your sons were training so once once you received your badge was there was a thing where we once you've gone up people no no she earned it she's like the rest of us She's she's a female but that's that's all\nUm I Would say you know I kind of stay in training I kind of felt like people maybe minimize me because of my age more than my gender but when I got out of training obviously had I had passed the same test that everybody else had passed but then you kind of feel a little bit of the more the gender kind of\nThing you know you find yourself in positions where you know you might not be at the most visible post um when you're you know at a campaign rally I was hired in two thousand and seven so my first year at a training was the two thousand and eight presidential campaign\nWhich we all know that Obama McCain campaign season was absolutely nuts so I got a lot of experience but I Would find like oh I'm kinda you know backstage or you know you always feel like you're not getting the exposure because maybe they think you're just not as experienced or you can't handle it\nBut my my work ethic\nThat kind of you know personality so I worked really hard my first couple of years out of training I'm trying to establish this work ethic that you know I can do this I'm going to I may not um I may not have the most experience but I I'm going to give it my all and I'm going to get that experience one way or the other\n... ... ... of of Secret Service agents you want to be\nDiscreet you you need to have a presence but you don't necessarily want folks to know that hey there's ... she's a secret service agents do you think and sometimes the it was an advantage for you to be young and female\n[noise] right ... I I Do think so there were on the secret service doesn't just work the protection aspect they do with the investigative aspect as well counterfeit currency fraud\nAnd in the Los Angeles field office at the large field office you know high population so there was never a shortage of investigations or protection assignments in Los Angeles\nBut I found I had an advantage in the investigative realm by being female because I could blend in better in surveillances nobody suspected this twenty something year old blonde girl to be this a secret service agent so\nThere's a kind of a funny story about that for a counterfeit case [noise] um I was asked is with us surveillance the the suspects were going to Las Vegas and passing a lot of this counterfeiting currency in Las Vegas\nI'm In Los Angeles is just to you know shortage drive out there so I was out um went out there and the suspect went into one of the casinos and um I still looked very young and so I'm kind of following this guy around a little bit around the casino kind of just being all laying low but I kept getting stopped by security\nBecause they said hey honey you you're not allowed to be in here you're not old enough or let me see some ID and I'm like oh my gosh you know they have to get the you know I bought some one of my colleagues it'd be like hey can you take over for a second you know kind of thing um so I ended up\nJust having to go to the security office every day when I started my a surveillance shift and ask for those wristbands you know hey I'm I'm old enough [noise]\nBut um but those kinds of things people wouldn't suspect me on and on the protection side I found that I had an advantage when I'm a protect the would want to do something kind of low key you know they live such public lives they don't they can't even go to\nThe grocery store without a secret service person\nFollowing them around in the U.S so you think about that you know maybe they want that private moment once in a while and Jill Biden Joe Biden's wife came into Los Angeles one time\nAnd she wanted to go for a run on the beach in or near Santa Monica you know run the boardwalk but she's like I don't want it to be this big gaggle of people I just want to be low key just go for morning jog before I have to give my speech later\nYadda yadda when they called me to go running with her and that was probably one of my most fun experiences that I got to go you know I have my ear on I just have a baggy T. shirt and it's me and Joe Biden and another younger looking guy from the office\nUm went behind and we were able to to allow you know up you know a noteworthy or or you know recognizable figure to have a a quiet moment so those kind of instances I always felt like I had\nSomething to offer you know I I can I can make this person and so those instances I was always grateful for because I felt I had something meaningful to offer\nNo no I Know this was one of those things where there's probably questions you can't answer but in cases like that who's the one of the chemistry concern science you tell one of these people know you are not going running on the beach in a discussion or do you have to sort of rich than we're on how to make it work\nUm well I think they do have those conversations but those were way above my pay grade so\nAnd the Joe Biden in it but I Know that um [noise] you know certain people probably wouldn't be able to do that maybe you know the president may have a harder time making that happen um but it definitely is one of those things where ... you get involved then we work out something to make it for every one\nOkay and so I I guess what I'm hearing it it's interesting to me it turn it sounds like your your life experience being someone used to being in the background\nStarted to serve you very well as a as a secret service agent\nI think though you know I sometimes we think our strengths and weakness you know in some cases it benefited me you know getting my life experience in that way\nOkay two two quick questions how who decides or how do they assigned the code names for protecting who decides whether you know President Reagan Scott and uh what was what was Nancy Reagan code name rain rainbow who chose that\nI missed the glaring jak goals and my personal life absolutely\nSo at that point when when the wheels are coming in your personal life I mean we're we're in order for your personal your personal duties and your commitment to the secret service which one do you start to get this taken care of\nMy life fell apart and and it kind of slapped me in the face in my case um [noise] yeah it's it's one of those where I was only with Nancy Reagan for about ...\nWhen most agents when they become an age and they they view themselves as going to Washington DC and protecting the president or the vice president you know that\nMost people um you know no offense to Mrs Reagan but most people don't get on the job thinking oh I Want to go protect you know Mrs Reagan who's in her nineties you know that wasn't necessarily I lost my job I I wanted to do you know move up and do what I was supposed to do career wise um\nBut I it wound up being going to Nancy Reagan's detail wound up being a huge blessing because when my marriage was falling apart and I wasn't doing well I I was traveling as much on Nancy Reagan the tale I wasn't um you know I was able to have a little more set schedule that sort of thing so it allowed me to\nStart protecting myself and I think that started after Mrs Reagan passed away you know there are a lot of things in life that will prompt some life reflection but standing in an embalming room for two days that will prompt a lot of life reflection\nAnd then being at her funeral\nUm the official funeral that was televised\nI was in the back of the room at my post and I was listening to this woman I up learning about this woman that I had protected for less than a year but I didn't really know well it was all professional ... you know logistics and where are we going and that sort of thing but I learned about her everybody talked about her leaving a legacy of love\nAnd I was in the middle of the divorce by then it was I always stand back of the room ... my legacy is not this you know go get her twenty two year old anymore I'm I'm a mess you know I Need to make some changes and\nUm the the or there was kind of up prompted that because I hadn't fulfilled my full protection time as an agent with only being on Nancy Reagan detail less than a year so I got transferred orders to Washington DC\nWhich that made a big a big life decision I hadn't had to make on my own I'd been I've been married or in a relationship my whole adult life\nAnd um once Mrs Reagan passed away and I got these transfer orders and I had a lot of reflection to do and learning about Nancy Reagan and\nRealizing I wanted to leave a different legacy than I was headed I I was I was very depressed very sad and it was getting divorced I'm not that kind of ... you know I'm not this person um and I ended up I ended up leaving the agency and that was one of the most difficult decisions I ever made in my life\nBut I realized how much if I stayed trainable in my thirties like I was in my twenties I learned a lot about life from the secret service and that was that I had neglected to protect myself when I had the option and it was time to start doing that now and it was wasn't too late for me\nSo that kind of a that processes what sparked writing the book\n...

with access control\nExplain to our listeners what that is in the secret service and then how that applied as you were trying to decide what you do in your personal life\nRight [noise] uh well if you think about it access control is really the fundamental element of protection and the secret service um [noise] you have to control who is allowed to get close to your protect the to ensure that they're safe at all times\nUm but some people need access to the to the president let's say for example if he's a ... going on on um you know the Ellen DeGeneres show or something to that effect
