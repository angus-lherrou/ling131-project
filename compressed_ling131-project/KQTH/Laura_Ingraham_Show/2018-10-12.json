quickly most quickly rebuild your financial life now that you're rebuilding your overall life and uh that's the stuff you're hearing me teach every day that get on a written plan a budget\nOr avoid that build up an emergency fund and then begin investing long term um and as you're able to get out on your own again medically and financially you will do that to re establish yourself as a you know a single young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now\nBut a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your whole life\nA show there that's a cool thing uh but you know the basic stuff we talk about here saving for emergencies investing being generous avoiding that um\nYou know living on a written planet budget

stuff hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get you into financial peace university Michelle is in Watertown South Dakota Hi Michelle how are you\nWill get they don't give her taking my call certainly how can I help\nUm well I just started get program and August I'm I have currently pay down three thousand dollar that um that just got to actually that's the guy I was making payments on monthly payments on how\nI'm right now I Need to ... I might get that through collection of what you're getting out and then move out and dollars mhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlement from the male ... or less like I had a federal king hundred dollar bill that they're they're\nGetting paid a cake founding hundred for a friend of mine was telling me that that thousands of dollars that were given mhm\nThat I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering how true\nThat is true definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays\nOh okay so what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay so let's say let's say you're on a ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal what's your yeah\nYour I have about two hundred dollars per thousand for that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so yeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have in in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question thank you for joining us\nOpen phones is ours we talk about your life and your money our question that comes from blinds dot com you do not need a

meeting will consist of adults\nHow often\nShould we have these meetings and do we share specific dollar amounts with every one or just share with each individual what will affect them\nUm\nAnnually would be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten until it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our\nCase did not know\nOur wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but I had a lot of wealth in the background and\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about [noise] but then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery because I was for me in my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of\nSo they need to be emotionally mature and ... with them and we do about once a year [noise]\nThis is that Iran to show\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage can tell

turn and try this there had it had to be pretty bumpy\nYeah it was it was hard hard to trust her right she spent her whole life living this way with this chaos with money and in debt and and I did it take you to trust her\nIt probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's I'm seeing the action not just the words right\nMore I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this I mean you really had to see that that go a little bit a glimpse of\n... is is it grew yeah trust grew over time\nIn the moment I got home from your class I was going through my doors for trying to sell so I mean what can I sell so I sold jewelry I so I mean you know he was seeing that I was

and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities

line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\n[noise] um and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and wait till ...\nCar worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example say no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle\nUh they're typically well built I mean ... again Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um the larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck a Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nAh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all\nUh again though I kind of depends on your budget and how nice of car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or no got they got about fifty something on it and um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um so you know you just you're looking at your situation to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how can I just I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how're you\nHey they take 'em off Sherman what's up I'm going I cook a mere I've got about three thousand dollars and I mean the count out donating should I in bed and if I knew what China and you're going to college the community college with an H ... program in St Louis and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service the five of the Caribbean I keep them at the community colleges is either and you're at in the workforce yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that on crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be an hour or whatever\nOkay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it or\nHere's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale\nOf one to pin a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and is a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nAnd you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds a you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account\nTo stage a with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal\nFor you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nAnd your field of study whether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the ... tech field or or\nWhether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools and your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any of that and that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than broaden the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you you\nToo sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward in time for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our grows take home pay into our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine prevent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from all agree the coloration so when we save the thicker than we're able to have a lot for a mortgage coloration though is it okay to do that or him recommend saving the twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you invested in that is that uh uh you're choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nAt the end and there's no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven uh okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect okay I probably would split the difference because I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be\nYou don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run through\nIts horribly run state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we got us before then that means we need to put in ten percent right\nYou got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that
