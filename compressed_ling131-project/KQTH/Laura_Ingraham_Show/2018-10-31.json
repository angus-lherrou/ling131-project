day up to me John ... retirement evolution\nTune in Saturday morning at ten and Sunday afternoon at two for retirement or ball right here on one oh four one K. cutie H. two sons news and talk diagnosing\nThe pathology is across the nexus between liberalism the Democrat Party in the media the slant show right here one\nAnd they the immediate post civil war era and he said we have to look at the purpose of the original intent\nWas intended to give full rights to free the slaves of full rights of citizenship and and he said you you've missed ugly that there were those in certain states they were Democrats in southern states\nThat didn't want to grant full right so that's the purpose of the fact I\nAnd and then later and I'm really not to a hundred years later in the Nineteen sixties then we start to expand the meaning the interpretation\nOf the language contained in the fourteenth amendment and now President Trump is causing us to take another look at the language\nAnd it will be sorted out and I I Would put to you that first of all legislation should be passed so you know liberals love being in sync with European countries\nIt would put us in sync with European countries to do away with our current birthright citizenship status you know not a lot of people go to ... to take advantage of their birthright citizenship\nUh Ireland's done away with an England's done it with France has done it with their journey has done or they've ah they've all done away with it all the places liberals go on\nVacation they've done away with birthright citizenship Jonathan Turley well what did the authors of the fourteenth amendment intend what were they talking about and I was reading earlier from some of the uh the language from\nFrom the the author of the actual ... who was a Michigan Republican senator and he quite explicitly said in his writings what it was intended to include in what what is not intended to include senator Jacob\n... said in his writings what it was intended to include in what what is not intended to include senator Jacob Howard of Michigan uh every person born within the U.S one instance subject jurisdiction this will not he said of course include persons born in the U.S who are foreigners\nOkay aliens\nOr who belong to the families of ambassadors that should give you a clue as to what the intent of the fourteenth amendment was Jonathan Turley\nSome of the draft or is of the fourteenth amendment indicated that they did not believe that this language was unlimited birthright protections are guaranteed I some of them actually ... ah put in legislation a limiting a birthright citizenship to children of citizens or legal resident\nNow as a calm cool and collected scholarly type of person\nHe uh Jonathan Turley this one is that like I don't like the executive order approach that President Trump is taking but at the same time you know if you turn the channel look at CNN all this insanity and the range they love the rage that's ridiculous to say there is a a reasonable measured legal scholar Jonathan Turley\nYeah I don't understand all the hyperbole in anger about this this has been a long standing debate there's good faith arguments on both sides the natural reading of this amendment which seem to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the history\nThe tax some of the drafter tend to go the other way and courts will view clauses like this is having meaning they don't just this\nTense them so the question is why was this clause put in what was referencing and you can make a disease or certainly make a good faith argument that it limit\nBirth rates is birthright citizenship the United states is something of an outlier there's only about thirty countries have recognized unlimited birthright citizenship or that doesn't mean that you can use an executive order you know I testified against President Obama using executive orders I think it was wrong that I think it's wrong now\nYeah but it starts the conversation that gets the ball rolling\nA anyway a size and he said it's hilarious you go to CNN MSNBC the Washington Post they said Trump is an outrageous liar and fraud and are racist on his uniform and he said no other country has birthright citizenship when thirty or thirty three other countries have birthright citizenship\nYeah look at which countries first of all now the president may have gotten that wrong or misspoken or he may have a but the news media is trying to make it sound like we're the outlier ... surely use the word outlier there\nThat were the outlier because there are thirty three other countries whether about two hundred countries in the world\nAnd of those approximately two hundred countries and its approximate\nBecause it depends on whether you account and Dora and and the Vatican and the Palestinian territories and so different people count in different ways about two hundred is a good and fair number and we're not the outlier in fact uh the thirty or so that have birthright citizenship\nThey're kind of the outliers at this point not the other way around also Jonathan Turley points out that Lindsey Graham is now proposing legislation in the Senate or and he prefers that approach\nBut I think Lindsey Graham's proposals legislation or could have a stronger case to make in court\nNow at us for the president's executive order a which hasn't happened yet but it's been suggested\nKenny change\nFourteenth amendment whether an executive order or I Would I be based on my reading of this and the way I was brought up I Would say no you can't change it but here's the question have we share\nI Would I be based on my reading of this and the way I was brought up I Would say no\nYou can't change it but here's the question have we changed the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment overtime to the point where the president wouldn't really be changing it he would be restoring the status quo ante restoring its in its original intent\nI'm John Berman is a CNN a finger he's a finger\nOn uh the cable news network in the morning he's a he's an angry little Democrats and he hates President Trump and and he is not a legal scholar or anything but they play one on TV\nIs also claimed that he can to fire the U.S constitution and birthright citizenship fires Republican lawyer they say no\nSay that they said they they go and Republican lawyers\nConstitutional scholars on Republican lawyers they say no but I just had Jonathan Turley on a saying then so they say well there's universal agreement that's a lie he's a lion little second we're All right and\nI and he lives all the time because he hates Trump so much now you can debate it but these frauds these these thinkers coming on here just by the U.S constitution is not looking to defy the U.S constitution he's challenging the conventional wisdom\nOn a on the fourteenth amendment on birthright citizenship and by the way the words birthright citizenship do not appear on the fourteenth amendment so in these people like Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post pretend that this is settled because it's in shrine than the fourteenth amendment\nShow me where it's been tried in the ... where it's not subject to where it hasn't been hotly debated over the years and then I just love this thing Maggie Haberman that tired haggard to New York times typos for the\nDemocratic Party who doesn't know what ... who is four she was on the television this morning and the short run this little thing just made me laugh it's about how exhausted that they are\nFrom President Trump they're they're just they're exhausted here's exhausted them that they they think they're in the fabric ... but they're not he has he has a defected from here's here's exhausted them they're completely worn down to knobs and she looks like it to\nAn attorney in politics in general let alone and the Trump era I feel like\nI just like that part you know election day the mid term elections those way to get the electric the midterm elections are six days away it's like well is this going to play him to the mid term elections and she's like I have no idea there are six days away

nations and they have a list of demands and the news media is like oh that's great isn't that wonderful that's the best thing ever\nBut they're upset the news media the New York times on ... on CNN that the president has successfully made the caravan into a political issue I think the Democrats created the caravan to some degree or another and then birthright citizenship\nI Will say there

agency I Would say like I was ...\nOkay so I Am in college as well to come back on the part that goes on the you'd think my my next step should be to talk to a tree and be in contact with the um the

something I should keep paying dental insurance is one of the most easy insurance has to figure out that they're charging you more than you are getting\nUm we've had dental insurance proposed to us as a a a employee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you'd never spend that much on dentistry\nIt just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us that is a a dental discount company and that is worth it\nBecause that helps you get discounts on your dental repairs your dental work and so forth\nAnd um you know you can check them out as well you can find them on our website one dental is what it's called one dental and er James just helped me 'cause I was looking at him my brain was it was firing and I couldn't remember are great people to have gotten to know them\nOne dental but it's a discount program for dental services now that is worth it and we do that but

deserve what's up\nOh my goodness longtime listener and just so excited never called before [noise] so um my husband and I our debt free including our house white again yeah well thank you for your teaching we followed them off [laughter]\nUm and we are actually we're everyday millionaires I'm a teacher he's an electrician and um so we we've been investing in a way that you recommend and you know just out of curiosity we finally decided to meet with an email we went online and found one that you your site recommend\nA main battle over investing\nYes okay yes yes in or if I'm not factor ... thank you okay um and we met with him and he was very ah you know had a lot of information for us\nAnd then you know the the structure is like a ... percent [laughter] I guess and\nSo why my husband and I didn't know is simply been investing in a way that you teach since we've been you know we both are blessed to have pension\nWe have you know we're only in our fifties and we ... we could retire and five years you don't have to [laughter] but we we couldn't be comfortable um what what is it still makes sense\nTo hire\nUm a financial person for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year because they go on a five point five percent of what you're\nActually they're lucky they're proposing a ... a manager to count for you\nCorrect OK yeah a lot of the industry has gone to the managed to count approach and on and so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you come ... and I'm anytime you're investing in when I'm investing by the way my\nPersonal money's invested with one of our smart rushed her approach okay um and so the\nThere's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront sees\nA that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no\nAnnual after that or they managed to count worry it's a percentage of the balance every year\nAnd they know what are you getting to that well they're helping you select the funds and putting you in funds that are out performing the market overall um you know I Hope over a long period of time over average you know funds that outperform the U.S and the and of course you've got\nWe're all um you know I Hope over a long period of time over average you know funds that outperform the S. and P. and of course you've got someone to meet with in cover anytime there's a question about anything\nI'm a if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down um anything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that\nYou will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking a proper funds and to a you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not doing that one\nWhen we look at I mean I can do every day you know kind of see you've got that Dali and you're not going to jump off the rollercoaster and get hurt you know so\nThat that part of stuff so you know the thing is just asked them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging and uh you know because you're charging me a fee argue worth that\nAre in in most cases you'll find it is\nIt that way they are trying to make more than the cost of the fee in extra returns and certainly in services in terms of um you know education that's available to you and um you know there's eight thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with a thousand mutual funds I have a day job\nYou know and so a a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long this comb through those funds it's their whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's I also don't work on my own car\nI could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fixes it but it would take me longer\nOr there'd be several trial and error is along the way I might break something in the process and so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that actually has the computer that hooks up to the car instead of me being a redneck laying on the trying to figure this out\nAnd it's kind of like you know investments out on the eye why those either um I don't even do my own taxes\nUh and I'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do I'm a money guy and got a natural for math and all that
