retired it's your money with Jeff voting and Linda ... from from your retirement planning and wealth management starts now [noise]\nRetiring is one thing staying retired as a whole nother thing are you planning for retirement not sure when to retire if you're ready to retire picking out your retirement they might be the most difficult task of all of them that's what our shows about today on it's your money I'm Jeff vogue and president of the premier retirement planning a wealth management here with my host Linda ... good morning\nGood morning unhappy weekend it's always a happy weekend when we're here on the weekend yeah it is no no stress just ... about retirement and helping people retire and stay retired and eating or pop tarts\nWhen we're here on the weekends\nYeah it is no no stress just ... and about retirement and helping people retire and stay retired and eating or pop tarts and eat it [laughter] that's kind of the tradition now is we're kind of a pop star pop tart weekend strawberry again to wow I Love it [laughter] so how do you know when it's time to retire do you ever\nMet for that one I think that's the then major question around the the water cooler and can I retire am I in the in the right position financially mentally to retire\n... well it a lot of it is a there's a lot of things have ... a factor and it's you know it is it a magic number is it a certain a multiple of your income\nIs it ah how expensive is your bucket list all of those things really have to come into play and there really isn't a right or wrong answer the right or wrong answer is going to be just really what's right for you there's a interesting list of ten questions I'll just fly through them really quick that I kinda thought provoking about the idea of retirement like what factors did you consider before you decide to retire\nWhat happens if you retire before eight sixty five need some extra healthcare we're going to cover some of these things today or can you continue to work past full retirement age and still draw Social Security a big question some people want to have their cake and eat it to want to take their Social Security as early as possible it don't want to quit working that's okay\nAh what age did you start drawing Social Security of course that's the it depends answer of all time\nAnd how do you transition from making contributions to your accounts like for one k.'s and retirement accounts to\nLearning to take income that's a whole whole nother of it's kind of a paradigm shift for most people are there specific rules of thumb that you should refer to win seeing if my nest egg is large enough to retire and what's that magic number we talked about that before and again another\nRule of thumb that's a that's an it depends there's so many rules of thumb that I think most people ... broken they for me [laughter]\nAh what type of debts acceptable you know it's it's amazing to see how many retirees still have ... and you know what is not necessarily a bad thing so we're not going to just rag on people for ads that were and what it has and yeah and if you have cash flow and if it or you know if it's a choice between cash flow into savings it may be smarter to keep a little bit of debt\nSo um what about if you're married or have some of the spouse soul tricks and things that you can do to choose one and take your retirement or a plan or your or your Social Security\nWell a lot of clients come in and then they're stressing over that one name decision can I retire should I retire\nAnd it's it's not easy and it's ... you're used to getting up and going to work every day I and getting that paycheck and that's one of the reasons why income and planning for guaranteed income is so important when you retire you're not going to get that paycheck for your company anymore\nRight so the income now comes from a reduced amount typically it's a reduced amount from Social Security almost nobody I Know makes more than Social Security then they made in their job [noise]\nUm do they have a pension do you have a pension that'll supplement that or do you need to take all of your income\nFrom investments and how well if you invested ... have you been along the the the way\nYou know we have a saying to you know if you achieve and be able to live out that ideal retirement life you've probably had to make a few smart decisions along the way so granted sometimes we don't make all the right decisions sometimes we learn by our mistakes unfortunately but um\nYeah we do have to make a make some smart decisions not just while we're planning to retire but also as we are planning that transition from okay I've saved now what can I Do to make this savings become income that I can rely on as long as I live how can I make sure that it pays my bills like my paycheck did\nHow can I make sure my bucket list\nItems can be taken care of within that income you know don't leave those all that\nIt's like my paycheck did how can I make sure my bucket list items can be taken care of within that income you know don't leave those all to chance you know how expensive is your budget and I think the biggest thing that people are probably hate to do is that budget\n... yeah it's it's not as funny um exercise to do that knowledge is power and when you know where you're spending money what you're spending your money on it gives you more power to say is this necessary do I need this is this must stories just say I want and can you cut back and we'll talk a little bit more about that when we get into\n'em that that I Know we set it many many times when you're getting ready to retire that five years before maybe even ten years for some people it's a time where they have to do a paradigm shift between accumulating those assets and then turning them into income\nAnd if you are relying solely on assets in your retirement to draw down especially now looking what's happening in the market everybody's starting there is a little bit of panic out there\nThat if your money is not in a safe position and now they're a couple of weeks and this downturn or correction if you will and the market could wipe out or severely damaged somebody's nest eggs\nAnd they would pay out at approximately five hundred or a five percent mhm okay so let's just say instead of trying to grow your assets in a in a risky market to one point two five million\nFrom age sixty to Seventy hoping you get to that one point two five million and a stock and bond market instead taking half of that money or have a half a million five hundred thousand dollars and putting it in a in a product or of\nAn annuity account that would guarantee fifty thousand dollars a year starting at age Seventeen regardless\nJust think of what you could do that ten years how much you could saving their four one K. you not only have your fifty thousand dollars made up\nBut you also have all that extra will be ... check money in accounts that you could use it for more discretionary investment so I'm a new lease can guarantee income so that you can play with or\nRisk more of your other income it kind of help should be at a position to swing for the fences without having to be scared every day if you're\nGoing right right well and it I Want to go back as the ad touched on it at the end of the first section is the first and foremost important is to identify what your expenses are and I know is when at that paycheck is coming in\nYou don't really think about that budget and when that paycheck goes out you want to know where you're spending your money and that's if you started now that will be a habit that you farm going into retirement but then on the flip side identify what you're guaranteed income is going to be\nAnd see what that was like you said Jeff that balance between does it on a scale\nWhat's higher or your expenses higher or are your assets higher\nAnd do we need to save more do we need to work an extra couple of years to get there do we need to a park some of our money now into a guaranteed growth annuity that will pay you a certain amount of income later which will solve some of that problem in other words it's just basically about gaps filling\nYou know where you want to be in where you are probably two different things there's probably a few gaps and there's probably a few things that need to be um built in you know guaranteed income for example is probably the most important one\nAnd when clients come into our office that's one of the things that we deal with that five point is we put their life if you will on on a spreadsheet one piece of paper\nAnd showing them and sometimes the answer to that question can I retire and yet shirt you're going to be okay it looks like everything's good and sometimes that question is answered with act you might need to consider working a little bit longer\nI had to do extra saving to put you in a better position for retirement\nAnd the best news is like the one we just had a couple of days ago where they came in and they said you know we think we can live on sixty thousand in retirement we know we're probably going to have to work another ten years and when it came down to it we found out that we could actually create a hundred thousand dollar a year plus income for them\nGuaranteed mhm and they only have to work six warriors that feel that\nThe type of thing that you really love to hear because I don't think they believe that could be done\nBut they were also believing based on these rules of thumb taking risk into consideration realizing that market crash ... and they couldn't go all out\nBut when we showed them how about a fifty fifty split between guaranteed assets principle protected assets could guarantee them enough income that they wouldn't have to worry about the other half of their assets or that they could use those other half of the assets in a more discretionary manner\nThat they had enough to live on a six figure income for life and not work till they're Seventy and that was that was that those are one of the best moments in my life is to see how happy people get when they realize that they're not doomed\nWork till they're Seventy and that was that was that those are one of the best moments in my life is to see how happy people get when they realize that they're not doomed to this\nYou know decade or more of a work that they're actually closer to retirement than they thought they were so you know if you want to see if you're ready or to see if you can now maybe retired earlier than expected that's another positive thing that may come out of that retirement readiness review\nAll you have to do to get one is called five to ... to one seven eighty five sixty six and we'll talk about those five points to retirement your income play on your investment plan your tax plan your healthcare plan and your legacy or your um estate plan\nSo before we go into our next break maybe we could just talk about a couple of the strategy is to create more savings before retirement for those of you are\nThat's actually where I have is going to go that if you do get the answer to that question is can act can retire and it's no aggressively looking at saving more\nAnd that doesn't mean saving aggressively that's what I mean oh I got to buy more apple and Amazon I don't want to you know we're not talking about aggressively investing we mean I'm I'm nine to ... much more later ...\nTo that for one K. if you're over fifty are you taking advantage of that catch a petition if you're single you can add sixty five hundred a ... a year or married couple it's around Thirteen thousand\nThat's just your IRA yeah those numbers are up to about twenty four thousand dollars if you're talking about a four O. one K. or at your employer and make sure you're taking the match and make sure you're maximizing those savings\nI started a special account that many goes in for only in the future not catch Jeanette and you'd\nBe amazed at how quickly does account for ... even collecting change your name when he said that little quaint thing and it was a thousand dollars in ...\nIt's amazing how fast little things can add up\nYour magic number is coming up next on nature many more strategies on how to create for you guys\n\nDoing\nWhether you're already retired are planning to retire just opening window where the unfamiliar return offending their wealth management will help you maximize your income minimize your taxes ... protect what you have more than a lifetime to achieve now back to his your money\n\nPaycheck at that time again for your financial hit that week yes it is and we're\nGoing to talk about what is better than bonds were to look at an caps fixed index annuities and would like to offer you a copy of the article that I'm basing this tip on and it's called the better the bonds a look at an kept fixed index annuities well for safety in performance you might find that\nThis new asset classes not new but it's relatively new fixed indexed annuities may be a better choice than bonds in fact I recently did a tip of the week which talked about Roger if it's in\nWho Yale professor who is digested all kinds of information over the years about Wall Street and trends and things as actually jumped ... I hate to say about jumped the wall street chip\nAnd kind of got on the fixed index annuity bandwagon with some of his own index is that uh that he's used in 'em and likes find out the index annuities can actually enhance the returns and keep money say\nBack to the article you know what to investors really want they want and gross they want safety and they want liquidity and then they want to give whatever's left of who they want how they want when they want right well unfortunately\nIt's kind of like a cake and eat it too scenario where it's hard to have all three\nThings in the same product\nUsually give up a little piece of one rather than the other for example the bond market uh\nIn the same product\nUsually give up a little piece of one rather than the other for example the bond market or you're going to compare this new a victim next and nobody was bonds\nThe bond market is a little bit skittish right now as interest rates are being raised by the fed and is the stock market becomes a little more favorable bonds become a little less favorable and they will lose value in what we call a bond bear market which may be going into\nSo how do you put your money in a safe place still get some growth reasonable growth and don't lose money\nWell the answer is well I'm going to use an example um the answer is probably best put to put to use by looking at a ... an example by jak Marion jak marrying the guy that goes back a few years and he\nUm is kind of the guru a fixed index annuities he's got a champion the idea to the financial world as an alternative for safe money\nUm he chose a fifty year timeframe from January first Nineteen sixty to January first two thousand and ten and what he did his he compared how one thousand dollar investment in the U.S and people would have performed under three scenarios one with no dividends one with the evidence and one with no dividends no and no losses\nSo the first two scenarios followed the ups and downs of the market one that the evidence one didn't now obviously the one with the evidence paid more I'll just give you the numbers with no dividends the basic nominal as some five hundred grew that one thousand dollars over that fifty year time period\nTo Eighteen thousand six hundred Fifteen dollars the sec and with the dividends obviously the evidence over the years of average about two percent but you compound that two percent over fifty years and it becomes quite a difference that ending balance was eighty four thousand two hundred and sixty dollars compared to the Eighteen thousand six hundred I just mentioned\nThe third if you could have no dividends added you could have just the upside in the market and none of the downside\nThe balance became one hundred and Seventy nine thousand six twenty four so which one would you rather have\nWell it's kind of a no brainer do the math on that one\nHundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars is a lot more than ... Eighteen thousand dollars and so I Would rather have no downs and just ups but what if you had just half of the ups in the markets and know downs would that still have been better sure it would have been better than the first two scenarios and that's how a fixed indexed annuity works\nThe fixed indexed annuity keeps your principles safe it uses the interest that they make on your money to leverage the index such as the essence ... five hundred the Dow NASDAQ or any other index that it may choose\nAnd by the way you get to pick what index your interest rate is credited on and there is a formula that the company offering these indexed annuities will offer you you get to choose and you get to pick you can look at history you can look at current data and make your own decision but if you get half of the upside of the market and none of the downsides chances are over a period of\nBe careful and remember that if you ... co sign on student debt or if you just decided to go back to school to take on a new career retirement whatever it is just make sure you can do a payoff that that that they will come out and get it from you if you can't or if the person that should be paying a cat\nAnd I look at another did some a little bit of research I've Thirteen kids to manage I'm not going to go through all Thirteen but um there's one that I Love and I use [laughter]\nMyself is that transfer the balance transfer at taking high interest rate um I'm Out cards and moving them to a Fifteen month twelve month zero interest ... a great way to start as long as you're paying those off and not adding more another\nCar take advantage of the special rates I I'm a little less in favor of doing the ... the home equity line of credit at a lower rate in order to pay off consumer debt because you are stuck with that debt on your home that does a ... and and if for whatever reason you can't pay that\nYou know you don't want to lose your home over it you know I I hate to say it but I'd rather walk away from a credit card debt and not lose my home\nThan stack everything on my home and end up coming up short of losing my home that's an so that's another thing that you have to be really careful on is making sure you don't want to take advantage of that oh look at all the equity having my home I can just pick up on my desk but now you have a bigger mortgage payment you know make sure you're casual is going to support that in good and bad times or you may jeopardize that to homeownership\nBut that was another one we get a lot of questions and people that they want to pay off their house before they go into retirement and now even though that the debt that's a better debt than credit card debt\nI Would rather have a hundred thousand dollars in savings\nBefore they go into retirement and now even though that the debt that's a better debt than credit card debt\nWell I Would rather have a hundred thousand dollars in savings for a rainy day than pay off my house with that hundred thousand dollars hadn't have zero savings if I had a Randy and I'll just give you a quick example if we have time as as my dad you know he had a stroke they had a hundred thousand dollars in savings and they end up spending it on his care\nThey could not and they had a house that was paid off for four hundred thousand dollars in California that they could not get a loan on why because he was invalid he could not ...\nSo they basically use all that money you spend on their house they had very little left and ended up spending it for his health care and mom was left in kind of dire straits so to see if you're a retirement ready come get her retirement readiness review with us from retirement planning of wealth management the number to call is five to ...\nTo one seven eighty five sixty six that's five to ... to one Seventy five sixty six will help you know if you're ready to retire as say beside\nThe decision on when and how to claim your Social Security benefits march for any kind of extra money and she says you might want to\n\n[noise]\nHi I'm Linda winning you probably heard me on the radio talking about making smart meant is that your money well I'm going to tell you I've\nJust made a smart move myself I Lived near retirement planning and wealth management a local farmer tub or twenty five years of helping people like you compare for and lived there ideal retirement light I made a smart move maybe you should too he'll call me at five ... seven eight zero\nNine zero five nine or does it as at ... dot com that P.

is one thing staying retired is another are you ready to retire that is the question we're tackling here on it's your money\nI'm Jeff Colgan your host president premier retirement planning and wealth management with my co host of the ...\n[noise] well back welcome back here we are again last segment you time flies when you're having fun doesn't it we've been talking about a lot\nOf different issues that just come up when people come in and talk to us about whether they're ready to retire well I have enough money will I live alone though how much can I spend that much can I not been how much should I say one should I take Medicare what should I take Social Security lots and lots of questions on the last year we are going to tackle is Social Security that's a big question\nAnd the point quite often or kill it is important question what is the most important things people need to know about Social Security [noise]\nWell the biggest question is when should I take my Social Security and the answer to that question is it depends everybody is different everybody's circumstances are unique to that\nI did I loaded you up with kind of a loaded question yeah\nThere is no him most important answer they're all important you know when should you take it is is really going to make a difference if you take it early mhm you can lose twenty five percent of your monthly benefit but you get it\nBut there are all important you know when should you take it is is really going to make a difference if you take it early and you can lose twenty five percent of your monthly benefit but you get a few extra years of income\nIf you hate your job it might be okay to take it early if you take it later and able to work an extra four five six seven even ten years or eight years between age sixty two in Seventy eight years of income and an increase\nFrom your full retirement age of thirty two percent per month or per year in actual income so\nWhen you when you take it is a makes a big difference on your lifetime income and there's also there's other things you have to factor in\nWhat about my spouse can they take a spouse or benefit what if I die early does she get my widow benefit is is waiting smarter for her if I die early and sometimes it's not just our own decision that we need to consider is that it was spouse in and out of our our entire financial situation so\nRight and even are you still working 'cause if you were still working you're getting an income now you're still putting into this as the security but that also does have a random vacations on how much have yourself a security as tax\nThat is true as well and if you're working before age sixty six or ... or your full retirement age which ever it is\nA once you start making a little over Fifteen thousand a year they start withholding some of your Social Security benefits\nAnd and I'm going to say that more often than not the it depends answer on if you're working and you still want to claim Social Security it's better to claim Social Security after your full retirement age so that you can keep it all [laughter] you don't have to give some of it back because the IRS or the higher the Social Security department\nDoesn't just hand you the lump sum that they've withheld they just increase the amount you get over the rest of what they consider your lifetime might be so\nUh you know if you have to take Social Security early be very careful on understanding the consequences of that and how much they're going to withhold and how you'll get that money back because that is money that isn't you are entitled to you put into the system and you should be able to get back so\nAgain it's one of those mathematical things do the math figure out what makes sense to you and figure out what your lifestyle dictates\nWell and you mentioned in married couples that there are a couple of other strategies that a married couple can use that ... that a single person doesn't had as far as taking that spouse will benefit now too that were really nice to married couples that that have been gone for the last couple of years or that Ireland suspending restricted application\nOh she got to tell everybody what they can't\nHave that owned by that still some people think that that still in play that there is that that spouse will benefit can actually be beneficial at when one spouse should take their their Social Security even taking it early and then getting that has ... half of the husbands later on\nWhen he starts taking his so\nYou have to be a certain age so that's why things coming for the Social Security ... will tell you if you're in that ballpark where you can take advantage of that loophole I wouldn't call it a loophole would just take advantage of the the way the law is you know I I had seen a loophole because it's not like we're cheating anything we're just thinking adage of of the rules\nAnd then there's other benefits rather Saturday he won't are single and and divorced or you have an ax so there is power and benefit it all depends on your situation right\nSo remember even if you don't have your own benefit or your own benefit isn't that much you can take half of your ... up to half of your spouse's benefit or up to half of an ex spouses benefit that may benefit you\nAnd uh the way the widow benefit works um is you can take that as early as age sixty if your spouse has pre deceased do and would have been at the age they could've taken Social Security\nUm when it comes to income planting keep in mind that not all of us die in the same year right as a as a couple right and if one of us out lives the other by a sickness\nBeing keep in mind that not all of us die in the same year right as a as a couple right\nAnd if one of us out lives the other by a significant amount of years uh consider the widow benefit the widow or the survivor gets the better of the two benefits as what may be smart for one of the spouses to wait especially the ... sometimes even the most unhealthy spouse\nTo wait so that the healthier surviving spouse that may outlive the other one uh would get a higher benefit for longer amount of years so a lot of things that are\nWe talking about that it gets a little confusing to one spouse this spouse\nThat well that's probably the things that come into play that or the ... I guess probably the more confusing elements that people need to iron out is how to make sure that we work it out with our spouses are surviving spouse those are some of the things that are\nKind of the unknowns but really need to be included in a plan and you need to plan for the contingencies the what ifs I mean that's that's really what retirement planning is nothing is certain nobody has a crystal ball you don't have your death date you don't have your purse or your death certificate in your hand yet\nHow do you know how long you're going to live on what you're going to need so a lot of big questions now the last um besides um Social Security we've got that health care question\nNine zero five nine or does it as at ... dot com that's P.

protection services\nOr Tucson based financial planning for for over twenty five years may feel financial has specialized in building worry free retirement solutions for thousands of satisfied southern Arizona in St Louis thing is a member of the national\nAssociation of insurance and financial advisors promoting sound financial planning right here in the Tucson area\nAnd now here to talk with you about worry free financial solutions and retirement your host Nathan burger ego\nWelcome to worry free financial solution [noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial an estate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nStock market the sock continues as one day we're up and then the next day it's back down [noise] so what exactly\nIs going on in the financial world and on Wall street and what's driving markets today now that the stock market has officially experienced it confirmed stock market corrections were values dropped by ten percent or more for many peak volatility is back in a big way\nOne of the major factors that has led to this correction besides the over Bob market melt up we saw in January where we saw stock markets up over seven percent Justin one month alone\nIs now all the talk about the end of free money\nWell you may want to know what is exactly free money and why didn't you get any of it\nWell you did actually in a way but maybe not how you exactly wanted to get it the end of free money is referring to the massive quantitative easing stimulus programs at the Federal Reserve established shortly after the big financial meltdown in two thousand eight and two thousand nine\nThis economic stimulus was designed to boost the economy by injecting low cost or even no cost capital or money into the banking system and on Wall street\nThis is called in was called quantitative easing also known as Q. E. and we had to eat one\nAnd on Wall street this is called in was called quantitative easing also known as Q. E. and we had to eat one you eat two and three and then she we infinity\nNow here we are and the feds have officially ended quantitative easing back in two thousand Seventeen\nDuring this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation was still very low and yes did it work maybe but what did this quantitative easing or this free money really give us well it gave us low interest rates and most of us have benefited from that in some sort of way\nPerhaps a lower rate on a house or a car or a business loan we become addicted to these low interest rates\nSo has Wall Street low rates also means low saving rates on bank money which causes us to seek higher returns elsewhere like in the stock market\nAnd well that has worked wonderfully over almost eight fold nine years now so here we are at a critical point in our history and our economy with inflation fears now at the forefront of discussion we've already seen interest rates now taking a little higher\nWe're now seeing spikes in the yields on what most consider a risk free investment and that is the ten year treasury note\nWhen inflation starts to become a problem well the Federal Reserve will respond and the only way they know how\nAnd that is by raising interest rates and when that happens when interest rates rise that can start to put the brakes on the economy and then our whole economic cycle starts to change and our time of grow turns into a time of contraction\nNot that that's the idea of the Federal Reserve to cause a recession but it's just the nature of the beast it's economics\nAnd when that happens or there is even the slightest indication of something like that happening Wall Street is way ahead of the game on this and we'll start to see yet another bear market and perhaps one like we've never seen before where we can see drops of at least fifty percent or more\nIn the depths of the stock market bloodbath after the crash in two thousand eight early two thousand nine the Dow Jones was trading adjust sixty five hundred that was the index level\nIf we returned to those levels again\nThat's a Seventy five percent drop from where we are today so again we're at a critical point one where the stock market still just hasn't made up its mind as to what it wants to do so why risk all your portfolio on something that seems to be just pure chance\nOur message here at Mayfield financial is different\nAt our core is that principle of financial safety safety is our number one concern and priority that your money your savings that you work your whole life to get our protected and that your portfolio has the right amount and the right balance of safe money\nNow do all investment advisors offered this unfortunately no this type of planning or the planning that look to take care of your essential needs first it's often not addressed\nIn this Wall Street dominated financial world that we're in too many investment advisors and individuals try to seek sky high returns and run the odds it's all probability based it's about calculating risk\nAnd hoping that a worst than worst case scenario won't ever happen during your retirement\nTo me and for all of us here at Mayfield financial that simply doesn't work\nI don't like running probabilities when it comes to retirement\nI Want certainties I Want guarantees I Want to retirement plan that puts safety first and where risk isn't measured by what stocks and bonds you have in your portfolio but as measured by their risk of losing your comfort\nYour house your income\nThese types of risks are there real risks we want to consider when planning for retirement\nSo there are many questions to answer when it comes to knowing what to do with your retirement money in your savings and how to best position yourself for the long term so what is the answer\nWell it depends it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met\nAnd it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met and want to continue the lifestyle that we're comfortable with throughout retirement\nSo here at Mayfield financial we are a safety first retirement planning

part of your investment for Foley is all about\nWhen you put safety first you have a plan now to cover your income needs whether those income needs are now or five years from now or ten years from

lemonade stand that you run on the weekends\nIt can provide you with the income that you are going to want to have and that you need throughout your retirement\nThe best example of this comes from what happened in two thousand eight and we are now coming up on the ten year anniversary of one of the worst financial crises this country has ever experienced Wall Street and our economy was brought to the absolute brink\nStocks were in the toilet and for those and kept their hard earned money in Wall Street were decimated\nFinancial retirement plan based on probability and based entirely on Wall street where ruined these so called probability models didn't account for this type of market drop\nAnd people who are retired suffered a loss of income some were forced to sell their homes or what was left of their home value or even return to the workforce\nNow a retirement plan that based on safety that built on guarantees what happened to those during two thousand eight nothing\nThose income

hundred thousand placements total by twenty twenty four\nWow so you ... well ... let me say it again ...\nThank you how now or we're going\nNo no we're we're really focused or were you know business a business approach underlies a lot of what\nWe do and uh you know you can't be effective in business if you don't have goals and I think that same approach applies really well to the nonprofit sector to ... you have to set big aspirational goals and have a plan to get there so we do\nIt then in my my day job I consult with nonprofits and so I'm pretty familiar with this and I'm I'm curious about to me one of the interesting things about the call of duty and damage is Bobby and you you didn't go out there and try and recreate the wheel instead you identify those folks are already doing it\nWho are already good at what they do they're effective they are efficient\nAnd then you give them the the financial resources to get it done\nOn average about how much of those grants per year to each individual organization or is it is hard to say it's all over the board\nNow is the average is about five hundred thousand\nI'm so little little more than that that that's the average but our process or shield distinction process that we go through with the Lloyd helps us to identify those heart those high performers and then on a quarterly basis um those who we've identified as high performers and then made subsequent granted agreements with\nWe reassess so we're we are checking on their performance metrics a quarterly basis or we're looking at how many Veterans Day place what was the cost

very\nYou know for business result I Am always they business results focus impact focused effort but again we're checking up on them a quarterly basis and if they're hitting a fantastic they're not we try to coach a back we try to you know give them the techniques they need or extra resources or connections\nThey'll get them back on track and make them better and I'm really proud to say the organizations we work with\nTend to do better every year um you know I think this focus on result isn't just for us it's for them as well so it helps them you know Dr\nHarder to get those quality jobs for more veterans all the time and you know part of this deal is sometimes you have to\nPart ways with organizations that can't you know can't cut it\nUm but I'm I'm I'm very glad that that's a rare occurrence for us but you know this focus on performance I think is good for every off\nWell and it's not just the job just to ...\nVery glad that that's a rare occurrence for us but you know this focus on performance I think is good for everyone\nAnd it's not just the jobs as the quality of the jobs I mean Ninety three percent of the veterans replacing her full time jobs and his I signed that the top the show the average salary that these veterans are being being pays about twenty seven thousand higher than the national median\nWhat Dan what as an expert who's involved in this I've read some articles recently that debate how to what extent that the military actually prepares veterans for jobs out there in the civilian world I have a client to\nUm it's a mining is a company and this can he would hire veterans all day long they show up on time their discipline they know the command structure they can pass a drug test there's lots of reasons to hire a veteran but are there are some cases were I mean if you witness case where veterans may come out of\nActive duty and they just they've got the right attitude they've got the right values but they need a little bit help getting the right skills for what's in demand a\nHundred percent so um you know what the purpose of the department of defense the fighting when our nation's worst for better or worse not to make civilians and so what will spend you know anywhere from eight to twelve weeks in\nBoot camp for basic training a and we'll spend three days on the way out on career focused activities to get buttons right for the job force and if you have let's say a hundred sailors in a room\nOr with one contractor pushing PowerPoint slides at them all day that is not how you get ready for the workforce you and I know I'm you know having a a ... a perfect resume and throwing it over the wall is not help people get jobs today\nAre so there's a lot more that goes into it so the organizations we support um they they start by doing assessment of an individual to say really answer the question that it's hard for everyone is what do you want to do what do you want to do ... they have tools and approaches to do that then they come they kind of hold off the light with\nThe skills and experience and say is there a fit or\nThey're not as there is not that might be a gap and sometimes that gap can be filled with training or school and sometimes you just have to be honest with them and say you know I understand you want to be a lead guitarist and the ban but you're in a musical talent\nWe need to move on to something else or you know it's it's that kind of you know all kidding aside it's it's a hard topic of conversation that an individual ... house and then once they land on the right place in the right skill set it's about creating the resume that will communicate devalue they have in a way that employers will understand\nThere's a lot of talk about hey employers out to be more understanding I tell our veterans all the time that would be nice but you can't count on it you have to be ready\nYou have to be ready to communicate your value in a way a civilian employer will understand the onus is on you [noise] um that's the nature of a capitalist society right um you know of course we do a lot of work ... trying to give\nEmployers to understand the value of veterans but we tell veterans like you have to more than meet them halfway to be prepared for that there's some wonderful employers out there who do a lot to make it easy for the veteran but you can't count on that\nDo you know and of course are are grants he's also help with interviewing skills and getting that first interview uh and and taking them through the process and for some of them they even spend quite a bit of time checking on them after the fact to make sure that they're succeeding in the civilian workforce\nThat's that's smart that's important and we've got listeners all over the country if there's someone who's affiliated with an organization that is doing this type of work how do they go about getting started in the process with the call of duty endowment\n[noise] yeah so if it's a veteran seeking or transitioning service member guardsmen of reservists was looking for help um we have our veterans support tab on our website\nSo if it's a veteran seeking or transitioning service member guardsmen of reservists was looking for help um we have our veterans support tab on our website so just go to call of duty and dumb and dot org um if it's an employer who is looking to link up with one of these terrific nonprofits who who work for them absolutely free of charge to help them\nUh you know get get veterans has had organization um our our email address is on our website\nUnder info and they should absolutely reach out to us we'll be very happy to connect them we have some grant teams that are really focused on transitioning service members some on guardsmen reservists and some who have geographic focus but we can pretty much cover anyone anywhere\nHow Dan I tell you I have personally contributed to act divisions bottom line um uh you know I'll tell you that and I I've had gas sun in fact some day if we ever chat again I'll tell you about a special forces guy who was uh involved I mean this is an Army Ranger who was getting beat by a fourteen year old and a basement somewhere while he was\nA deployed downrange but I I got to tell you honestly I'm fascinated by your recent fundraiser that the code nation challenge\nI didn't even know there is such a thing as a gaming personality\n[noise] oh yeah so uh you you know a lot of people have a certain age myself included a you know sometimes I find it hard to believe that not only are there people who um\nYou know can play for a living play play video games for a living but there are people who watch people playing video games are living in common uh and it's\nA huge community ah you know twitch a twist on TV\nThe huge streaming network of\nPeople playing games Amazon on some now they spent over a billion dollars for them uh and and I think they probably got a pretty good deal I'm you know there there's some amazing people out there who really do this work and really care about our veteran so every year we do\nYou know kind of a video game equivalent or the twenty first century equivalent of a tough one um so\nWe stream around the clock on twitch um and uh you know are are are these gimme personalities play the game but they they're entertaining they're fun or they talk about the cause and they encourage viewers are and we get millions of viewers to uh to donate and we have sponsors\nOr come aboard and helped as well one of the wonderful things as\nEvery single cent we raise goes directly to these veteran employment grants um because Activision Blizzard covers all of our all the dominance overhead literally every cent we raised in donations goes directly to the program so one of those very fortunate very few nonprofits can say that\nWay and then I I you know I I don't get it but I'm Glad because it's raised in a bunch of money for a very very good cause well we've got to just about a minute left and what what else I mean for ... guys like me do we just go on there and keep buying the games are how else can individuals' help uh the call of duty endowment\nClothes you know there's a number of ways I'm the first thing is you know I tell everyone if you're\nSo you you strike me as a you know as a skipper told me you're a quiet professionals so you're going to have this question but I get to answer it anyway just my darn show Michael I mean out of a hundred and fifty sailors being selected the sailor the year I mean you're you're the guy for twenty Seventeen how does how does that make you feel\nUh well it's definitely I opening because sometimes I'm ... I'm definitely not the only one button a lot of times you do you work on a daily basis weekly basis yearly basis and or you don't really know that people are seeing the work that you're doing\nYou may have fixed a few things are are done a few changes to add men that needed to be done and you feel like you did a good job but you ... at the end of the day you don't know if people even recognized what you did so it's nice to see that\nUh you know people above you actually see what you're doing and they recognize it and they want to show you that appreciation\nYou could have gone to work as a heavy diesel mechanic at caterpillar a opened up your own shop somewhere you still can't obviously you're a young man but what motivated Michael Larson to want to go out on a submarine a hundreds of feet below the surface of the sea\nI mean originally or well yeah so originally um I I had an uncle that was in the navy he was on an aircraft carrier I also had a my grandfather who was in the navy as well so when I joined I wanted to do something different that was more challenging\nAnd luckily my recruiter says hey we got this submarine thing at the time I really didn't\nDo something different that was more challenging and luckily my recruiter says hey we got this submarine thing at the time I really didn't know anything about submarines however that was\nKind of alert to a lot to do something I learned something that I could tell my uncle about and my grandfather about something that they didn't get a chance to do ... you know I guess kind of one album in a way you know\nNow I got to clarify because we get this question quite a bit the the USS Tucson and the all the other Los Angeles class boats\nAre nuclear powered that does not necessarily mean you're you're carrying nuclear weapons your your principal weapons are the good old fashioned torpedoes like I mean better to our Peterson they were in World War two but my torpedoes and then a Tucson favorite the Tomahawk\nOh yes yes so nuclear power to exactly right so that doesn't mean we carry a nuclear warheads or anything like that we just\nWe run out for reactor to you know provide a proposed and really ... a ... year at the sound locks to Peter does that's that's our main main weapon of choice in fact I had the pleasure of going to raise the on here in Tucson and that was a that was an ... actually a very exciting to or\nI learned a lot about stuff that I see every day and I still\nDon't know anything about that one and for our listeners around the country Raytheon facility here in Tucson is\nWhere they manufacture the Tomahawk a which is one of the weapons of the choices carried on fast attack boats in and some of the largest submarines as well even some of the the bigger shooters\nSo you can tell Michael I'm a quiz kind of guy so I got a quiz for you brother sure or can I say shipmates\nI didn't earn it with you yeah never mind I got I got the ball cap on but I haven't heard it with you um there are how many windows on a fast attack submarine\nA well we got one okay [laughter] because now I'm just getting we don't have any windows no windows ... they're not going to withstand the pressure so\nWell okay I I I Believe sure that you have to oh please tell me I I'd like to lose some Bush won on the washer and one of the drier ah that's enough I\nGot is a trick question so\nThe the relationship between the U.S as to how how long have you been on board the boat a bit on board this both for just over three years and how many are submarines were you on the part of this uh this is my second so marine had been stationed on okay and you know we we we pride ourselves that we believe and we've been told the namesake\nRelationship between the USS Tucson in our community is one of the best in the navy you got to hang out with the mayor yesterday you been out the fire chief Raytheon you're going to spend some time with the police department while you're here what what is your honesty evaluation based on your experience on the other boats how does how does Tucson how's that relationship compare\nAnd maybe more importantly why is that important for you and your families and the families of the crew\nA last scene in Tucson that this place has a lot of pride and are having the namesake of the boat and my last book are we there was there was a little bit of pride there\nAnd I never got to go visit however so I couldn't tell you from that perspective or how the people back from where that Bo was named after how they felt for being in Tucson or the warm welcome\nThe the events that were doing it's it's all really eye opening to see that you guys actually you're you're well aware of what we're doing out there on the ocean and you got to take a lot of pride in its makes us want to take more pride in what we do actually\n... I got to say I've I've had the distinct pleasure of going out to see what the USS Tucson on on two occasions and that you know it's one thing to see\nDistinct pleasure of going out to see what the USS Tucson on on two occasions\nAnd that you know it's one thing to see a hunt for Red October which was a hundred percent accurate right a hundred percent whether there's an ocean we know that okay so that that was accurate um but I mean the the amount of respect I have for you and your your fellow\nSubmariners after doing that is is huge I mean you've got a hundred and thirty hundred and thirty eight people in a a tube\nAbout you know as long as a as a football field about maybe three stories high but you are cramped you're always busy you are doing things that are like I said sometimes you are out there by yourself\nAnd there's no there's no cavalry come in but the Tucson as one several awards are not just battle east but a several maybe even accommodations which is a really big deal now nobody can tell me about those missions cars are classified but that's a huge huge deal for what you and your fellow senators are doing out there\nIs a huge deal um\nWe don't honestly think about it on a daily basis of course you know\nUh the last um the last guy had on then you you\nMentioned something about for ... successful business you have to have my goals that you want to maintain a so we do on board the summer and we have personal goals we of command goals that we want to achieve and that's that's all we really think about it on a daily basis we don't think\nAbout the dangers we're having or anything like that we just keep moving forward China better ourselves while you're better man than I'm Michael I tell you when I was on board if it wasn't for all the great food there were certainly I Would have been completely freaking out ladies and gentlemen does your husband below Garcia you know when a member of our military to ... the whole family deploys when we come back\nWe're going to add another special get to the ... we'll be right back\n[noise]\nHatred is on do you want the hottest news from southern Arizona Cullen airing cocktail scene turn it on the menu live hosted by my friend Matt Russell every Saturday from five to six PM on this very station it's the most delicious our on radio and it's only here on one of four one\nK.
