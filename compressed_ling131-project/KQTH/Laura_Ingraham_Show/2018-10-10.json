NBC is Democrat and we want your kids to go out and vote for the Democrats on election day it uh he he starts slow and then builds\nPlus ... think twenty five thousand years ago to school here and ah the Democrats and get all of them to vote for them to be in trouble in the district but if the Democrats don't get all of them to vote or not\nTo be annoying but we're with NBC News and I'm just trying to think that anybody you're going to vote democratic ...\nAnybody how about for Republican ... if they all came out and voted for the Republican he's going to vote [noise] they don't care anybody going to vote in a congressional election in November and\nThey're all stone what do you I mean what are you talking about it's UC Irvine and it's the money\nThey're sitting at a bus stop that

expensive school what she was really saying is um\nYou know money issues with the scope pocketbook issues\nThat uh their self interested in in their own financial straits on you know the Republicans and Donald Trump credit a booming economy where they might actually get a job at something other than a stinking Democrat nonprofits uh destroying civilization or when they got out of college they might get a real job\nNow Jacob the Democrat or who well if you get out if you'll get out and vote for the Democrats then it'll be really bad for the Republican now he doesn't walk up and say if your vote for the Republicans because\nNBC News is completely corrupt to the very narrow of their bone corrupt\nWalks up to two Asian students Asian students at uh UC college I Can't I Can't believe that and I said and and they're like why don't you care to come on don't you want to be a Democrat like me and the people that had bc and support our party and vote for Democrats because we're Democrats

it's very very hard\nUm uh you know short term investments basically savings account and it's going to pay you know one to two percent right now I'm you know and when you do long term investments and then you pull them out short term as you said you can get the market could move down on you and you could actually lose some of the money\nSo um if you want to position some of it in long term investments with the idea that ah the hope that we're going to make some more but the idea that we could actually lose some only take some risk where some of that\nThat's a okay thing to do um\nBut you know basically if you know you're going to need the money and the actual principals very important to you I you know there's not a ... intermediate investment that I'm comfortable with that I use a so I'm pretty much either putting it in a savings account or I'm investing it\nAnd sometimes I'm investing it knowing that I may or may only be in their year and it could be down in a year but I'm going to take that risk just because that's money I can say that I have a little bit of um margin with meaning I can afford to lose a little bit of money\nAnd if that's the case then then it's okay but that that's what we're faced with the ... is in Minneapolis Hi Zack how are you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nI'm a I'm currently in college and I paid cash transfers master and I'm planning on joining the national guard but I'm Wondering if I should continue going to college after I during the national guard or if I should go back home\nPlanning on joining the national guard but I'm Wondering if I should continue going to college after I joined the national guard or if I should go back to my home town and just live with my parents that I'm basically getting paid to go to college\nOkay when you go back to your hometown live with your parents would go to a different college\nYeah I'd go to a university that's within twenty minutes of my parents' house\nAllergen okay if you don't go back home you would stay where you are obviously and you would um can you pay cash\n[noise] ah yeah if I were they were if I can I save the money that I'm

you've got three and a half years to go or whatever\nWell yeah and then I Am actually think sophomore credit so I can graduate in two years\nOkay she got two years to go what are you studying finance okay and why would you stay where you are\n[noise] just because it has a better business school recognition I guess for the state mhm which\nAre the other places water community college or university this local or\nYeah just the local university and not as um right now I'm at the University of Minnesota which is a lot bigger I guess too\nRight okay All right well um if you actually get the knowledge the reputation of the school really doesn't matter much in Ninety nine percent of the jobs up there okay if you actually get the knowledge\nNow if the actual quality of the education is lower [noise] then that's a different discussion okay but I Would not stay someplace merely for its reputation [noise] but there's other reasons that you want to stay in that location you like it there you want to stay in that area\nYou know you've enjoyed the uh the experience of being there and you're willing to work to pay for it if you can pay cash for it I'm OK either way\nThere's not a financial problem either direction or it's just a matter of of where you want your degree to be from where you want to live for the next two years of study and um you know at your age I likely would have stayed where you are because I'm going to work just to be out on my\nOwn uh that's how I watch by you might not feel that way that's okay so you're just trying to what is it what's the pay off of the extra effort and the worst thing that is what you're asking this is the day Ramsey show\nMe tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each has dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nAnd the lights and gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lots of water on\nAnd gas to heat if it's gas heat okay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them right now number three shelter\nNow you pay your rent it doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep

transportation\nYour current on the car and you keep gash in the car now if that takes all your money and you can pay nothing else this month old well\n\nI mean but think about is if you got a place

past those things then it's time to start talking about what we can sell and what we can do to create an income I mean you may have to amputate the taco\nOr you might have a big stinking car payment
