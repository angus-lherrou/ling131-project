their thing\nMost I in in Venezuela you know Hugo Chavez daughter is the richest person in the country of uh of Venezuela and she's apparently worst what three billion dollars because she got dad's money and you know that's a ... I don't know what the president of Venezuela is paid it's probably a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year\nNot to end up with a billions of dollars is is a bit of a stretch and you're right nobody's held to account because who's going to hold them to account was the United nations or a\n... you know this is\nIs a bit of a stretch and you're right nobody's held to account because who's going to hold them to account was the United nations or a ... you know\nThis is this is this is one of the problems I secretly here\nIs that that are in the United states and all these agencies they send money down there and they they they don't they're on the ordered the money yeah you know they they they uh they they open the highway and ... a year later it's full of potholes because they didn't put enough I'm an engineer so I don't know what I'm Talking about it\nBut ah yeah they do that in Chicago too it's kind of the same thing around O'Hare Airport you know [laughter] but you know\nBut here we are you know you you're saying that they left the same thing all these people are good\nThat was that right if they have all these people are bad and if this is neither one they are by people there I I don't disagree with that there are by people that but the vast majority of them\nAre just people that don't have work don't have and they're the mercy of the gangs younger you know the rich don't get a thought that the ... the forget so if you put a little business there\nAnd immediately they come for the uh the war tax they call it so you know how can you live there\nWell let me let me uh so how can you live there I ...

I'm not\nThat old seeing but you say there are bad people in the in the caravan and they're good people not caravan how do we tell them apart\nWell you know there there's a lot a lot of mothers there was a little kid\nWell ... that's not probably not here we're talking about though and and let me also sometimes but you know and I\nI I understand that that the United states cannot let these people in like that I understand that fully are they the one thing that left ... these people as they can come in now if they're fleeing crime and violence ... electrical can give him asylum you know why why why do they have to come all the way here\nRight that I don't know that ... that's been lied there being sold and fully knowing that that Trump got\nIt can be president on a platform ... of stopping illegal immigration yeah and and yet they sell these people they kill these people they're going to let you in a no that's not you know things have changed from ... from one Obama was there\nYeah ah now you say you voted for Trump last time around are you gonna vote for Trump in twenty twenty\nChange from ... from when Obama was there\nYeah ah now you say you voted for Trump last time around are you going to vote for Trump in twenty twenty\nI Would guess I Would see a ... and but you know again I I I their rhetoric is not he's going to end up being the bad guy with the movie\nOf the movie right now that you know oh is that look that's the plan that you're very risky I'm standing there is a little too much for you like I Know you're going to say\nThey're good they they need they need to audit that money that go there and if it's not us for what it was intended for fully ... this this uh caught off of of aid that Trump is doing should have happened you know fifty years ago\nYeah yeah well you're you're you're on your undoubtedly correct about that no let me ask you this Roberta what should happen when the caravan reaches the U.S border what should the United states do what should President Trump do\nWell I think I think at some point some somebody has to the United nations to step in refugee camps somewhere and and uh uh you know kind of a ... ... who who the good guys are and who the bad guys I\nKnow that because they're not going to stop now they're they're already underway here yeah they're not going to stop man and some some are somehow it has to be sorted out who's the good guy who's the bad guy you\nKnow and you know I understand that when I'm at a uh economy or or bad economic\nA physician's in your country orange and I know are not a valid or not if I uh I don't claim from what I understand\nYeah right that's right well now what what I mean you said we should cut off money flowing to these corrupt governments the corrupt government in Honduras the typically but that doesn't really when the day does it that doesn't really change anything does it\nLook with this kind of I Know but because you know the the money\nNo but what if the country I mean what's the country I Would like Honduras to be a great country where people love living I Know a couple of Honduran guys and in DC I'm there because they're the greatest guys in the world they're just great and and I love these guys and I know their families and everything else\nAh how do you turn Honduras in a country into a country that people don't want a fleet which in the end is really the problem isn't it\nYes it yeah that's a that's a country in the\nProcess of other than cutting off your money ...\nThey they look look at it and not a leave a moves in Honduras without the U.S embassy no\nI mean
