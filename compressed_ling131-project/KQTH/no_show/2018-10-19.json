here's the uh it's it goes on and\nOn for pages your printed out it's five pages long because these circling his own naval here again and again\nGlenn Kessler is when he tries to blame Republicans for the Washington Post and the Boston Globe getting everything wrong on the DNA test with Elizabeth Warren bottom line is there is still defending Elizabeth Warren because they're a joke\nGlenn Kessler is a joke the fact checker office at the doctor evil posed as a complete joke it's a Democrat Party it might as well be funded by George Soros himself and and ah today but interestingly they give themselves they give the Washington Post three Pinocchios\nNow if they they great on a curve it should be for\nBut he admits that the news reporting on the DNA test was a complete joke and in the end he circles back and says but it's still shows that she's part Indian and what she's always claimed as true so it it again it makes no sense they he spends four pages saying everything we wrote about it was wrong\nEverything the Boston Globe wrote about it was wrong everything the RMC set about it was wrong although all they did was referring to in New York Times article and the New York times article made a point that the Washington Post now says is wrong because they'll sacrifice from New York Times when they're defending Elizabeth Warren\n[noise] he types on behalf of his party which is the Democratic party of the United states America it's a press release for Elizabeth Warren masquerading as a fact check at I\nHis party which is the Democratic party of the United states America it's a press release for Elizabeth Warren masquerading as a fact check at a news organization which it has in fact not after being done by President Trump puts all Trump's fault this is how it begins Senator Elizabeth Warren deem mass\nReleased the results of a DNA test on October Fifteen that indicated she had native a Native American ancestor now and again that they they they dance and skate around all of the fun facts that don't contribute to or funny cause\nThe result which identified Native American DNA from six to ten generations ago were immediately misinterpreted\nAnd he said and then he says that they were misinterpreted by the Boston Globe they were misinterpreted by the Washington Post they're all real smart they're they're the smart next that way a way to keep our ear to the ground for what they have to say because they know they're using the old noodle all the time up there it started with the Boston Globe report which initially indicated the test showed\nShe was at best one thirty second Native American and possibly just won five hundred twelve Native American\nAfter confessing twice twice to a math error they confess twice to two different math errors but but let's not get technical you're just a news reporter right\nThe globe corrected the numbers to one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American\nThat would translate to between Ninety eight point forty four percent and Ninety nine point nine percent not Native American well that's right and that's the correct interpretation of this right isn't it oh not so fast\nThey are and see now he wants to politicize instead of making it about the truth the RMC then issued a news release directing reporters to a two thousand fourteen New York times report that said European Americans\nHad genomes that were on average Ninety eight point six percent European point one nine percent African and point one eight percent Native American\nSo it sounded like Warren had less Native American DNA than the average European American yeah that's what it sounds like 'cause if you look at the New York times piece in the Boston Globe piece that's what you might surmise if you whipped out your bum are calculator and did a little busy work with your digits there I'm thinking\n[noise] we even issued meaning the New York for the Washington Post we even issued a tweet along these lines\nAt a moment when the globe still indicated the range was between one thirty second and one one thousand twenty fourth now he just got it for a brief time it's true they only corrected the second\nFigure and not the first figure because they're not very smart this is this is the conclusion that must be drawn from all of this and I I draw that conclusion the day this came out because I started questioning the figures immediately as well and as did everyone else except the geniuses at the Boston Globe the Washington Post the New York times\nSo in any case the the Washington Post he goes on and on for four pages and in the end he gets to the parochial tests and you'll never guess that it's mostly somebody else's fault because tear liberal ... you know\nThey said Pinocchio tests were not trying to defend Warren's decision to release the test\nJust to set the record straight about what the test shows the media bungled today interpretation of the results first they bungled the math and the results than they bungled the interpretation and and but all in favor of Elizabeth Warren let's not lose sight of that\nAnd then ... opponents used the uninformed reporting meaning\nAnd and but all in favor of Elizabeth Warren let's not lose sight of that\nAnd then ... opponents used the uninformed reporting meaning the Washington Post the Boston Globe the New York times\nTo undermine the test results even further oh by introducing the New York times article from a couple of years ago we fell into this trap as well as the Washington Post confessing to the\nFalling into the trap and work too quick to send out a tweet not deleted said out there that don't they just to delete their mistakes that they don't correct them\nThat made an inaccurate comparison we should not have relied on media reporting before tweeting [laughter]\nThey the Washington Post says they should not have relied on media reporting and you know what they're right there right about that they should not have allowed on a relied on media reporting by the Boston Globe or by themselves and and you know what Glenn\nI don't make the same mistake every day I avoid that Mr that that pitfall that trap is one that I'm aware of every day when I got out of bed I'm Still rubbing the sleep out of my eyes when I say I wonder what the Washington Post is going to lie about today and then\nI pick up my paper which lands outside my door and my best girl and I laugh out loud and how it all to be asked that you're a phony baloney newspaper publishers every day\nBut keep in mind that the conclusion here is that the Washington Post said we should not have relied on media reporting\nFor words were never spoken I think that Glenn Kessler should there should be the Glenn Kessler award\nAnd on the loose ... block it will say we should not have relied on media reporting and and that would be the Glenn Kessler word sidewalk sharp edges horns Native American DNA as identified in the test may not be large\n\n... it may be one one thousand twenty fourth and it's not Native American because they can't compare to Native American which he admits and page four of this essay that he wrote on behalf of Elizabeth Warren\nAnd and we know what the we know what it is I got it right don't worry about me Glen\nI got it right because I didn't depend on your phone reporting because I read you every day\nAnd I know that you're not only crooked you're not very smart you get the math wrong and then you interpret it wrong then you change one statistic without changing the other statistic which means you're really incompetent when it comes to basic statistics that I knew a long time ago that I could depend on you\nWeren't there to identify the test may not be large but it's wrong to say it's as little as one one thousand twenty fourth\nNo it's not no no you're wrong again I I mean these people are just incompetent and intelligent unserious\nParty hacks that will say anything to do anything and when they're caught being wrong they come out to be wrong again he just explained\nHigher up in the piece that it is perfectly fair and square to say that on the low end is one one thousand twenty fourth those are her numbers that she issued summer expert Carlos Bustamante who is a revered he's not really but they claim is because he did all is with Warren's a test and and uh\nAnd and so here we go it's wrong to say as little as one one thousand twenty fourth or that it's less than the average European American no it's not\nIn fact reading your own piece ... that is in fact a perfectly reasonable conclusion to counter now it may be as high as one sixty fourth\nAnd it may be as little as one one thousand twenty fourth those are the numbers Glen there in your own pace see if we can sort this out in your little brain and maybe tomorrow you can come back with a correction of your correction of your misinterpretation\nNice to see if we can sort this out in your little brain and maybe tomorrow you can come back with a correction of your correction of your misinterpretation of your misunderstanding of statistics and sex\nSo they end up with this three Pinocchios all around including to our tweet your tweet it's not just your tweet it's all your reporting it's your home and and now it's this idiotic pays which once again misinterpret misunderstand send misrepresenting the facts so thanks for that Glenn you're quite a guy\nThere it is and they give themselves the Washington Post give themselves three Pinocchios but they think they're sharing it with the Republicans because the Republicans pointed to a New York times article which the Washington Post says\nThey don't know what they're saying because the New York times article is fine and when you compare it to that Elizabeth Warren claim you come up with the accurate numbers which Glenn Kessler is trying to muddy the waters on because he's a crook\nAnd he's a Democrat water boy hey water boy I let's go to
