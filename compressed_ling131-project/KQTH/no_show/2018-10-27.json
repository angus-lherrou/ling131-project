I'm going to be getting ready to sell this sucker since I you know use it for work at ... and I won't be doing that anymore and I'm Wondering it's got a ... about three years old I'm almost lifted on it I'm Wondering what the minimum I might need to\nTake for it is do you have an idea what that might\nBe a your vehicle is over for two fifty percent of the bullet proof put on it\nI ... you can look at the ... value and I I Would look into book value but\nIn the book value on it doesn't really apply to the older diesels that's been taken care of and have the bullet proof zone it knowledge stuff\nYeah I have the inspectors replaced too at the same time about I don't know four years ago mhm three years we should be a good runner should be hired on it's\nIt's fine I'm just thinking well\nA book that he doesn't really let you put in for it you know bullet proof and [noise] you know specifics heavy duty stuff like\nThat with the price of a new diesel does okay\nRA in Tucson, Arizona like like my own six okay I think they're going to like ten grand and I've got two hundred and one thousand miles on it ain't no way I'm selling it for ten grand imam Eighteen I might do Nineteen but I'm not ...\n... a good vehicle yours the way you've done it and keep up with it\nAnd go you can there's all sorts of books out there like ... and you can Google and in fact you can just Google it says what is the\nSuggested price to shale a two thousand and four two fifty with a hundred and Eighteen K on it\nWith a bullet proof on it but I just put it right into Google and see what your average prices are should give you three price range or another thing you can do is call Lynn's alter brokers at six to eight Seventy five hundred well I talked to Dana\nOkay [noise] and that's going to be the big the big killer is heat there's only two things going to take out her transmission one is just pure drag racing the other one is heat and he is generated from towing day I've done blown up transmission showing a no no what brings them out\nBut you have a a good unit you keep your service opponent follow the recommendations that in your Emanuel\nUnder severe duty Tucson is a severe duty shady the south West is a severe duty city west Texas is severe duty ignore the normal duty and go to the severe duty and your protect your vehicle\n[noise] okay okay\nAll right and what the other question I had was the same shot that was telling me I Need a slush says that I Need shocks all around so I kind of looked at them myself because I've done shocks they're not\nActors or mhm but in in the front it it almost to me I mean I'm not a mechanic but [noise] you know just can do little things sure that\nIt almost looks like a a small ... ... in there and I'm like okay so then I kind of Google that around and I couldn't find out if it's a strut or if it's just a shock with call over around ... call over yeah [noise] so is\nThere is have let me ask you another question now All right on your front end do you have any weird tire where in other words you or your tires wearing flat or do they have feathers on them\nUm you know which means you can rub your hand across in just feel like somebody sitting there with a little file against your hand is you go across the top of the\nCar and I don't know\nUm you know which means you can rub your hand or crossing you feel like somebody sitting there with a little file against your hand as you go across the top of the tire\nFeathering just kind of normal you know like from turning right or left you know just normal driving out on the outside just a little bit yeah uh but nothing that I Would consider abnormal 'cause I have seen feathering tire sure and they had seen like ... where are we are not but I don't have anything\nAbnormal like that that I consider abnormal so I think okay what do I really need shots are not\nAlright when's the last time you had that thing into shop and had to run in the land that they give you a computer printout telling you that it yes it is a land or no it's not they give you a before and after like Brian pulled her desk\nI haven't because I haven't noticed any like usually when I could get to get an alignment\nI'll start to notice like you said on the tires or I'll start to feel something kind of pull on the steering wheel and how to sell anything abnormal so I haven't taken it to get on an island I've just been doing oil changes for the lab huh you know for a while\nWhen you stop it on the road you take it out on the back roads you knew you get up about forty miles an hour\nWith no traffic around you any place and you lock that son of a gun down hold it will both hands lock it down and see if it's ducking or diving in front end because all the way it's going to transfer to the front in shock people when I'm Bad it we'll let you know because you will die to the week said\nOkay okay ah I think it a little premature on that or however it is you start watching your shocks and stretch at sixty thousand miles and then you go from there the the five point seven does not way as much as a Cummins Diesel okay\nAnd my daughter my granddaughter I was in Monticello Mick I'm Arkansas so we took it down way out of town about an hour to go this fancy barbecue place\nComing back we're cruising along and I we were talking about ... years in the road and stuff like that and so she is running about fifty mile an hour and his fifty five zones so she was driving like supposed to pay attention\nOf a sudden she goes to the break to search bringing it down and I watched the vehicle as we were coming down because I was wondering you know we put new shocks on that thing and I want to see if they're still there because you knew shocks replaced about two and a half years ago\nAnd she come all the way down the abs work perfect pitch it was squeal a little didn't late goats and stop it is so they BS was working for perfect a break check and she bumped the deer\nThat's how far she brought it down all the way down to where just bumped the deer and it looked like the deer said well what was that all about and then he tried it all on off so we got lucky there it stopped straight without the ducking and diving\nShocks you can ride around you get used to them but you don't know what you're going to do until you run across an emergency and you have to lock that son of a gun down\nAnd most of the time when you have to lock them down like on the freeway when everybody run in Seventy five eighty five mile an hour and then they lock it down in front of you also you see the brake lights come on you get after it and then you start pulled into the right hand side are you up to the right and ... back to the left\nSo do the oh basic common knowledge thing just go get out there on a on a on a road when nobody around on the ... not on dirt road 'cause we won't work\nBut goat and just jump on that break and hang don't don't pump abs system put your foot on a break and hold it and give it a chance for the electronics to work\nAnd see what you've got I doubt very seriously or you could have but I'd\nIt can hold it and give it a chance for the electronics to work\nAnd see what you've got I doubt very seriously or you could have but I ... I don't know do you live on a dirt road no okay so do you like to hit a this another reason I'd like to you to get him for an inland his because nobody can drive around Tucson without hitting a pothole\nI hit a particular disease is no doubt about that\nWell I Would have this thing checked to make sure and when they're checking if you take it too good will enrich shop they will check your shocks at the same time we used to be able to do a bounce remember back in the day when you use to bounce a car and see if okay if it goes down and comes back up and settled back within a bouncer and a half then shocked good\nUntil I met a shock manufacture\nAt the same as show in Las Vegas and he explained to me that there's about a three aids part of that shock that runs most of the time\nThat it will wear out you can hit a heavy bump and you can't tell it but driving down the road that shock is not working for three eighths of an inch owner shank\nSo you know he said you you have to test them and and see what they are but you have to see where the loose bodies and um [noise]\nBut I Would think you know if you want to replace shocks catcher sale [noise] get yourself where you go to for one and keep in mind the right ah I see people replaced the front shocks and I see people replaced the rear shocks how many times do you hit a bump\nWith a front together and then the rear together only when you're going over a speed bump a little faster than you should ... if you hit a chuckle on the right front it's going to probably hit it on the right rear [noise] and so it breaks a shock or a ruptured a shock\nYou should have some fluids coming out of it or you can break up out of a shock\nOkay why I looked and I didn't see any fluids coming out of it ... and that's where the shop said that they said that he will but I didn't see any fluids so I'm thinking okay well do I really\nNeed to show emotion shock loads now when you first start to Lincoln comes out clear\nOr to be so playing you really have to pay attention to it you probably have to use a flashlight what I recommend you take a white paper towels\nAnd reach up in there and just wipe around the top of the shock you know where the ... on the shock go to the top of the shock and the bottom of the shock and see if you've got any clear fluids if you have clear fluids on in your leaking all of the flu it doesn't shock is keep it cool\nThat's not shocking it just keeps the shock cool it's telling you that eventually it's going to leak out and then the shock is going to start seizing up or a heating up going bad\nOkay All right All right well I appreciate all the advice and and I I'm grateful that is they have this show on and on the weekend\nWell I Hope you get your transmission flushed if you knew it flushes sixty nine I wouldn't [noise] okay and um because you don't do you don't qualify to have it ... right now if you brought in the shop with prompts me\nYou know you can do it if you really forces too and I've had people make me do it but ah now if it was ... I don't think so we take my granddaughter's oh six dodge and it's got to five point seven in it and we flush out thing about every thirty six thousand miles\nBut I also know six and she's also in Monticello, Arkansas and I don't want anybody else to touch it so we just pay attention and we check it and then the last time we checked it it ... it was it was fun and so we said okay we're going to take a fifty thousand miles [laughter] so and she is over a hundred\nIt was it was fun and so we said okay we're going to say could fifty thousand miles [laughter] so and she is over a hundred thousand on it so it fifty thousand miles you get a check just cause parks where out\nOK okay All right so good luck with that thank you very much I appreciate the help and the advice All right have a good weekend you too Bye bye Bye bye [noise]\nGood point good point on transmission pleasures if you've been listening to show for the twenty nine years I've been doing this show\nOr last year [noise] if it's liquid in a vehicle change it\nIt's designed to change I don't know any liquid that is a lifetime I look at a lifetime who's lifetime five years hundred thousand miles you know what's a lifetime of if you're going with it or you take it up here to Flagstaff you throw in a trailer weighs about seven thousand pounds I won't tell you something you agreed to meet at transmission\nYeah this is a link on and off like a like a cop car disconnected the horrors that to hear it\n[laughter] and the van runs a great even sees that works out for ten years a thing\n[laughter] well you got a good one so now you just can't figure out the alarm system we see a lot of alarm problems that are all owned the older than age and I to be honest with you I don't know what the guys the number one thing or finding with them but the shop does they know exactly what it is\nSo I don't know what side of town your own or where you're at where are you at\n... I live in dense with the cars here in Tucson and I'm closer to your shop\nOK we'll bring back coal weighed at eighty four oh two one seven and tell me and he gets thing in that far is that it's possessed because the alarm system keeps going on and off when nobody's trying to steal it\nHe also gave me a Cadillac I guess I'll pick up the early nineties low mileage that for ten years I Want to see if I Can't get that thing going\nWell is it what is it a big Cadillac full size yet this little ...\nYou're going to love that I was going to be around it's like you haven't had quite a few years [noise] yes it can be fixed but just take same precautions you did it fired and also make sure all the fluids or changing that lose the engine\nExactly and it's surprising mechanic that went over there with me I didn't watch this they fire up and up if I didn't have the necessary and I\nWell you got some garbage feeling and I'll guarantee that\nOh yeah see I got them out first thing why even try and put a battery in very\nWell you've done it before you're you're right on spot I appreciate it Jerry already have a good one thinks they're All right\nBye bye a lot of\nAlarm systems uh I run into one you a while back in Arkansas and it they said what's this little thing right here and I said that somebody took off and after market alarm because they put after market alone they put the a power supply to the wrong location\nA so if you have a a Carl army goes on and off like that yeah sometimes it's something simple to fix sometimes you just have to take the darn thing out depends on what the value your vehicle is that Ninety nine dodge caravan is not going to be worthwhile to age two thousand sixteen two thousand fourteen dodge pick up\nA car alarms are good you know most of the groups out there are no doubt about past most of them [noise]\nUm so if you have a GPS and it's a little harder they may steal your vehicle but you can always find it\n[laughter] if it's anything left of it but I'm In a\nCar alarms are nice they're nice or you know I've got 'em all my stuff and but I have a different set on my dodge than you do I have a alarm it has a little button on it takes one thousand one hundred combination to bypass that\nOr you can put the key back on the cat back on top of an effort right off I can leave the doors unlocked you can go in I can leave the keys indignation you turn the key on listen to the radio you can do everything but you can't start it you can't drive it\nSo that that's what I like specially on search and rescue and these outlying areas okay let's go to Dick Dick good morning\nMarch ... got a question on tire so I Know the drill pretty much all I've got a shuttle eight or nine year old a ... page on an SUV seasonal rushing in town about six months or years showing the cars Raj um they don't have insurance\nIt's a little restaurant in town about six months or your shoulder cars garage [noise] um [noise] they don't even show up Mike Rowe crack on the side ... I Know the drill says there should be replaced but would you replace him a little ...\nWhat do you do with it what do you all\nAre ride both around calving occasionally trips up to ... once in a while to Southern California\nAll right take your vehicle when you when you get off the phone or since my programs over used equipment nuts Fifteen minutes but I'm\nTaking vehicles going to be a nice sunny day out today turn the wheels to the left side that'll be the driver's side you get out you go around and you look in between the treads\nAnd you see if there's any cracks on that thing between the treads now one way to keep these things last my dad used to drive until they blow up\nBut the the way you can find it when it's been garage and setting there is one they're setting okay that's not good they need to be laying down and not setting up\nBut they're setting up because of your own your car and the stern Karl sideways [noise]\nSo you look inside and you you you look to see if there's any cracks between the tread running around the tires\nShe if you can spot any little ones squat down and take a good look at it and make sure now the reason I'm telling you this because if it has those cracks I'm a chicken I Will not drive it to the Knicks I Will drive it around Tucson until the go flat because I've got access to\nYou know frontier toe in and you know I can get it handled Michelin is a good tired it's solved rubber compound\nUh I've driven them until the side walls was so hard I had to replace it because they started chunk in all owned the tread itself they started actually breaking off the tire dries out\nSo that's the big thing that you got to watch and when they start checking out replace them don't even question that just go replace all four of them okay\nBut if it's just got to cracks in between they are not designed to cool the tire they are ... they're dried out\nAnd it's time to take a good look at him before you hit to sustain runs like me here to San Diego here to Las Vegas or I don't like go from here to Phoenix 'cause wrote temperatures\nWhen it's hot outside you well you got a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty degree wrote temperatures and they're going to dry out really fast if they've already started drying out and that's when your tires are normally come apart\nThat and if it's low air low air pressure the air pressure has to be right on them have to keep them up so that the the sad balls and wires\nDoesn't create additional heat inside the tires\nCrashed and they had no cracks no cracks not if you're going to take to Phoenix you can drive hey you can drive it with the\nHalf the trade coming off around who's on as long as you drive around fifty mile an hour but I had too many tires come apart that looked\nPerfect\nThey were where dated the Goodyear recommends you know four to five years I think they moved they say four to five years depending on how what what is used for where it's a house how its house or how the humidity is humidity huge humidity is a huge factor on these things but\nIf you see any of the little cracks running between or don't kid yourself I'd back it up about a half a foot soccer check the rest of the ... if you have any bigger ones come in because they're not going away and why you got to turn to laugh go round look at the right front\nAnd if you've had your tired rotated at the same time they're ... just like the ...\nAnd why you got to turn to laugh go round look at the right front and if you've had your guard rotated at the same time than the backs of looked just like the ... except you don't have to get down and crawl around the vehicle look at it\nOkay tell all I've done I've done that and also there's a reason and cash the perfect ... years to get rid of them\nIt's I because I Can't tell you what to side walls are done I don't know what to dredge done I don't know how to drive they actually are you know I bought a Mustang off the east coast brought it in got it in my brother told me he actually drove the carpet it up on the trailer in North Carolina sent it to me\nAnd we backed it off and it tires from twenty foot looked like they were brand new and they weren't brand new about Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd when it backed off the truck\nAnd I put it on frontier going to send it to my home the tires when frontier drop it off for me the tire tread on three\nThree tires were over half way off and the fourth tire had just started at about an eighth of the circumference off and they look just perfect setting on the trailer there were no cracks on the sides either and it was inside a little garage in Carolina where all the moisture but to come apart the gang\nI don't like driving I don't you change the terms I rode lately\nLow fat God yep\nWell you want to continue that right\n[laughter] I Would not I I I'm just paranoid retires because I just come off a twenty six hundred mile trip seen a lot of stuff that people could have prevented and some of the cars in Arkansas they don't really take good care of those and um but you know in Texas on the freeways knock on wood\nAh the only ones that are saying they were all phone side roads and stuff like that are truckers truckers oh there's those alligators those big alligators oh by the way if you're driving down the freeway don't hit one of those causing do a lot of damage to the vehicle\nAnd ah but they were all over the place I mean taxes was just just they had\n... all everywhere and you say you spend most of your ... they don't have any chuckles and freeways but they do have those alligators which I'd rather have a chuckle when an alligator 'cause that thing likes to roll up under the bottom side and beat the crap out of your vehicle\nSo yep a there that's my personal and professional opinion on your tires are as a reason they put a date on him\n[noise] [noise] oh it's so good\nSo you can run around town as long as you want to because you've got access to a two tier change or somebody if something happens but I don't freeway Seventy five miles an hour\nThat's our gift to you we've been doing it for about twenty five years we want to keep you out for

everybody\nWas a little bit on edge yesterday just trying to get everything finished that we could open up a those new half the warnings so it looks ... yeah yeah and so I think people will be very pleased to see um the the way things have changed over there [noise]\nUm so if you have any questions or comments especially regarding kitty cats and they're interesting behaviors give us a call here at the studio\nSeven five one one oh four one that's one of the reasons that we have carry here because that's what she\nWas she helps to work with our little furry feline friends and some of the interesting behaviors that they might develop and some of the not so pleasant to behaviors that they might develop over time depending on what's going on in their home environment is an alien trainer yes she is [laughter]\n[laughter]\nShe shaking your head at your mark [laughter] so anyway Kerry you have a background that has allowed you to actually work with specific behaviors and you've also been in a very veterinary field for a little while to subpoena give us\nAnd our listeners a little bit of detail about how you got started in dealing with kitty cats and your veterinary technician background and now your degree for dealing with behaviors\nYeah so cats have always been something that have been a part of my life we actually started fostering kittens when I was in middle school um we had hundreds of kittens come through my house my parents and very grateful that they let me have that adventure\nUm 'cause they gotta deal with strays and Farrell and moms and babies and bottle feeding and kind of that whole world I'm so so much fun when I was younger\nUm and then I started as a veterinary technician really as soon as I could get a job on and that was so much fun working in the veterinary field and seen\nThe different things in there and the medical problems and also behavioral issues at the vet clinic as well um and then from there I decided to get my masters in companion animal behavior and counseling\nAnd open my own business and cats are really just my passion not a lot of people want to work with cats they do think there aliens\n[laughter] a lot of [laughter] a lot of these kind of\nYou know they think they're just so independent and they can't be trained and you know all these ... here all day long about you've trained cats of what you can actually change their behavior\nAnd you know all these miss that I hear all day long about you've trained cats of what you can actually change their behavior and you know I just tell people you can change anything ... you just have to find the right motivation for it so yeah it's it's definitely my passion and it's it's a job that I just love it's not even really a job\nAnd yeah and when you love to do something that really isn't a job anymore and so and that way people can see how passionate you are about what you do because for you this is\nYour life it's fun and exciting and out of it may be stressful sometimes but it's not a negative stress it's going to be one of those more positive stresses that you're like I'm going to be able to accomplish this and be able to help this particular cat and their family get through whatever the issue is [noise]\nAnd so you've also recently started doing a workshop I saw on your website that you had done a little\nLike group like twenty people are so that got together and and you were doing a little bit of teaching on what some of these cat behaviors are and talking to people that are in a shelter environment trying to see what they could do to help improve the adaptability of some of these kitty cats so how did that little lecture series go for you for them was it helpful\nPlus I'm back to ... talk and we are talking with Cary see with perfect behavior solution\nBack to pet talk and we're talking with Cary see with perfect behavior solutions and that is P. U. R. R.\nS. E. C. T. so if you have any questions for her please call us at seven five one one for one or you can certainly contact her through email and she has a wonderful website that will give you all sorts of information about what she does and the\nTypes of common behavioral problems that we can see with cats and that's one thing I Want to talk about now during the few minutes we have before we have to take our break at the half\nIs some of the more common behavioral issues that you run across and that people are calling you about and saying how in the world do we solve this problem with our cat\nThe number one issue and I actually have I think three new clients and the past week that I'm Talking about this as being outside the litter bottoms\nAnd it is one of the most common issues that I come across and it's really not a simple fix like a lot of people would think um you know there's so many reasons it did it start as a medical thing and that's always the first thing whenever there's any inappropriate elimination\nFirst thing we do as a ... check whether that do we have a you ... do we have crystals do we have pain 'em 'cause that can be a huge deterrent for using the litter box if there was ever any sort of pain getting into the litter box and things like that um so yeah that's it that's a huge one\nYeah and when I have clients come in with that as a primary complaint it's usually going to be one of my longer appointments having to discuss with them all the ins and outs of the medical side of things and then the behavioral side of things and what are we going to do to try to correct as behavioral issue that as you said can often start off as a medical issue [noise]\nSomething has given them an aversion to that litter box and all of a sudden it turns into a behavioral issues even though you may have solved that original version issue\nAnd now you've got a cat it was like well I was being outside the litter box and everything was fine and I'll just keep being outside the litter box but\nIt is a very frustrating problem cat here and it's really hard smell to get out of a house and that's [noise] pardon me one of the reasons why people are going to say I got to fix this problem because that's not where I Want my cat to be eliminating they need to be using their litter box that we can properly clean the house\nAnd so I Know I have multiple things in my tool box what are some of the things that you will used to talk to clients about to get the key to get back in the box\nSo usually besides you know making sure it's not medical the first thing I Do is look at the environment\nAnd making sure we have enough litter boxes seeing what type of literature we're using what's the placement of those litter boxes actually had a client I'm a couple of months ago that her cat was outside the litter box for three years\nOh my goodness I Know I was like oh you're a saint for for this cat and\nYou know most people are like a week and they're like I'm done\nI'm you know we talked about the policemen of the litter box and realize that it's the only litter box in this house was at the end of this long hallway that the dog to sleep in front of ... and the cat does not get along with the dogs because the dogs chase her\nSo why is she going to go down that way where are these scary these are guarding it when she has to go to the bathroom of course she's going to find a different place to go I'm so taking a look at environment is a huge\nHuge factor and just trying to get into the head of the kitty like okay what could be possible stressors and that's another thing too is stress can be a huge factor um a lot of people you know even though it's not stressful for you and I it can be really stressful for a kitty like when you go out of town\nFactor um a lot of people you know even though it's not stressful for you and I it can be really stressful for a kitty like when you go out of town and the schedule changes and things like that your cat is never mad\nAt you and being outside of the litter box to get back at you I hear that all the time is you know they just aren't spiteful creatures they don't have that ability I'm Sorry but humans are really the only ones that have\nThat [laughter] [laughter] we don't take advice [laughter] if we should not be taking you to argue [laughter] I was a good\nRecord barbecues things we do think about the editor of cats but it it affected my dog as well but\nUh if you had a litter box in the laundry room mhm address them it's a pretty hard period or sonic sound mhm but you as a human might not think about but maybe that's why the customer use now looks so thinking about things try to get as you said of the head of your ...\nOr even having plug in ... around the litter box you know those smells tell us they might they might smell pleasant but they can be really strong for the kitty and a lot of people put them or right over the litter box thinking like oh I'm going to drown out the smell and it's like\nNo you're just going to get that from somewhere you don't want it sounded the spray would've goats yeah yeah I get a retired scary too that you are a startling even for me when I Walk\nBy them back [laughter] and all of a sudden it is [laughter] so I Can't blame them for that one yeah unless you were\nMentioning sometimes what type of litter so ... is a real big thing for cats to as you might not realize that you get the scented cat litter so that you can try to cover up the smell of whatever they're putting in that box and your cat might not like that or the texture of what the litter is like there are so many different options out there today that you sometimes have\nTo play around with what type of literature they might actually like and given the multiple options at the same time to go to and then you can see which\nOne does my cat litter box buffet as [laughter] which might be a little expensive upfront\nBut in the long run if you can find that litter that really does it for your kitty and they liked digging in it and they like going to the bathroom in it you know they we all have texture preferences and so to our cats\nAnd so you need to find something that works and then also littered that some people don't realize that sometimes cats like to dig a lot in their litter box and if they are hitting the bottom of the box and they can't dig anymore they're like well why do I want to go here I Want to dig\nAnd the other thing to to remember is sometimes what's working might change and you don't like the same things for your entire life\nBut we often expect our cat you know you start with clay letter from day one and you expect him for the next Twenty years to use that\nAnd sometimes their preferences change especially as they get older and you might need to switch to a different type of litter and that's okay you know don't have that expectation that everything's going to remain the same for the entire life of that cat\nLitter box size depth and whether or not it's covered is another big thing and the new thing out there it's not totally new but it's having these electronic litter box is clean themselves after your cat goes to the bathroom well we already talked about the drier that can make noise when these litter boxes are not quiet [laughter]\nAnd they're often small yes they are very small I look at them um the original one rectangular shape box that had a rake that went from one end to the other and dumped it into a receptacle at the end and then would break it back\nA not a very large litter box at all maybe for a kitten it might work but once you have a large sometimes Fifteen twenty pound adult cat [noise]\nUh not a very large litter box at all maybe for a kitten that might work but once you have a large sometimes Fifteen twenty pound adult cat\nAnd the amount of debris that they can put in that litter box and they don't work as well and now the newer one um that his round again it's very hard for a normal sized adult cat to fit in there and be able to get that stretching behavior that they want to be able to dig a cat's if you've ever watched them\nMost most people don't want to watch their cats go to the bathroom if you've ever watched them in the litter box there do you do or maybe makes me worry a little bit [laughter] I haven't really had a problem than another box I have to it\nSo they are they dig they sniffed around they turn they dig in another spot they sniff that they turn I mean there's a lot of motion that goes along before they actually decide to eliminate in that box\nAnd then it's the do I cover it up or not question because I have some that do in some that don't kind of look at and go and get out of the box and other ones are obsessive compulsive about trying to cover it up so much so that now they're going up the walls trying to get the wall to come down to cover up their litter or their their mess in the box so\nEach cat has their own very specific behavior and their likes and dislikes about using that Fox and so we have to cater to the kitty cat mhm\nDoes that extend to also where the opening of some kind of want to come down into the litter box versus ones that go into the side you also have to consider that\nAnd that's been very popular thing these days to is having not top opening one ... on and yeah we have to consider that especially if we have older cats\nUm because sometimes they can't jump you know they're starting to develop arthritis and things like that and so jumping in and out of the box becomes really difficult for them\nAnd it may not be obvious to a pet owner watching the cat just walk around the house that oh well maybe they can get on to her off of this litter box\nBut it actually is a problem we see it more frequently than you might think and these cats that will be inside the box the poop outside the box\nThat's an interesting one for most people because they're used to it being reversed but that's usually going to be our older cats who to get in the box and to actually engage all of the pelvic muscular Cher and bones associated with actually having a bowel movement hurts\nAnd so ... is easy it's more of a passive process for some of these cats were actually having about movement is more of an active process and so then they start going\nThis is a lot of pain associated with being in this litter box to go to the bathroom and so yes we are going to have those cats who have an aversion to using the litter box to death of Kate when they're starting to get old and arthritic and that's something that some people kind of forget\nThat happens to them to you know us getting down on the toilet sometimes if we're sort is hard and so you can imagine if that's the same for your cat or your dog\nI Will say I'm so sad to admit that I have my first ever kept by\nAbout a month ago and it's actually passing clients cat um and it's this cat that we've been working with on his behavior because he gets so stressed out would have humans leave\nThat he just whenever I come in the house he just shocks me around the house and it's a very stressful situation for him and it's funny because I posted about my cat fight on line and it's it's funny it's his mouth looks huge it looks like the panther but [laughter]\nYou know I had a lot of negative comments from people like oh my gosh what a terrible cat what a bad cat no he was so stressed out that his parents had were gone and I'm the stranger coming in his home invading his space I have to go in there to feed him\nAnd I have to walk towards him because that's where the litter boxes and you know stress is a huge reason that these cats become aggressive and it's usually not true aggression in the fact\nThat I Want to fight you I'm so mean it's usually I'm scared ... and this is how I defend myself by lashing out because I don't know what else did you because you keep coming towards me\nOn so a lot of that we can start young and I love kitten kindergarten um because you know we start with introducing them to new people\nI'm getting them used a different types of people people coming in and handling them and just building up again that positive association with these kind of scary strangers\nUm another thing that people do when they get a cat again we just throw 'em in the house you get a dog first thing you do sign up for puppy classes or dog classes take 'em to happy hour you do\nThe thing that people do when they get a cat again we just throw 'em in the house you get a dog first thing you do sign up for puppy classes or dog classes take him to happy hour you do things with them ... you get a cat there just in the house\nRight you don't you don't have people over and you're not like I just got this you know you want to come over and hang out with it like if you get a puppy every everybody coming right yeah and you didn't you know that's cool I'm not a cat person I don't want to you know new yeah if you get a new\nCat you don't have kitten kindergarten in the area well let me get [laughter] let's work on that\nUm that invite your friends over work on positive handling work on having different types of people in the home people wearing sunglasses and\nYou know different types of shoes and slowly dresses and things like that I might not be the norm so they get used to having those different types of people and always pair it with something really high value genetically food\nUm a lot of people you know they're like oh my cat doesn't he treats I'm not talking about temptations I'm Talking let's do some chicken let's do some salmon with just a baby food meat based baby food is usually super high value so it can quickly tell build up that positive association between\nYou know scary thing and hey scary thing really wonderful thing a lot of them we want them to come back\nYeah and so it takes time and patience with these cats too um but there can be some situations that are hard to deal with where the cat for whatever reason has decided that it has realized that can get away with us and getting away with behavior\nUnfortunately ends up reinforcing that behavior and that pets mind and so we have to work on\nHelping them understand that this behavior is inappropriate and what kind of re directions do you try to do and we have a cat who may be going out and flooding are biting at somebody and it looks like they're now seeking you out to do it [laughter]\n[noise] a lot of um what I recommend number one is management um because we don't want that the more the cat repeats that behavior of the more of a habit it become the more it's reinforced essentially um so the more we can prevent it from happening there that are\nAlso making sure your cat has enough distance making sure they're staying under their threshold using toys to redirect 'em pheromones are also really popular those are kind of hit and miss and another thing is\nI don't want my clients ever be afraid to talk to their ... about medications I hear so many times oh I don't want I don't want to have to put my cat on medication\nIt's not a bad thing it's never a bad thing because there are just some just kind of need a little bit of help you know it's like people [laughter] it's just like people and there's there shouldn't be any negative stigma around any of it because it just takes him down to a normal learning level\nAnd sometimes it depends on what it is that we're seeing in the kitty cat as to what type of medication that they might need and they can really help improve their training and re direction if we can get some of these brain chemicals a little bit more stabilized for these cats\nSo that then they can actually learn these new behaviors or redirect these old behaviors into more positive things\nDefinitely yeah it's it just takes them you know from my pen\nDown to six maybe and it just kind of helps them\nTo be able to have those herrings of positive things because once your cat is just kind of way off the wall\nThey're not learning anything you know they are just so focused on what could happen what scary what do I need to do next they need to stop this person and pounds and jump and bite and scrap\nKnow what could happen what scary what do I need to do next they need to stop this person and pounds and jump and bite and scratch they just don't have the opportunity so definitely setting them up for success is key um yeah that's really yeah and if there comes a point\nWhere medication is appropriate for your cat now you're going to be going on in the world am I going to get into the kitty cat\nWell the good news is that okay you got a cat that might be food motivated that's one way you can sometimes get that medication into a pill pocket or other soft treat that they could eat there are ways of flavoring liquid medications and then there's the lovely ...\nAs long as your cat will let you pet its head and its ears that is one of the safer ways to be able to administer certain types of medication not everything can be turned into a trans terminal\nBut it's one of the things we are constantly in contact with the ... Carey wellness and asking them\nCan you turn this medication into a transistor and will because we have a cat who will not ticket or early and I don't want my point to get hurt or the cat to spit it out [laughter] which is obviously counterproductive and so talk with your veterinarian about well is this something that we could do in a transistor mo Jo\nAs long as your cat let you get to the IRS that's one of the easiest ways for us to be able to administer certain types of medication but it has to be appropriate for that cat and the medication has to be able to be absorbed through the skin and so you need to have a good relationship with your veterinarian and your compounding pharmacy to figure out what's going to work for your kitty cat\nAnd I tell you they work with us we will call them and say okay this isn't working what other options do we have to try and they will help us out in that respect\nAnd another thing too is talk to your veterinarian if you have a behavioral issue a lot of these cats that just randomly become aggressive\nThere might be an underlying medical issue you know it might be paying it might be a bad teeth there's so many different causes hormones and exactly there's so many different reasons and a lot of the underlying ones can be medical\nUm so I always tell my clients make sure you're getting your cat in for regular checkups even if you think they're perfectly healthy just get 'em in\nYeah cats are so good at hiding when they're actually sick and we are we've discussed this many times is that they will hide the fact that something's not right with them until such time as it hits that threshold that it's obvious that they can hide it anymore and that's usually what we end up seeing is okay they've now been sick sick sick and they drop over this this little cliff\nAnd now we have an obviously sick cat that has been hiding the fact that there's something that we might have been able to do sooner\nMhm and another thing I'm a lot of people are scared of cats with kids ... um cats you know sometimes don't get along with kids because kids can sometimes he really scary they make loud noises they have\nWeird toys that they throw at the at the end you know the the cat sometimes are also forced to be loved by kids we have to remember\nKathy personal space to yeah they need a vertical cease to be able to get away from everything but still have that vantage point to be able to watch what's going on they need a separate area that if they want to take a break they can some cats don't like to be handled just like some people don't like to be\nYou know just kind of remembering each had as an individual and take that into account if you have a kid making sure that they understand the rules even with dogs you you know it's so important\nHaving kind of that boundary as discussion with everybody in the family and so that\nThe dog or the cat has their space or not for as much as you know everyone's like oh I just love my animals so much and it might be a burden to them you know\nNot for as much as you know everyone's like oh I just love my animals so much\nAnd it might be a burden to them you know sometimes they may not find it as fun as you do we do need to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to talk about the cat to chew on things that they shouldn't carry has personal experience with this and so we want to definitely take an opportunity to talk about that hanging there will be right back after this short message\nNothing as important as family edit idol rode animal hospitals your pets are treated like part of the family there will be seven days a week with twenty four hour nursing care that your pet will never be alone in their state of the facility they're integrated

and get some going that's going to help keep them happy and ultimately that's what we want to do is keep our cats engaged to keep their brains going and the right direction and tried to prevent some of these negative behaviors that you're having to come out and work with people on\nWell carry we want to thank you again for spending your Saturday morning with us coming down from the Phoenix metro

[noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nVolatility is back in a big way as markets continue to get tossed around as more economic data keep\nPouring in and financial reports from various major companies are digested by analysts while key economic indicators are still showing signs of life in the economy along with a roaring job market and low unemployment\nThe fact remains that interest rates are starting to creep up in a big way and are feared by some to put the brakes on this red hot economy\nHome sales in fact are slipping in some areas with prices falling as mortgage rates have increased giving pause to would be home buyers\nAnd then some companies are reporting that terrorists costs are starting to hurt their bottom line\nMeanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to dig it heals into the ground on race saying quote we no longer need to be stimulating the economy unquote it is their job after all to keep inflation at bay\nThis has some on Wall street a little bit concerned as the long term effect of higher interest rates and the potential economic slowdown are still unknown\nAnd when there's a little uncertainty out there Wall Street starts to move in a big way now what does that mean for your money and your retirement\nWell definitely it means more uncertainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent\nSo we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nRetirement planning requires a careful thought process that involved many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some of the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that's due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again\nNow you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows\nBut the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result so what do we think the right thing to do is well it's definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market\nSo our retirement planning process that Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street we've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place to keep our money growing there are much safer alternatives out there\nAnd even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could\nBe an IRA or raw firing a roll over IRA and inherited IRA or a four\nOh one K. or even just regular saving money and in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nSo that's why here at Mayfield financial and the state protection services we feel that what we do is so important we help our clients right here in southern Arizona takes some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio\nWe do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customized plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall street risk\nSo if this sounds interesting to you and you'd like to

worry free financial solutions I'm Nathan Federico a safe money retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives the first is\nThe wealth building an earnings phase this is a time when we are working trying to save\nAnd it's a time when we contribute to things like for one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet and should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building to wealth spending the second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain\nAnd when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets into income\nAnd in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you were a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan and it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one pensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now\nMost of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement\nEspecially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives this is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four O. one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one k.'s and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamity of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they had the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees this is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services this is what\nThe security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going

that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plans do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four O. one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive\nAll with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no commissions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do you need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now
