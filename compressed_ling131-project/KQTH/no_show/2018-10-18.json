us\nRepresentative can impact a local businesses among her constituency\nI mean that that's my background is you know running our Hispanic Chamber and\nSo much of what Congress impacts are done are small business tax reform the tax policy act that recently was passed\nA has been a great cause for businesses and both large and small it's been an opportunity to put more dollars in the pocket of our employees that they were able to buy the show's quip meant I mean you see the economy now just on such an uh an upright it's wonderful we want to continue that\nI'm from that want to continue that effort to really have progress mhm and that's why it's important to keep I think our house majority and to keep this seat in the hands of someone who is pro business Republicans\n... well it seems like Tucson is doing a pretty good job of getting in the or a good way of some of these big companies out there they've noticed is\nYeah I mean I think business attraction is something that he sounds really done well lately UC caterpillar has come in and so many different Amazon logistics center going in Ghana cobra road there's some great momentum going I Want to continue that great\nWell there's some concern out there among Arizona's a notably about health care and there's also some rattling going on in Washington about Medicare and Social Security and ah you know some of the other kinds of issues that are some of the resources and programs that are Americans use pay into uh what about defending\nYeah and uh you know some of the other kinds of issues that are some of the resources programs that are Americans use pay into uh what about defending those kinds of resources for people in southern Arizona\nAbsolutely I think making sure that those that have paid into Social Security does does it promises they've been made and it it's vitally important that they're kept\nOn my own parents aren't Social Security and Medicare ... but you're right that's a lot of the conversation that we're having we're also talking more broadly about the Affordable CARE Act in how that really hasn't worked in Arizona we need to improve and better\nThat process especially for individuals and small businesses as a chamber president I can tell you and most of our members did not ... can't afford to provide any kind of insurance um so we need to improve that uh for the CARE Act\nMhm how's your just\n[laughter] it's coming along I nonstop knocking on doors raising money to keep the TV commercials going and being outraged by my opponent but as many people know she moved here from flags after Tucson to try to take the seat\nAnd interesting dollars from New York and California and Nancy Pelosi and others and it's challenging I'm the local candidate I've grown up here more than forty years a served on many boards and running our our chamber of commerce the Hispanic Chamber for the last nine years\nSo it's kind of definitely local versus outsiders I Would say um but working hard at at least got Nineteen days to go and and I went up when they see it is going to be much like Martha's first race where she won by just a couple of hundred votes\nUm you know it the the most important piece is really that everyone has to get out there and vote with so important to really keep the momentum that great momentum we're seeing in Arizona and in southern Arizona\nNo I haven't seen anybody on the on on any ballot anywhere that we've been talking to so far this season hasn't really pointed the importance of getting out they had voted is absolutely critical and I think a president's made that a\nRather clear a in terms of national support do what about the Republican National committee or what's their disposition towards your race or did they think it's going to be as big a squeaker in early treatment like that\n[laughter] they are it is is considered one of the top five most competitive races in the country right here in the city to in southern Arizona though the Republican National committee has been\nVery supportive we just had the chairwoman come out for me in and talked to folks about how important is to vote and hosts a fundraiser which is wonderful\nA independent groups have come in and come out of the race which is tough um but still hoping to look for support from their mothers that might want engage in the race and helped me get across the finish line but the Republican National and he's been very supportive\nAll right we're Marquez Peterson she's running to replace Martha McSally in Arizona's second congressional district and she joined us on two sons

couple of jobs we've been begging borrowing to keep US Economy going and the borrowing part is something that has no most of our back pockets so how much do you know about credit ABC's Dario ... says today's a good day to learn a little more\nWell it seems to be that way where we are there are certain parts of the country where we're going to see many dog kind of predominate that have that look to them whether or not genetically they actually have a staffordshire terrier in them remains to be seen but this very blocking look\nWith a very large head very muscular body sometimes it can be rather short and stout\nUh it seems to be a common theme especially in southern Arizona that he had the other southern states\nAre where these dogs used to be bred for inappropriate purposes and now they're being bred more for pet purposes or accidental proceedings and so now we have quite a few of them out here [noise] um so they're almost kind of the unofficial\nData point [laughter] that's an interesting uh we we we uh look at the other dogs seem to be kind of stock and bulky like that some of those a Labrador is can be big bloc heads\nThey really can and it depends again on what genetic line there from uh if they're more of a field hunting dogs they're not going to be these tall skinny lanky dog out there to be able to chase\nYeah All right and what's a wolf dog I you know like obviously is a some sort of hybrid they're they seem to be rather common and uh they've gotten the attention of some animal control in a humane a organizations\nSo they are a hybrid and it's a question of how much of the actual offers them bread into a domestic dog and it's usually something like a malamute or husky that they've been cross bread with\nSo they look very wild uh and they are unpredictable if you could imagine they do have some\nVery wild genetics in them uh and we have to be careful with dogs like that in some places they're illegal or other places you have to have special license in order to be able to own and train them and certain precautions have to be in place to make sure that they remain safe and that those who are working with them also remains safe\nDo they want to go back to the wild or they would they have that the literal call Wilder there are\nSome of them can that depends on how much of the wolf is in that hybrid and other ones you know they as long as they're properly cared for do make good companions\nBut it always always questionable as to what's going to happen in a situation with a wolf hybrid so it has to be somebody who is very well trained and understand\nThe hybrid that's going to care for them\nAnd find those talking a little about purebreds um the overtime and we've gotten the reputation of being sickly vulnerable to all kinds of disease I'm maybe some orthopedic problems what's the status of pure bred dogs right now in or out of vets feel about him\nWell purebreds are unfortunately prone to genetically related diseases um some of them are very breed specific so we're talking orthopedics we will be talking more about our large breed dogs and giant breed dogs\nThey are more prone to having hip knee elbow issues and then we have some other dogs that are a little bit\nMore kind of exotic and their parents would talk and things like the English bulldogs they have a lot of orthopedic issues as well and a tremendous number of skin and I issues while and it's something because we breed these now for companions um and sometimes we envied them\nYeah she is while and it's something because we breathed these now for companions\nAnd sometimes we integrate them where we're breeding them to family members that we ended up selecting for the negative things right while looking for something that the parents based now and so unfortunately yes you have a lot of our pure bred dogs that have more genetically based problems than a\nMixed breed dog I though the whole idea of hybrid vigor is actually
