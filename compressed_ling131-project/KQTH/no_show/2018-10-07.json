prison McCain I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr ... he is a nationally recognized authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr biggest thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we called mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a one person is under stress the body transpose is the stress\nInto tension and your muscles end up contracting and everyone feels that and they're in the upper ... right and the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting\nIn in a heart disease digestive difficulties and I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nHealth and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I still roses and fibromyalgia in cramped in their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture and it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their how many ...\nIt has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body with calcium being something\nHow many in Athens issue it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yes okay yeah and it does does your ... but you see one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow and so one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if neither\nThat's right I think and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of above\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the Knight Tricia\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian foods are irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and a calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug maker right but these Cal things don't absorb and the body\nThat's happening for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in like a ... first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment\nBut to see what happens when you take a Tom doesn't antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is not being absorbed\nBy sea because it has to be in a in an as an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comics formula it's natural\nAnd the differences is that\nA powdered and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that solve that problem as well\nYeah because when calcium and easy Myrna liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact I'm reading the can right now says offense to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills the calcium and especially the magnesium being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium in their body\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have written noticeable thing the right to their little trips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect where a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time\nYou know to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] Dr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles and they need them actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this ... formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back in ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period and it it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this ... formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a candidate to lady who was suffering\nAbout arthritis what about joint pain well\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body it'd be in or near could be Internet could be in her elbow and I'm ... and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming\nAnd I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough but she was the one who took a week of the formula account max formula and um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made\nIt out to her friends that's amazing\nAnd when I use this with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles work in rural relax shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication so\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium may need them in the system well so the very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body and experiencing because it's deficient in many of them it's also blocking for their absorption\nSome so it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah you have nothing to lose\nBy folks again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula\nThere is a special toll free

about the international real estate market and what it means to you\nWe're going to continue our end up conversation now with the international real estate expert last hour she talked with us about bringing foreign buyers to your open house and know how you can buy your dream home faraway lands\nJoining us now is Patricia ... real toward an international sales director with the\nYour global agents team at Caldwell banker residential real estate in Sarasota, Florida\nPatricia thanks for being back with us on realistic today absolutely so now let's change the conversation to Americans who want to buy either across the street or over the border where are we looking for\nA lot of Americans are buying in\nRetirement ... now outside of our own country\nBut we think people are going to Costa Rica to Panama uh Mexico those are three big over the last\nUm we see them going to tax hey that was like the Bahamas and some of the Caribbean or the spring but we have all the areas that we refer them to ... to ...\nSo what that process like Patricia what's the first step\nIt really is on the situation generally if I'm wrong I think it's fine you know they\nDidn't know the area I'm not always but I Would say look people you know and it worked in an area that friends that have been on holidays they catch them\nSo they know where they are looking\nAround I spoke to them about what what exactly are looking for this and then my story is ... how long were you you're going to be living that during the year you want to rent it when you're not using it so you know a lot of people by federal vacation homes and want to work for them while they're not using them\nAnd that helps me understand what they're trying to a chain but typically I get a picture that is for national cured partner in the right location and the funny part is it could be more than one location I had a British down on recently who wants to buy something in Contra lurk up buddy\nKnow you want it to look at how long you want it to the coasts\nYou spent on recently who wants to buy something in Central America but he just you know like you want it to look at how long you want to smoke a Costa Rica but we spend tend to partners in both countries and he thought this particular jumping I decided on on them all\nBut he felt confident with the introductions we give him so apartments in most countries did not really have to prove themselves as much as they would have done if you just called up from the Internet I\nDo most Americans who buy in foreign countries do they also go all cash by say either taking equity out of their properties here or cashing out stock or something along those lines\nYes they do because it's very hard for Americans to qualify for mortgage in other countries but usually they passed by a sudden you write and that'd be leveraging home equity line here or selling some we'll hear all that stuff portfolio to buy it but they would typically be cash buyers and the country\nBecause of the exchange rates and how they fluctuate if I put a contract to own a house or one million dollars in another country is it possible by the time I get to closing is going to be one million two hundred thousand\nIt could be one million two hundred thousand that could be eight hundred dollar [laughter]\nMy my advice or with anyone who's involved\nWhen you when you buy in a foreign country or in a foreign by yeah there are we to ... as they're trying to actually own now you know the sailing thought just sort of property but there's also the currency tons auction and not really because the very carefully\nSo you need to understand what's happening in your father's currency and planning ahead\nAnd now special companies right now that you can work with to help you with that funding situation so they'll find your too\nThey love someone who will educated you were about things that influenced the currency exchange rate not the key indicators that are going to be published that might have an impact on the exchange and they'll help you learn\nHow and when to change your money to that currency\nNo I understand there are companies that will lock in your exchange rate so if the changes you won't get stuck at the settlement table is that real\nNo absolutely it's real and they allow you to locate in the ... the ... for a period of time and all I Do is I I tend to spend a big trade in my own and not look thin actually it looks in the exchange rate for up to yeah so it's something for customers to think about\nNot just one that buying or selling\nBut also when they're looking at cost of ownership you know when they're paying that insurance premiums back home though fees that property taxes if they can go into a year or whether they know that oh it's going to achieve a particular currency right back very reassuring for that\nI see in the last question for Patricia yes one of our listeners wants to buy a house overseas with all your experience what's a number one piece of advice they must know before they go forward with it\nThey most use a local county love love love about the time they should not be in any way associated with\nAll introduced by the builder the developer real estate at Jones\nAll the ... of that property that need to find an independent attorney to work with\nGreat advice Patricia and thank you so much\nWell thank you anytime I can help just let me know which was shut down\nGreat great advice Patricia and thank you so much\nWell thank you for letting me know\nPatricia tan real chore and international

special segment on real estate today in which we talk to a real estate professionals economist journalist or industry expert\nAnd asked them about things you need to know about and right now we've all heard the economy of the United states is chugging along strongly I mean after all the GDP is up\nEmployment is up and we all know the stock market is way up\nAnd that's apparently causing the Federal Reserve to look closely at whether they should continue to raise interest rates if they do and you're in the market to buy a house how can that affect you looked ask a professional\nJoining us now is Lawrence you the cheaper ... of the national association of real tours Lawrence welcome to real estate today\nHello Steven and as you alluded to a communist went quite terrific guy in terms of GDP Growth uh in terms of job gains wages only rising stock market is still way up there are so there are brought signed up the very positive economic picture a yet home sales\nBecause of a deal limiting inventory\nIs being held back a compared to what it could be\nAnd of course Lawrence for all those positive reasons that the economy is so good the fed is raising interest rates [noise] do you think that's going to have any impact on buyers in the market in the months ahead\nWhen the Federal Reserve raises interest rate first we have to understand they are raising short term\nInterest rates and long term most consumers have thirty year fixed rate mortgage so or the mortgage rate may not move\nDirect relation with what the Federal Reserve maybe you're doing a less or some of the homeowners have the adjustable rate mortgages Danny could change but fortunately over Ninety percent of recent homebuyers\nAre taking on those long term thirty year fixed rate mortgage so they would not feel the pain of any rising interest rates but to consumers consumers who are looking to buy a maybe a mortgage rate will inch higher and the overall forecast says\nOr any are so they're getting the most from

you're back goes out more than you do or your contact list only has people with names that end an MD\nFor some of us unfortunately it seems we sure do get to know a whole lot of doctors\nIn the medical world there are general practitioners and then there are specialists each medical professional plays a key role in our help\nWe have cardiologists near all adjust psychologist dermatologist and the list goes on so if you are dealing with heart troubles you don't go to the dermatologist to take care of that you go to the cardiologist\nLike the medical world it is somewhat similar in the financial world there are many different types of financial professions and depending on your situation each can play a key role in your financial help\nWe have CPAs estate planning attorneys stock market investment advisors insurance agents brokers hedge fund managers and again the list goes on and on each of these advisors can play an important role in determining your financial help\nSo today I'm not here to tell you that you need to leave your current advisor or perhaps you don't have one that's OK today I Want to talk to you about how having a financial specialist one that specializes in building retirement income is so important to your financial help\nEspecially as you are near or already in retirement\nAt Mayfield financial NSA protection services for over twenty five years we have specialized in creating safe income strategies for our clients we oversee more than one hundred million dollars in safe money client funds right here in ...\nThousand clients that enjoy our retirement income planning strategies\nSo what do we do and why to our clients love us it's pretty simple we are safe money advisors and for that certain part of your portfolio we do not recommend or use any strategies or investments that have a potential to lose money from stock market risk\nWe have never had to have a conversation with any of our clients about why they lost money due to stock market performance\nNo of course we're more than just one trick pony is over here and Mayfield financial over the years we have assembled an entire team a financial specialists that can take care of everything you need in the financial world in retirement\nBut here at Mayfield financial we believe and know that getting this first part of your retirement plan the safe money income part is so crucial so we focus entirely on that\nAs safe money specialists in the financial world we can help you turn that part of your retirement portfolio into what it needs to be in retirement and that is\nIncome income that last one that grows and is protected and now it doesn't have to be income that starts right now\nSome of the best planning takes place about five years before you need to start to use your nest egg in retirement before you start to need to get that income\nSome call it the retirement danger zone and that's about five years before and after you retire\nThat's the time where it's most important to look for and speak with their retirement income specialists one that can create a guaranteed income stream and protect your retirement from stock market losses\nIt's about building a foundation of income from that part of your portfolio to create the income for that you are going to want to have in retirement one that will take care of your essentials to cover your needs to take care of those basic expenses\nWhen you do that you unlock inability to truly have a worry free retirement\nSo to learn more for yourself on a ... a foundation of income and about working with a retirement income specialists and to learn a little bit more about Mayfield financial\nIt's a time that we need to convert assets into income and in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you are a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan\nAnd it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of them and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement especially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives\nThis is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee it income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four O. one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down then during the ...\nThey lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire this couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and then the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey failed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with
