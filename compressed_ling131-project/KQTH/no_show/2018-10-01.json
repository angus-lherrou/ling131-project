is he at that point I bet for the New York times Sunday call me address the one week time limit on the investigation by saying that the fact gathering process is quote not as hard as Republicans hope it will be\nNow that that flies in the face of calling for more time that would that would contribute to the idea that we're take less time and that little lies point to bigger lives\nWell I agree with that you're a big lie or a six foot eight lie and um you leaked to the New York times classified documents\nOr because and then you uh you know and then I knew what he admitted it later on I

now here we are we're stuck with them that's how that goes to kill me added that FBI agents are far better equipped to handle any investigation than politicians are what does that had to do with anything\nCause that politicians have staff people and they have staff investigators many of whom are former law enforcement and uh they're they're investigators are professional federal government investigators with the power of the law behind them and when you speak to them if you lie even if you're not under oath you can go to jail for it asked George Papadopoulos\nNo relation to George

hanging their coup fees on here these terrorists\nI got to tell you they are these people are so amazing I here's my position Kavanaugh sits on the court\nKavanaugh is confirmed based on what we know now unless there's some major revelation between now and then if we find that the FBI reaffirms what federal government investigators have already affirmed\nBy way of talking to the witnesses in the Christine Blasey Ford case you know Christine Blasey Ford whose own family will not come out and say that she is truthful or honest or reliable dependable or won't sit with her own family won't or ...
