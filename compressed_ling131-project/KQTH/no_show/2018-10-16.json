J. R. H.\nA out of uh what is it a tele co-op I'm going to go with ...\nCherokee Nation issued a statement Monday on Massachusetts senator guys wouldn't take a listen both Warren's DNA test result Senator Warren released her DNA report to the news media with a phony help but some funny academic at a phony college\nOr in response to president Donald Trump's taunting her for saying she was part Native American you know I Will I Will have it be known President Trump did not start this this was well underway I was calling her focus on us before\nPresident Trump even came down the escalator running for president so and and that's not to like say I invented it because I just want to point out that the news media is saying that President Trump invented this this taunted this mockery of a\nOf a Senator Warren with her phony Indian thing and that's not true this has been going on for a long time this mockery of of her\nOf her ridiculous claim\nSenator Warren blister and says the report and it said that the great majority of Warren's identifiable ancestry is European however the report adds the analysis also identified five genetic segments as Native American in origin\nAt high confidence this is what Elizabeth Warren put out now this is a a joke of course\nHowever yesterday afternoon Cherokee Nation released a statement saying\nHe hadn't part that DNA tests are useless in determining tribal citizenship and people using DNA to connect themselves to Cherokee Nation is inappropriate\nAnd uh that was a a gentle right on what they said because they were a little more direct the statement itself says from the Cherokee Nation\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish\nListen to this whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and wild DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nI senator or you're gonna you racist you began are you going to stop offending Native Americans now it makes a mockery out of DNA tests\nAnd it's legitimate uses while also this honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage that is from the Cherokee Nation secretary of state\nWho is named Chuck ... junior ... junior who is the secretary of state of the Cherokee Nation they're independent nations was also on the television last night on Fox News channel it was on CNN surprise surprise where he didn't help or Elizabeth Warren's cause\nProves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best can give you some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're related to somebody live long ago that may have lived in North and South America maybe in a native peoples of those continents um it's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country\nIt is irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American so this whole thing was just won't want wrong it's Emily la tele it's never\nMind my DNA test doesn't say anything in fact if it indicates anything it indicates that I Am less Native American than the average Whitey on the moon okay [laughter]\nI got to get to Whitey on the moon a little later on why is Whitey on the moon\nIn the show today well you might be surprised but it's another reason I'll get to it in a little bit another reason they're a crazy people now let's go to Elizabeth Warren she's out there saying that the president or a million dollars let's go to number four\nBecause this is what President Trump actually said when he made this ah the news media and and and Elizabeth Warren not smart people not the really you can't take them seriously\nSaying no President Trump or a million dollars because she fulfilled all of the requirements that President Trump laid out if she gets a DNA test\nAnd it proves that she is in fact part Paul Paul then President Trump owes her a million dollars this is the phony arguing that they just lie about everything they live right by Brett Kavanaugh that a lot about Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton lives about everybody they live about everything\nAnd a President Trump actually said these words in July about the DNA tests\nYou know those little kids they saw on television for two dollars\nAnd first of all those little kids and in\n[noise] what she claims that she's of Indian heritage\nBecause her mother said she has hiking boats\nSet her mother such yet I think about when he was\nVery gently take that cat and we want to say\nHey for like ... if you take the test that shows you're in\n\n[noise] no the test does not show she's an Indian me a debate has not happened\nShe is not the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United states has not given her the uh the uh DNA tests on a stage during the presidential debate a and a and and I didn't\nHear him call her mother a liar which is another light and that what she said that she keeps calling my mother a liar President Trump keeps going my mother a lawyer that he didn't call a Elizabeth Warren's mother mall pall a liar didn't call anybody a liar\nHe didn't want to call my mom a liar\nHe didn't do that and he showed she just lied there in calling a\nSaying that President Trump was lying about her mother being a liar there's a lot of lying going on here is full circle festive lives a tangled train wreck of laws and stupidity\nBut there it is um he didn't say that your mother is alarm or he did say that you have to become the nominee beyond a debate stage she gives you the DNA kid you don't get to pick your own DNA person who's a you know a corrupt a Democrat fellow traveler from a college campus\nBut it did when a CNN listen to that or watch that video this morning Alison Schmidt Allison ... who used to\nListen to it and said huh maybe everything that I've been saying all my wife is a giant lie and President Trump is in fact the most truthful president in modern history\nOkay and then he didn't mean it was during the ... on the other he said he just he just that I said he had been [noise]\nHe just won me over maybe it didn't really mean it was during the debate and then he ... okay well I actually listen to what I said now and one me over not winning you over it's just you you should listen to what you should pretend to be a reporter for five seconds a day and see what happens instead of a Democratic Party hack\nOn a cable TV station advancing the cause of the Bolshevik Revolution which you pretty much do every day amazing John Berman he's talking about your pencil next and a ... a this morning it's the it's the show she just a fighter she's a fighter\nShe wants to fight the fight at the point is ridiculous back and forth over the million dollar wanting to because she wants relevant now\nShe wants it because she wants relevance no no she just wants to fight in fact she's a let's go live now to the White House we're a little bit of Warren has gathered her force [noise]\nHorseback\nHouse by storms and they have taken\nOn a lecture guys because they lie all the time and I make stuff\nI watch my mother to be a liar isn't it they didn't say your mother is a liar that's completely ridiculous people and then the news media they're they're out there they're carrying Elizabeth Warren's water for her uh to the president tonight went right through the prison United States and said I'm don't\nYou old lizard warrant an apology because you said her mother's a lawyer and that she's not on Indian and now we see that she is Indian at least one one thousand twenty fourth a Peruvian so therefore she's right and you're wrong and you should apologize\nThe uh the guy on CBS didn't say well now that we're in the age of believing women instead of calling them bimbo job destroying them don't you think your husband should face the music for raping Juanita Broderick he didn't ask that interestingly enough\nAbout for wagons renting a phase Paula Jones and saying just said about that as like maybe you should face the music for that no because they were adults and my husband was cheating on me again\nWhy [noise] jail

that Brett Kavanaugh shows his when he was appointed to the court notwithstanding the Democrats' best smears\nWhen Brett Kavanaugh became an associate justice of the United States Supreme court he chose his clerks when he chose his clerks he'd shows all women to be his clerks that is the first time in the history of the Supreme Court that a justice had all women as clerks\n\nGot very little
