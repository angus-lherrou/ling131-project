I digress sorry Jerry I digressed they're just a little but I just wanted to know his thought on that so long haul trucks do you do you do much with long haul trucks\nOver there you know I had no idea what you were talking about when you were describing it I was thinking of a train\nIt and I'm telling you it is to me\nI don't quite understand how it just feel as safe as much feel as they say it well I don't quite get that yet I'm Still trying to figure it out 'cause you know that's not my area where I tell if it's not my area\nLike Michael in the movie Michael it's not my area [noise] but um I I just think the technologies and the things we're thinking of in the last mile delivery uh things were going into\nIt seems to me like all cities are going to be smart city's pretty soon you know there we've got these people movers now that are coming out and I know two sons been looking at some of them and what they are as an airport you see those um [noise]\nThe walkway is ending the moving walkway things those are people movers and what they're doing is is they're calling them moving sidewalks\nAnd in big cities rather than go to get your car to go to lunch down the road or whatever they're putting these moving sidewalks and so that people can just get there quicker and get their lunch and get back to work quicker but\nI think that cities are really starting to take on the challenge of less traffic and the city\n[noise] moving people a little bit quicker in the city so maybe we won't need as much in the automotive mechanics field what ... what do you think I mean\nGive they give a car to the colleges you applied for it and they tell him you have six months to build a flex fuel vehicle or six months to build the most fuel efficient vehicle your cats wouldn't it be fun if we had a couple of businesses who would spots or something like that for high school\nOr they do have something similar to that I don't know when it goes down here in Tucson yes yes it's um the high school kids get into a competition I've seen it go down at the asphalt track at Tucson Speedway\nThey basically called the ... crew challenge oh I'm I'm I haven't been to one yet I heard it's pretty interesting pretty comical very competitive\nI Know who you know who who heads the whole thing up you have a clue I'm again I'm Bob\n...

don't know I'm going to check that's what I Want to see oh that would be I\nThink that would be so full they see these kids do it I I just think there's so much opportunity\nNo I'm going to check that out is what I Want to see oh that would be cool I think that would be so cool to see these kids do it I\nI just think there's so much opportunity there for these guys are now there's just a lot of other sort of you and we can we can can you imagine close our eyes to him we need him I tell everybody one of these days I Want to be sitting on a beach somewhere and not having to worry about this I Want somebody to take over for me and I you know I shutter sometimes to think that that's not going\nTo happen because you just don't see that\nThe commitment from some of our\nSome of our mid twenty to thirty year olds like do these high school kids so I'm hoping I'm hoping\nFor the best [noise] All right so you know what nobody I guess everybody out there in cyber world thinks that they just can't stump weight come on your guy somebody can stump Wade was a question and I'm gonna I'm starting to think that I have to offer something for someone to do this but I have a\nI have a T shirt and I I have a hat and cousy for morale vertical Rausch clean tech jak Russia's company that I Will give to the first person who can call in and dumb way with a question\nAbout their car sorry can't be any anything about their wife and then it can be a technical question no one can only buy pathetically oh sure\nAll right so I've got a hat and ...\nAnd I might even throw up ten in their ah or or a a key chain from Roche racing from jak Rausch and I will give it to the first person who calls in and stumps weighed with a question on their car\nSo the number again is five to seven five one ten forty one first person to call in and dump way that's the new game I kinda liked that game stumped weighed\nSong is called me stumped be weighed me when I was on jury I think we're on to something here so we're not Mr tests don't goes then you've got stumped me wait on them I really doubt likely many stumped the way consumers sick\nOh no way now now we've got which can be a big\nDeal Jerry you watch dumpy wait everybody's fine nice but it is good you got to admit it as good All right so you tell me what what types of all feel questions you have any outfield questions you wonder if\nYou want to know that\nI'm missing [noise]\nWhy do we have different grades of automotive fuel to me I always think if we invest our money and to making one good product giving one price across the world just like taxes\nSo do you want to [laughter] do you want to know the true reason or do you well what I think yeah and yeah yeah yeah true then why\nDid give me the politician reason I Want to give you the politician reason so I have always heard that if your car says that it can only take the highest octane Ninety One and you got what eighty nine in or eighty seven eighty nine and Ninety One one All right\nThat that's BS that\nYou can put any greater fuel in that car and I think what it was just another way to make money I'm Sorry I go shooting shooting occur but that's what I think I think that it was just in one more way to get another penny a gallon which people go penny a gallon no big deal I tell a lot of money\nYeah uh and to rebuff\nThat I guess I'm higher octane vehicles the reason why they're requiring higher octane is because these generally these engines have a higher ...\nUm higher octane vehicles the reason why they're requiring higher octane is because these generally these engines have a higher compression in other words\nIt takes a lot more in our show a lot more force because you're creating so much power\nThat you're going to need that hotter burning higher octane fuel to make that engine thumb and I we don't have that that causes a pre detonation in cylinders which in automotive feel we called pinning\nYou're going along you're starting to get on the freeway you're given anything really good and throughout all in all of a sudden you're injured goes bar or something like that uh we call a pre detonation a lot of times it just has to do with poor fuel ... a poor fuel um so\nI was told though that that was the case long ago before we were putting such so much oxygen in the field but now that we have higher oxygen can now every gallon of gasoline you pumped into your car has up to ten percent ethanol all year round\nThat's that's where you're getting at high octane okay I ...\nA drier fuel yes his ... havoc on our older vehicles oh yeah because it's drying ... out on my for auto body on my Nineteen Ninety GMC\nThat I completely agree so but I was told that that takes care of the whole higher well\nHi same vehicle it's a high performance engine if Iran eighty seven or eighty nine I get ... nation painting and there are some around that's good for me to know 'cause I was to me I I Would invest and just making Ninety One octane because that will work and all I just say forget it to the rest because you think so I\nMean that's not that's kind of like\nWhat I think when you sell you eighty five or eight fifty five or whatever you're going to sell because I think that it has to be completely separate you know ... ...\n... ... ... your oh let's go Karen\n...\nAre stuck up late morning how are you I'm good how are you I Am great idea of a stump weighed question\nWell could be I don't necessarily\nUm I'm not necessarily calling to get the shirt and the hat I'm calling just to get\nPerhaps an answer OK okay I Am as a two thousand and Honda Civic and when I filled up with gas it washes back and forth in other words when I'm packing the car in the garage and I stopped\nAnd searched ... you can hear you can hear it slashing can hear the liquid sloshing [noise]\nAnd I've had it forever\nOkay but no um other than that but you're on the symptoms that you could do smell feel OK well my first guess\nEducated guess would that be there's possibly a baffle inside the fuel tank that has been compromised oh causing the access to feel sloshing in there\nOh I'm you know that's that's a tough one that's um that's my first encounter my first impression that with it is it possibly an easy fix\n'em if it's going to probably be a fuel tank replacement if the ... side is gone south\nOh so that could be a yeah it's kind of kind of a tricky one or live with it [noise] well\nWould say into starts giving you other symptoms um if he's definitely if you start to smell fuel though I get it addressed you might have the ...\nSymptoms um if you ... if you start to smell fuel though I get it addressed you might have a\nWeek or a leak on the top of the tank that's not exposed itself per se I'm getting there and they're it's causing a little bit of sloshing is I'm not a very ... not a very common problem there way to diagnose that\nI mean how do you notice ways to do it I Would say you're probably going to have to run the fuel tank fairly low ... out of fuel and um that's gonna be the easier for us to diagnose because if we have to drop that tank we don't need it feel full of fuel\nOh All right I'm sometimes a when that baffle breaks that basically inside your tank they tried to build a box inside that tank that hold your last five gallons of fuel swim that check swim that fuel like comes on you're going to have three to five gallons of fuel sitting in that little box\nNot up boxes basically baffles if the baffled breaks\nThat five gallon three gallon of reserve is no longer there and it's going to slash out into the side of your tank when you go around the corner the vehicle may start to die and then when you go straight at my start to pick itself up until\nUm sometimes you can put engine oil guy in it and stuff we used to find the engine oil leaks ah some manufacturers do not recommend this they claim that it will do a harm to your vehicle [noise]\nUm I have never done the research so if a vehicle if the manufacturers says do not add a wild I I Do not add oil by\nUm but that's one way to kind of see your engine oil little a little easier as as they saw engine oil die should be able to check on your manual that says anything about engine oil die and called a vehicle manufacture our call your favorite automotive shop but then do the research for you get back with you\nOh okay well the only few that I found in my owner's manual I've got a ... a Ninety seven uh Tacoma [noise] and um [noise] watch a little different ones is when you check the oil in the white but uh when you're done with the process before you stick to\nThe stick back in the to just\nWipe it off the other one the other but it doesn't say anything about doing that but I guess that's because of the little bit related to what we're talking about the oil clean yeah oh to\nAlways always wiping them with went freak loss when you pull him out initially by them clean put undocumented pull it back out wiped clean again check it on your third try [noise]\nOkay I I also had the other question for calling the weight [noise] yeah these are back to my owner's manual on both of these two are said vehicles are they a mentioned emphatically not to use more than ten percent ethanol mhm\nAnd yet I Can't find a place around the Tucson area on over here and Miranda that ah that the cells and it's all appears to be a minimum a Fifteen Percent\nOr now right now in the state of Arizona you're you're getting anywhere between eight and usually it's right around ten percent a little over ... yeah yeah because that's what we use as an oxygen and accept the ten percent for oxygen level\nSo you just don't have a flex fuel vehicle and so you're you're fine with what we have here [noise] um he is a year round that year round here oh okay oh it's like you're just like our diesel fuel here has five percent by a diesel any year round\nI see so well it's good to hear you I think I heard you listen to a lot of radio shows but seems like you've been ... I've heard at least once before it has been a long time ago\nOh I'm I I Try to help out Jerry on every neat [noise] okay well thank you very much\nThank you thank you Dan and I'm so excited you know why I'm excited when you're hoping somebody Hi guys dumb 'cause I've got Brenda and look at what her her her yeah it says this is a stem weighed question right Brenda let's do it\n[laughter] okay well I have two things one is a question and the one the other ones to try to stump wait\nOkay which one do you want for that to the question first okay\nAs far as gasoline goes is there I hear different things you know it's better to buy over here where they sell shell or it's better to go over to our co or it's better to go to ... is there any particular better place to buy gas is at Costco or doesn't even matter\nAlerts better go over to our co or it's better to go to ... is there any particular better place to buy gas is at Costco or doesn't even matter\nIt ... and ... and they give you my opinion and I'm like wait if way difference with my opinion will let him\nUm I always try to buy fuel at a reputable location but I in my opinion it's pretty much the same because they all by from the same suppliers it's not like they're making their own gas\nOut there somewhere they're all buying from the same suppliers that being said there can be bad gas in multiple places I mean you're you're Exxon Mobil can have bad gas at some point so I mean I don't want to tell you that it's all good are all bad but\nI always go by my price which is probably a bad thing that way what do you what's your idea there\nAre you are correct field comes from the same bucket\nOr different says is the name brands Chevron Texaco whatnot um they basically will test the fuel kind of like you would test your pool water um if it if it doesn't get up to their standards they pour their own\nSecret sauce and the fuel and now it's Chevron with tech ground now shell with uh what shall I forgot yeah you know what you're saying shell has their own flavor of tech Ron if that's what you want to call it\nIn all does circle K put something in probably but they don't they don't advertise it so I wouldn't know that that doesn't affect\nYour engine any kind of way go into all these different places but their own different things and there\nAre not per se um\nI Would say if you're going to buy at a certain grade though you should stick with that grade what do you think\nYeah yeah um you know it's hit or miss some people like to run the inexpensive feel that eighty seven octane eighty nine ... octane and then every third tank they like to run the brain because you know they don't leave it's going to clean their system to me I run Supreme all the time pay a little more you're going out of the cleaner burning engine um the the fuel even if\nEven if the manual says the use unless it's all and it's all unleaded oh it is uh-huh oh\nYeah um they were and says with the higher octane it is going to burn longer in the cylinder wall so's there and burn cleaner so theoretically it's supposed to increase your fuel mileage but the problem is is when you when you get in your car and you feel that it's got more power you tend to give it more\nGas pedal cars you got a faster running car and then your fuel mileage is gone south and you're wondering why am I feel mileage as bad\nAs you said your your Supreme in your car yes okay so that that's the one that's considered high octane\nCorrect okay what Ninety\nOne when you look at the gas pumps it'll say Ninety One\nOkay [laughter] okay well that answered my question um appreciate that like All right I think there's\nI have a question I think that'll stumped you is this what's\nThe difference between a turbo chargers at a super charger\nA turbo chargers require on a require air to get sucked in\n'em and wants his heirs sucked and it increases the speed on the turbine\n'em and these turbo chargers can run a good ten times so if your engines doing a thousand misses hypothetical your engines doing two thousand rpm that terrible charger from what I understand is turning up in the range of twenty thousand rpm um they do that's why when people say we get turbo lag\nTakes a moment for that air to get sucked into the turbo increase the boost uninsured out the exhaust super chargers are pro chargers are I think super charters I don't want to miss\nIncrease the boost and then shot out the exhaust super chargers are pro chargers are I think super charters I don't want to miss misspeak I'm not very uh ... parents were protests proper pro chargers but super chargers um it's basically a corkscrew looking device\nOr that sets in this big old box and it produces its own air there's no there's no hesitation there is no turbo lack basically once you get a gas it's there the powers there\nA turbo chargers as you tend to go as you increase speed it continues to increase the fans speed on the turbo chargers I. E. S. Y. turbo chargers tend to never lose power the faster you go the more power they create a pro charger super charger\nI'm at the powers there instantly uh and stays there throughout the throughout the dry but it doesn't\nPer se increased power as you go faster not like a turbo chargers that's why we're about charges they have boost you know zero to thirty pounds a boost in some of these vehicles to wear on a super charger there is no boost gauge I mean it's pretty much you just gave a gas and you take off like a like a like a really fast vehicle that\nCan take their friend that I'm right on what\nI say I I yeah I I'd say he got it right on their yes\nOh man [laughter] and I didn't how use my smartphone either [laughter] right\nBrenda thank you so much for playing though that that's great we need to stop and help us\nAnd please if if those people out there know more about pro chargers in Sudan ... call in and educate me am I learned\nAll right well thank you very much I really enjoy the show how right ... thank you\nBye bye Bye bye\nOh I just love this new game I I got to figure this out I got to get all kinds of prizes and I got I got to get Jerry into play in some way because she's not the way it needs to be stumped\nI I we got to have at least one more caller come and try to stop and come on you guys one more caller to stomp way all got out All right now we got out now you have a stump weighed question\nUh no it was rather just called in stumped what it is wrong that's what I wanted to hear come up and go ahead let's say let's\nSay a ... charger there's powered by the exhaust exhaust Toomey engine spin the turban who has a chef connected to another turban that compressors the Internet or\nA super charger is belt driven are driven off the end of the chronic\nThat's the difference they both make boost they both could have a Bruce cage [noise] neither one of them generates or they check the air and compress it that's all for smaller engine [noise]\nYou guys called in and made it made it a lot easier I Hope Jerry heard and I I sure hope he was proud of us I think we did pretty good job what do you think I think we did All right and you know and if not hey you should have been\nHere All right guys have a great first year weekend and I'm sure you're hearing next week [noise]\n[noise]\nLess coverage during his own morning new on your return electric destination one oh four one K.

cancer awareness a lot of the dogs that are rescue have been through trial and tribulation and um you know have been resilient through that challenge so we're there to shore support for um for people going through some some struggles with their own\nAnd um and will be there in in support of those efforts so uh we hope to have a lot of foreign hope to have a great turnout um\nAnd yeah that's going on tomorrow downtown\nSo if people were interested in actually joined\nOh we hope to have a lot of foreign hope to have a great turnout um and yeah that's going on to moral downtown\nSo if people were interested in actually joining this walk what would be the best way for them to find out more information about it [noise] so\nYou can go on our Facebook page and we have created I'm an event and you can search or our Facebook by typing in ...\nAnd um it will have the information on their registration starts at seven o'clock in the walk will begin I ate I mean you can still sign up the day of and you'll see us out there waving the signs and I'm\nA matching shirts so advocating for some great causes\nYeah and You're welcome to bring 'em your freedom faster or it is a pet friendly event they are just asking that you sign a waiver prior to participating in the walk\nBut we'll have some of our own dogs out there will have a group of about five breed ambassadors um and we have quite an interesting group we have tried pods we had ... that are going to be participating\nSo it will be a a group of misfits but we wouldn't have it any other way [laughter]\nMark knows all about the tripod thing [laughter] we love misfits ah\nAnd I I Do have to say they are a misunderstood\nOf dogs can't really call them a breed just group of dogs and it is unfortunate that they have the reputation that they have\nA so I Want to turn it over to you guys since obviously you're going to advocate hugely for this particular breed type because of the rescue organization that you are part of so tell us a little bit about the pit bull type dog how they get this designation and then what the misconceptions are out there\nYeah so you mentioned you work with countless you know ... type dogs\nAnd that that was really be the impetus for our for our mission ride 'em we understood that pit bulls were over represented in in shelters but under represented by advocacy groups and that was really what got us going um and and what really spurred us to to take on this challenge and represent these animals so\nUm you know we're out here and and we know that that there are a lot of pit bulls and shelter environments and um we want to get them out of there we want to show the love we want to fund them great forever homes\nAnd I am glad that you had um referred to them as pit bull type dogs on because as you mentioned you know they there isn't a breed they are not a recognized by the AKC as a breed a staffordshire terrier is but I'm the American pit bull terrier as of now when people say pit bull\nIt's really referring to uh either another breed or a mix that just\nLooks like what we categorize as a pit bull\nOthers are here on the Internet you can they're offering the American ... called ripples we have the Americans ... sometimes the ... or the American bulldog are mistaken for pit bulls logo Argentina and the Japanese torso or or consider ... sometimes even\nBoxers that people can claim that they're pit bulls to and this and especially when you have mixed ... you know your typical my ah many times even though we don't know what they are they do get categorized as hit\nBulls yeah we're here in southern Arizona and so we have a preponderance of the body type of dog that comes through our shelters\nAnd because they have that large block II head stout muscular body there are automatically classified as a pit bull type or a pit bull mix or something along those lines when they're going through the shelters and so people tend to kind of back away from that because of the stigma associated with that name\nAnd that's what you guys are out here trying to break down that stigma us because\nIt doesn't mean you hear that word doesn't mean bad dog that they're not one in in the same\nAnd then we actually has has found a great exercise too you know I identify or pick the pit in in this you know in in a in a gallery photos and it's actually very difficult\nSo you can go on to pick the ... dot com and it's actually a lot of fun you it will give you a bunch of tries to figure out which is truly the American pit bull terrier about twenty photos are yes and you know you'll see that\nHow big of a difference um it is maybe what you perceive as what a pit bull is and what it what the true American pit bull terrier looks like and um we encourage you to go on\nIt is what maybe what you perceive us what a pit bull is and what it what the true American pit bull terrier looks like and um we encourage you to go on a and you can post your results on our Facebook page\nOr again you can search for ... the odd to find our page and we'd love to kind of see what your results are\nKind of give you an idea of what you see is not always what you're getting but also you know the misconception ... so yeah and that's the the concern that we have is now we need to start breaking down this misconception of what's going on with this particular type of dog\nThe term pit bull goes way back\nTo when dogs were used inappropriately as fighting dogs and the initially used actually also bite bait basically bowls or bears and it was an illegal practice in other countries and\nThe pit bull fighting rings that we used to see and unfortunately still see in certain areas illegal dog fighting\nA is where the term came from they are put in an arena or a pit in the ground and allowed to to fight sometimes to the death and of course that leads to aggressive tendencies are often not treated appropriately\nThey are trained to bring out their aggressive side um and these dogs unfortunately get this overall reputation that that's the way they all are going to be regardless of how they've been raised 'em or what their backgrounds are\nAnd that's one of the things that we're trying to stop is this illegal dog fighting because it is very unhealthy for everything involved whether it be the dogs the people\nThe secondary things off and go along with dog fighting and it's usually gambling and drugs associated with it and so this is a very dangerous environment\nThat everybody that's associated with this is involved in a and so trying to stop this and get these dogs out of these environments and prevent them from even having the opportunity to go in that direction\nIs what your group and other groups around the country are trying to do and raising awareness for what this breed type is all about\nAnd how fiercely loyal they can actually be um the aggressive tendencies tone always have to represent these dogs and that's what we want to try to basically correct the perception and these dogs cases\nWell you know at the end of the day they they definitely show more terrier ten ... so they can be high energy they're super intelligent and if you aren't properly giving your animal an outlet on whether it be through training or just different activities enrichment\nThat can lead to over stimulation and lead to unwanted behavior so really trying to advocate and give people the tools to um\nHave their dog be the best they can be whether that be through training um we actually are going to be launching R B the change movement\nSo it's providing the community the resources they need to um succeed and when we started Sable we had anticipated that people would be reaching out to us and that we could help provide training\nBut when they got to us they were just so exhausted and they had given up so the idea of the be the change movement is really getting ahead of that and being able to provide that training a and medical\nSupport before they get to the point where they feel that they have no other options so what that is really going to entail is that's going out into the community we're going to be doing a monthly group training classes at different locations across Tucson we have partnered with the humane society as southern Arizona and we're\nThe flea group training classes at different locations across Tucson we have partnered with the humane society of southern Arizona and we're going to be going in and doing CGI see certification so that canine to citizen\nAnd helping to certify some of their pockets which then in turn the owners can return to the facility and complete some of the training or going to be doing a lot of\n'em just group classes regarding different things that you can do whether it be through enrichment or um\nProper training tools says things like that we're going to be spawn I'm working with different trainers across two sons who are really excited about that 'cause I think it will give the Tucson community an opportunity\nTo just make their dog the best they can be\nLike Emily said you know we we would have members of the community reach out to us\nUm and just ready to relinquish their dog ... if they felt like we had exhausted all other options um and these are efforts or were trying to put into place so that they can get the proper enrichment on the proper training in the proper care before they get to that point of like I'm I'm just throwing my hands up I'm ready to give up right so\nWe're trying to implement these things we're trying to get um the animals with you know with this high energy the outlets that they need the enrichment they need so that the owners don't feel like\nThey've exhausted all other options and and that they can have a dog who is um you know complacent and and um and and and good with their surroundings and sociable and things like that so I'm with our upcoming events particularly our our breast cancer awareness walk tomorrow\nOr him do you want to talk on maybe measures people can take to be sure that they're they're safe and responsible while they're out with or animal\nLeaving the biggest thing is just being an advocate for your dog or don't set them up for failure if you know that your animal isn't doesn't do well around other dogs or\nYou know crowds me freak them out take the necessary precautions are because at the end of the day the dogs than to be the one that suffers and we really being an advocate for your animal is just the best advice I think I can give\nYou know you need to stand up for them and make them set them up for success not failure yeah and that's\nSomething that goes for any breed of dog there are reactive dogs shy dogs on improperly socialize dogs all over the gamut of breeds and mix is out there\nAnd so we need to make sure that as you guys have been talking about proper environmental enrichment mental stimulus proper training and dogs understanding that the expectations of their owners\nAll of those things go together to create a dog who is well adjusted and can do exactly what they need to do as a a good family member and so it is important to make sure that you've gone through the steps or find help to get the steps done\nTo help that dog be the best one that they can be as you were talking about because it's something that people kind of forget you get this cute dog\nYou just want to introduce him into your family you kind of forget that maybe there needs to be some training involved maybe there needs to be some socialization that happens\nEspecially if they have an a questionable background we don't know are a lot of these dogs came from before they come into a rescue environment\nTake a look at this special girl we did an awesome partnership with greater good dot org and they really helped to promote her and show her story ah\nI Know that some of you have seen the video and it will bring tears to your eyes to see just how far she's come and she is still available for adoption we're still\nLooking for that perfect home for her [noise]\nUm I think people sometimes get a little taken back by the braces they think it's going to be a lot of work\nAnd really it's as if you're putting on a pair of shoes every day there's going to yeah it's really not much that goes along with it because at this point she is stable as far as her condition goes she is on her pro fan which is an anti inflammatory but other than that I mean\nAs far as pain wise that's under control and as far as the mean needed mediated Polly arthritis she had been on steroids for that and not\nHave now is now in remission so\nShe is ready for her forever home\nThe Bruce was a really changed her life and and they're really easy to put on it's very um lower for lower for process really like putting on shoes are Velcro slip them on her feet in the morning I'm itchy stress off on her way so that's that's really all it takes a really grab my wife was ...\n[laughter] you might have another dog coming along\nOh that's that's really all it takes a really glad my wife is not listening to smoking\n[laughter] you might have another dog coming along [laughter] oh\nShe's got a soft heart though for those kind of dogs\nAre funny when we when we first started dating and I said you know I propose or my breeder chores I Want to adopt one or two ago I don't know I've heard stories [laughter] and then we got tanker into now whenever there's a story on like the news that the period\n[laughter] she's definitely become an advocate for this type ... yes definitely and I think you guys were able to convert her parents too slowly slowly but surely weeded out of the abort her mom or\nThey're not excited 'cause we let the dogs jump on our couch and sleep on the couch and she's not a as big a fan of that so she likes the dogs of all on the floor\n[laughter] level we're on the floor yeah well\nThat probably has nothing to do with three of everyone [laughter] where she wants to dogs so [noise] yeah I think\nThe more that people interact with this particular type of dog the more that they realize that and the reputation that they have is misplaced and as we kind of joke yeah the lick you to death because that's really what they do the vast majority of the time\nAnd any breed of dog can have their members within that breed that can have questionable behavior for one reason or another and so for us to focus on one particular breed or breed type\nUm I think it's unfair to that particular type of dog fight statistics are out there for all the breeds and unfortunately they're not always accurate\nBecause not every bike it's reported and so it's often the ones that are the worst um that end up in the news and\nYou know the size of dog does have a representation in there as to how bad that's going to be\nBut there are plenty of smaller breed dogs that tend to have a propensity to buy as well depending again on who they are and what their background is and what kind of training that they've had what kind of socialization that they've had\nAnd so we have to keep that in mind is that we can't just say oh it's a bad dog because it looks like this um so\nWhere are the governments are under Twenty years that I've been to attract a hundred and three times on the job to those were ...\nMore Shepard [laughter] [noise] yeah and based\nOn that I'm a little leery of of ... myself [laughter]\nAnd it all goes down to personal experience as well and so it depends on how you were raised with dogs if you have experience with dogs are you going to be a little bit more shy around them\nOr can you watch their body language that is one thing that we talk about on a regular basis especially when we're out and doing public events is understanding canine and feline if necessary body behavior because they're going to tell you a lot about what they're thinking\nBy the way that their body their ears that are facing their Taylor position\nAnd they're going to give you a lot of clues to say yes I'm approachable or no you know what I'm a little bit afraid of what you're thinking and I don't want to be petted right now\nBut maybe if you give me time I Will come up to you and we can have a conversation so\nJust starting to teach people what they need to be looking for in any dog not just these bigger stronger breeds but any dog the smaller dogs will give you the same queues and so we need to be respectful of what that particular dog is trying to tell us before we just jump in wholeheartedly and\nGo oh you're so cute let me love on you or they may be adorable they may not be ready to have all that attention\nI Want to come back to us\nYou're so cute let me love on you or they may be adorable they may not be ready to have all that attention\nSo I Want to come back to ... or something and we've been fairly pit bulls while they are fantastic dogs are for everyone the quarter a lot of of energy to require a lot of activity um again while my dogs love the couch they also love going to the park and they love running and they love can hire career thanks so\nWhile we're advocating a pit bulls to be in every home or not is right for every ...\nRight and and it's very dog specific to so there's going to be different personalities with in a breed type as well and so you might have this super high energy dog that is going to do very well with certain jobs that are actually given to the dog\nAnd then other ones that might be a little bit more laid back where they do want to get out and they wanna walk but maybe they don't need all the brain games and they do want to be that intermittent couch potato with you\nSo I think we need to make sure that we're preparing the right dog personality with the right human personality and the right lifestyle\nAnd that's going to give us the best chance for a positive for ever home for these animals where we're not going to be setting them up as we've talked about before for failure we don't want to do that we want these dogs to be able to stay in their home in a loving environment where they feel safe and secure and they get the enrichment that they need\nAnd I I Do want to mention um I Know we had kind of touched on enrichment and just different things that you can\nUm just be a show you or train your dog to be the best they can be an advocate for them\nUm you know there's certain things that you can do in ... at your house if you don't have the time to take them on a walk you can type into Google\nG. I. why dog and Richmond and we'll give you all sorts of fun things you can do 'em with your dog they say that thirty minutes of enrichment is equivalent to a two hour walk so I think that's really key and that's something that we've\nReally started to love to do with our own dogs just because we don't always have that time to be able to take them for a walk and bring them to the park so there's other things you can do\nTo provide your ... give your dog that outlet um I Know one of our favorite ones is you can get a muffin ten and play tennis balls um in them and you can hide treats underneath that's always a fun game and so there's just a bunch of different things that are cheap and we'll give your dog the outlet that they need\nYeah and that's one of the things we talk about on a regular basis is keeping that brain involved in what's going on because aboard dog is a dog is going to get in trouble so when we come back we'll talk more about the bully breeds and what you can do to get involved and help out with save a bull so hang in there we'll be right back after this short break\nNothing as important as family edit idol rode animal hospitals your parents are treated like part of the family seven days a week with twenty four hour nursing care maybe that your pet will never be alone in their state of the art facility they're integrated technologies and experience veterinarians offer the best in emergency and wellness care\nOver sound acupuncture laser therapy\nFull dental and digital X ray all are performed by compassionate Terry inexperienced\nI Know road animal hospital where your pet gift to the very best quality care\nHunting for one one what is your emergency Hi yes my doctor told me if somebody prescription that a compounding pharmacy called ... sounds expensive and I have no clue what that even is yes occasional puppy carrying wellness is a locally owned compounding pharmacy that feels prescriptions for you or your pet\nAnd customize as each medication to your exact needs folic competitive prices would you like their number yes please I feel like I've been living in a home will climb mountains ... classic Harry for price close in more information at five two zero six seven zero zero seven seven seven [laughter]\nHe is I feel like I've been living in a home will climb a mountain\nCalled occasional plastic Harry for price close in more information at five two zero six seven zero zero seven seven seven\nIt's time for the head of the week bought the buddy I Know wrote animal hospital this week the week is in need of a forever home she's old little girl and\nHer name is ... ... talk about this morning it was Dr Debbie from the on the road animal hospital Dr Debbie tells about you oh she\nOh good morning you know she is a young probably close to about one one and a half year old ... old mix who has the most beautiful brown Rendell watches all over [laughter] uh\nAnd the very eager to please stay uh she's going to make somebody and amazing hiking or jogging partner\nOn she does not do well with cats and so we need to make sure she does not go to a home with cats and of course\nAny dog in the household there needs to be an introduction first to make sure everybody's going to get along and play well in the sandbox so I think that she would be a wonderful companion for somebody who plans to have an active lifestyle\nMhm well what if she wants to review and the bark the lounge or did you did there I I did go out and run [laughter]\n... you can make a great jogging partner and she's going to like your family as well but you need to make sure to go visit her at the humane society southern Arizona main campus or six three five west Roger road and\nControl you can still reach us to some degree through email maybe Facebook are text messages on but if you've got questions and you need to get a hold of us today would be the time to call our phone number at the office\nIs five four four seven seven zero zero is that tax number at the same as well yeah so you can lower the easiest way and it really is right now and we can just text you right back with any questions that you might have and we thank you for your patient and understanding as we go through this expansion process we're looking forward to being able to\nThank you so much over hunting thanks for having a you know it's been a pleasure to have you guys on the show again and hope that the hours that are in January thank you guys have to wait time\nAre we can't show info can be found at ... dot com it's a wonderful line ...

E. and we had to eat one do you eat two and three and then chewy infinity\nNow here we are and the feds have officially ended quantitative easing back in two thousand Seventeen during this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation was still very low and yes did it work\nTwo thousand Seventeen during this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation was still very low and yes did it work maybe\nBut what did this quantitative easing or this free money really give us well it gave us low interest rates and most of us have benefited from that in some sort of way\nPerhaps a lower rate on a house or a car or a business loan we've become addicted to these low interest rates\nSo has Wall Street lower rates also means low saving rates on bank money which causes us to seek higher returns elsewhere\nLike in the stock market and well that has worked wonderfully over almost a full nine years now so here we are at a critical point in our history and our economy with inflation fears now at the forefront of discussion we've already seen interest rates now taking a little higher\nWe're now seeing spikes in the yields on what most consider a risk free investment and that is the ten year treasury note\nWhen inflation starts to become a problem well the Federal Reserve will respond and the only way they know how\nAnd that is by raising interest rates and when that happens when interest rates rise that can start to put the brakes on the economy and then our whole economic cycle starts to change and our time of grow turns into a time of contraction\nNot that that's the idea of the Federal Reserve to cause a recession but it's just the nature of the beast it's economics\nAnd when that happens or there is even the slightest indication of something like that happening Wall Street is way ahead of the game on this and we'll start to see yet another bear market and perhaps one like we've never seen before where we can see drops of at least fifty percent or more\nIn the depths of the stock market bloodbath after the crash in two thousand eight early two thousand nine the Dow Jones was trading adjust sixty five hundred that was the index level\nIf we returned to those levels again\nThat's a Seventy five percent drop from where we are today so again we're at a critical point one where the stock market still just hasn't made up its mind as to what it wants to do so why risk all your portfolio on something that seems to be just pure chance\nOur message here at Mayfield financial is different at our core is that principle of financial safety safety is our number one concern and priority\nNow do all investment advisors offered this unfortunately no this type of planning or the planning that looks to take care of your essential needs first it's often not addressed\nIn this Wall Street dominated financial world that we're in too many investment advisers and individuals try to seek sky high returns and run the odds it's all probability based it's about calculating risk\nAnd hoping that a worst than worst case scenario won't ever happen during your retirement\nTo me and for all of us here at Mayfield financial that simply doesn't work\nI don't like running probabilities when it comes to retirement\nI Want certainties I Want guarantees I Want a retirement plan that puts safety first and where risk isn't measured by what stocks and bonds you have in your portfolio but as measured by their risk of losing your comfort\nYour house your income\nThese types of risks are there real risks we want to consider when planning for retirement\nSo there are many questions to answer when it comes to knowing what to do with your retirement money in your savings and how to best position yourself for the long term so what is the answer\nWell it depends it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met and want to continue the lifestyle that we're comfortable with throughout retirement\nSo here at Mayfield
