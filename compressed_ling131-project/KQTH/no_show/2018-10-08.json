Bush\nTo were nominated by the two term president to follow him Bill Clinton right\nTo wear a nominated by two term president\nGeorge W. Bush to were nominated by two term president Brock Obama\nAnd now two were nominated had been nominated by Donald John Trump in two years in two years more to come\nBut right now the balance of the court if you look at presidential elections since Ronald Reagan starting with George W. Bush he gets one as a one term president than two term president gets to two term president gets to two term president gets to Donald Trump gets too\nI saw that and he's going to get more he may get to more he could get three more but if one of them as Clarence Thomas then that's not really the same thing um because you'd be replacing a a solid rock rib conservative\nWith hopefully another solid rock brick conservative but when the lesson that they believe they've learned is that they weren't vicious and ruthless enough that they that they weren't mean enough that they didn't make it crazy enough they didn't dial it up to a hundred enough if that's the lesson that I've learned and it apparently is\nThat we can expect the city to burn now on friday Michael peers you know when we're wrapping up and preparing to leave on friday\nWe were talking about whether there would be riots in the city over the weekend\nAnd we were making a joke you know when the when they elected a new pope at the Vatican\nOr a that they take the ballots the votes the paper ballots and they toss them into a basically a wood burning fireplace and a and if the vote is no they haven't elected a new votes than black smoke comes out of the\nOut of the chimney at the Vatican and and if they have elected a new pumped on white smoke comes out and everybody out in St Peter's Square knows that that the election has selected a new pope and they stand by for the announcement of who that will be a we were thinking on friday that we may know that Kavanaugh's been voted in when we see\nSiri a series of columns of black smoke rising from the downtown Washington area\nBecause the left is here and we know they're like burning things and looting and ... and attacking people but again they uh they called off the violent dogs they're brown shirts they're black shirts they're shocked\nHobbs you know the anti for people and the and the whole rest of the the the lefty the violent lefty people uh were called off again we're we're down there on Saturday there were no antifa people at all why well because the high command ordered them to stand down\nBecause they wanted to manage the media image that uh that people saw\nAt I was there had this crazy topless guy Fox woman Elizabeth Warren was speaking when we were there and then Ed Markey the other dim wedded senator from Massachusetts was there speaking\nAnd we're having a good time making fun of them yes where you were\nA and a ... and again lots and lots of pro cabin up people are and and the total number of people what a hundred thousand\nTwo hundred three hundred thousand I'm fifty thousand twenty thousand\nTen five thousand no no more like Fifteen hundred\nAnd may be maxed out at two thousand and a lot of those where people like me who were not part of the left wing were really angry demonstration a lot of people were pro American\nAnd uh one of the ... smallest\nSo I Know that they have the ability to call up bigger more violent protests and that the party does\nBut they decided to dial it down because now the fight enters a new stage and\nMake no mistake they're not done they're planning on winning the house next month because you're not going to show up and vote and they're going to win the house and then they're going to impeach Kavanaugh which won't happen of course and that but they just they're going to spread the hate and the danger of people's lives\nBecause Hillary Clinton lost because she didn't go to Wisconsin and she's ... she's a horrible person\nShe's waking up this morning in a pool of dog vomit at home it's it's a different kind of on it every night\n[noise] the Washington Post on Saturday with a a ridiculous story about a sort of there after action review now the Democrats and the media but I repeat myself the media very upset I think this is probably got the strain the relationship between\nThe Democratic party and their activists a news media people [noise]\nBecause first of the media thought that they had won the election for the Democratic party for Hillary Clinton undefeated Donald John Trump\nAnd they were shocked shocked I said to find that Donald Trump won they won the electoral college quite handily and other Democrats are very very upset about this and um and I mentioned on friday that they're not going to try to de legitimize the Supreme Court itself and they've been busy doing exactly that ever since\nThey were ... they ... they say no there are two members of the Supreme Court who have been accused of sexual\nHarassment sexual impropriety yeah you're right by Democrats like Bill Clinton who raped Juanita Broderick and uh and wagged his weight in the face of Paula Jones that's fine but the Democrats will come on we're not getting that we've covered that that's what they say when you when you mentioned things like that 'cause it it's about the double standards and the hypocrisy\nAnd all of that good stuff\n[noise] um I ... and and it's a it's another to and and uh and they want to you know they want to impeach everybody they're they're just crazy they're really bad losers they really are\nLike um you know more of them are Duke turned
