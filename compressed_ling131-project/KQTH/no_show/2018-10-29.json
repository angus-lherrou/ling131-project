morning news with my crap Tucson news and talk [noise]\nSome mornings corresponding Veronica hosted joined this morning with all its on flu season is underway\nYeah so flu season is underway only a couple of weeks here in the county it's interesting because I think we always say oh we have an idea of flu season starts to stay in it in this day but I spoke to someone at the Pima County health department who says that's actually not the case so she says that\nFlu season there's never really start date or an end date and the way they measure it is simply by looking at those numbers whenever they start climbing as in the number of flu cases you're not when they say OK flu season is underway\nI'm right now in the county it's sporadic meaning there's only been a few cases here in their state wide there's only been fifty six reported cases of the flu since the start of the season\nSo it's not fully fully a it's high peak right now on she still recommends that this is the perfect time to go get your flu shot if that's something that you want to do a and they simply recommend getting a flu shot any time in October is a good way to kind of prevent yourself from getting the feeling of course other ways that washing your hands\nCoughing in your elbow sneezing away ... away from her face yeah don't go to work if you're sick\nHe's a washing your hands coughing in your elbow sneezing away ... away from her face yeah don't go to work if you're sick\nSure well they say anything about the characteristics the flu or or how severe it is or is just a it's just the flu\nThat's another really interesting thing so I asked her about\nUm I had seen things that people say you know it's protected to be a bad flu season she says that there is no way that they can protect that so\nThey cannot say that they think the season's going to be relatively bad they don't see that until the season's over that's when they say it was about the that there is really no way for them to measure how bad or how good the seat is going to be\nSounds like the monsoon and the flu season like common\nOr at least in terms of predictability house characterized alright so uh the bottom line is just a get out there and get their flu shot and um it's particularly important for people who have\nI'm compromised immune systems and old people and all babies and stuff like that then yeah you know what they're capable of taking the shot and they certainly should alright rocket costs are joining us on two sons morning news banks thank you\n[noise]\nTo down for to go to the construction of why grant

if he were with the caravan where Fox News discovered they wanted attempted murder over the weekend just by the way now we'll get to that in a little bit\nThen the news media certainly would throw in

ridiculous it it's just a completely absurd\nFall for it and the news media is peddling that this morning and there are peddling that yesterday\nAnd ... and then as they do this they decry the

people are not really hear things let's go to the let's go to the telephones let's go to Nick in Silver Spring Maryland Nick you're on the ... plant\nShow [noise] I crossed I'm great thank you good so\nI might you ask when I was worried about the mid term elections I'm worried about the structure of the middle class in America and the fact that\nIt seemed like neither party has any sense of how to rebuild it\nUm but I also want to just point out that I I'm an independent I'm a patriot mhm but I got to tell you when it comes to divisiveness I tune into your show every so often and stuff that you stay\nIf some of the most divisive stuff that I ever hear for example I think that at some point you got to take it on the chin mhm and take some responsibility or the way you talk to\nUh-huh well I think I Do take responsibility for the way I talk and I think I open up the lines to people like yourself who uh\nWho offer suggestions like that one and uh I think that if you listen or cross the media universe you'll find a great deal of combat going on now I don't show up when I say this all the time\nI don't show up to a fight against CNN and the Washington Post the New York times and the rest of them with a a butter knife and my hand with a spoon\nI show up to go toe to toe with them and we're the little guys in this fight may make no mistake about it and that can I think you'd probably even acknowledge that\nAnd when I show up first of all I Do a very entertaining show we take on the issues of the day and what I Do is not what CNN does or not what MSNBC does at least it's not what they're supposed to do having worked at CNN for very long time myself\nYou know most Nazis didn't actually killed Jews themselves but but nevertheless\nAh the the the absurdity and the irony of all of this that that Nick was just peddling that I'm too aggressive and that really the problem is talk radio Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing or a hundred and sixty eight innocent people were murdered\nA Bill Clinton you may remember tried to blame Rush Limbaugh and conservative talk radio\nBecause it's always somebody else's rhetoric but it's never their own rhetoric it's never you're the enemy of the people that's never Brock Obama's saying yet and yet in their faces it's it's a never Hillary Clinton and the entire Democratic Party and that means the news media to\nPainting every Republican as a racist or homophobic massaging us you know the party of the clan the party that exterminate forty percent of the black population in the womb the party of Bill Clinton you want to talk of racism and sexism\nAh let's talk Jefferson Davis and Nathan Bedford Forrest and your boys or of all four of us and George Wallace and Lester Maddox send and Bull Connor you know Democrats you want to talk of anti Semitism let's talk Brock Obama with his pal the minister Louis Farrakhan let's talk about Iraq Obama rip his pal\nOr the Reverend Jeremiah Wright who famously was asked during Brock Obama's first year and the White House whether he was going to be meeting with President Obama and Brock Obama's personal spiritual guide posed for Twenty years\nThe man that presided over his wedding baptized as children bless the property that he bought with a convicted felon Tony Rezko who shortly thereafter went to a penitentiary for his Democratic party corruption\nThe minister the Reverend Jeremiah Wright of the trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago said\nYou know the Jews aren't going to let ... talk\nStir the Reverend Jeremiah Wright of the trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago said you know the Jews aren't going to ... talk to me\nWhat it was really\nExcuse me you know them Jews ain't gonna let him talk to me just to turn it into a moral lyrical sort of thing\nAnd and and then we've got Dan Rather I looked it up he's eighty six years old Dan Rather God Bless him\nHe's eighty six years old and he's going after President Trump before the ... the the smoke cleared on Saturday the Senate got\nNot only after President Trump but going after every one that all who excuse of bats or stand in silence\nWhile hate is still for political gain do you have James Hodgkinson on tap perhaps because James Hodgkinson was a big fan of the Southern Poverty Law Center and MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and Bernie Sanders is a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nSomeone most of the ah the hated him but interestingly enough the news media did go on a day is lost high rate about the about the rhetoric of the Democratic party creating a dangerous situation for members of Congress\nAnd the Southern Poverty Law Center which is America's number one have also demonize\nThe family Research Council in Washington DC a left wing terrorist showed up there with a gun and bags full of chick fillet sandwich just\nShot one man the man was a good strong man and beat the hell out of the little left wing I'm a would be mass murderer now I mean you guys want to pretend you want to play games of make believe and this is what Nick has really upset about I think\nYou guys want to play these games or make believe we're only certain facts are introduced where we're only certain arguments are allowed to be made where counter points are are shouted down and\nAh and yelled over and and I play those all the time on CNN so you know Nick ... listen if you're actually an intelligent on a serious person you're going to come around to my way of thinking\nBecause these people are lying all the time and I'm not and there is a very very important difference there an important difference is that I'm not out here lying to you every day I'm reading facts that are inconvenient to the left wing cause of the Democratic party cause and to the news media but I repeat myself\nAh but ... you know once again Nick you have no sense of irony I think\nI'm really not the problem here uh nobody uh you know Rachel Maddow had one of her fans show up at a baseball field and start blasting members of Congress or I don't I don't have that problem the Southern Poverty Law Center\nHas launched at least two fanatics wonder the family Research Council and the second you know they\nDemonized Congressman Steve Scalise speaking of which did you see the lefty over the weekend attack Congressman Steve skull lease because Congressman Steve skill lease\nSet out a tweet about how awful the Pittsburgh tragedy is was\nAnd a lefty from Fox this is he's a he's a journalist or don't you know and ah he was out there in a heartbeat attacking Steve skull lease\nCalling him what was it David Duke he called him David Duke without the the baggage David Duke without the baggage this uh this journalists from Fox and that's considered to be our mainstream news media they attack a guy who was shot nearly to death\nBy a left wing fanatic because he expressed his condolences for the people murdered and for the family members and as a party this anti\nExpressed his condolences for the people murdered in for the family members and as a party this anti Israel party which is the Democratic party\nThis anti Netanyahu anti Israel ... sixty seven borders the party of Jeremiah Wright you know the Jews won't let Brock meet with me\nThe party of the minister Louis Farrakhan I don't think those are a bunch of Trump voters in that room when Louis against the anti Semitism going a so smell yourself Nick and your media allies\nAs well let's go to um let's go to Edward in Virginia Edward you're on the cruise plant show\nA morning person running on what I you know I'm just before I get to my point Chris real quick I was born in fifty five years ago and\nThree months after I was born John Kennedy was assassinated and I've listened to news realist about that time about what CBS News was reporting and Dan Rather happened to be recording from Texas at that time\nThere was a local news reporter in Dallas right\nAnd when the before was even known what happened to John Kennedy\nThere was reports coming up from Texas that Walter Cronkite was reporting on is that there is a right wing groups upset with Adelaide Stevenson who are confronting him and that they were worried about\nJohn F. Kennedy and so they ... the thing that the ... the fact that this type of thing where you start a you know a blaming Republicans automatically is nothing new coast even before rush\nLimbaugh you know in Oakland in the Oklahoma City bombing a ha ha ha so I\nI mean they were even hinting at it than I I could just read it I just listening to it and I can tell ya I can tell where they're going with this you know so uh\nYou know let me let me pause you there for a second if I could Europe 'cause I'm I'm smiling here a little bit you were watching Nineteen sixty three newsreel footage of CBS News on what I was there not because I Want to find this was it on YouTube or something\nExactly you find it on YouTube you find the whole thing\nAnd on the day of the day after they were winning the finger at ah at right wing groups sue ah [laughter]\nI mean if they enter up at the news where I've watched that we're interrupting is so far as ... [laughter]\nI ... it was it was ... it was before they even knew if John F. Kennedy was alive or dead wow\nYeah before that you listen to it and you'll hear them oh yeah well there you know at least the concern was down in Texas and he was having confrontations you know he was ambassador to the un at that time you know he and then there were some right wing groups who are upset with him who are confronting him over some ... ... you know et cetera so they weren't making this that\nAnd Edward what what were the politics of the men that killed John F. Kennedy\nI yeah he's a Marxist\nCommunist Cuba Soviet Union loving communist like Bernie Sanders\nMary he was married to he got married to a a to a woman from the survey\nYeah marina yes the Russian she's a Soviet\nYeah war bride yeah mail order bride\nYeah I and I I don't think this woman had anything to do with it but this fascination though I mean primary from what I've read she had she had no nothing but at any rate he had his he you know he it showed where his liberty for the guy was not job to begin with you know like any right he was a Marxist and that's that's\nWho yeah well that's fascinating that's that's fascinating I'm Glad you're sure that I got to go look for that too\nYeah yeah I got a lot of it I mean in in ... in terms of you know in terms of hey you know what you guys have the media ... the the the problem is your problem is that you don't want anybody competing\nYou know what you guys have the media ... the the the problem is your problem is that you don't want anybody competing with your narrative and that's really the ... and I'm I'm not buying it OK yeah\nAnd a lot of America at least half of us aren't buying it either so you know you know just the way it is right when I go to when I get to the polls is next week or\n... you know to me it's about ... what's gonna be strengthen the economy going forward ever since Donald Trump taking the reins of president\nThis economy has skyrocketed and I you know and it's because of his influence its policies it was that I I felt that the nation was being held back for eight years that the nation want it to search for it\n[noise] [noise] Hey Chris thanks for taking my call you about that like like you I probably I came from a liberal family uh from New York I'm Jewish and I think that\nOr water or a pro grew up they\nGot started for Russia my family they put you crave my family gave them\nThe hungry ... is a blob out loud [noise] well and\nHe's he's the big anti Semite they don't evidently said so they just go about anti Semite as though you already know and I have that audio coming up as a matter of fact a dog\nFrom the fraudsters morning joke a this morning [noise] um his daughter Yvonne draw the blonde one she converted to Judaism they're orthodox\nOn the only plant continues next time your mid term election destination the heaviest he's won over one ... the ... time\nABC News\nI'm Scott Goldberg demand accused of opening fire inside of Pittsburgh synagogue killing eleven people has been released from the hospital Robert Bowers is expected in federal court this afternoon where he faces twenty nine charges including murder and hate crimes rabbi Jeffrey Myers was leading a service at the tree of life synagogue when the attack happened and he tells ABC News when\nAmerican citizens cannot [noise]\nReally and safely worship\nIn their house of worship and celebrate their Sabbath then it's not just an attack on just the Jewish community [noise] this is an attack upon all Americans a deadly\nRampage has triggered high alerts that synagogues across the country according\nTo the Anti Defamation league the number of anti Semitic incidents dumped a stunning fifty seven percent from two thousand sixteen to two thousand Seventeen and just last friday a new report showed as we head to the midterms there's been a spike in negative rhetoric on social media targeting Jews especially Jewish journalist\nABC News chief justice correspondent Thomas Cesar ... the man arrested for sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump also expected in court this afternoon this comes as another possible devices been discovered in the u._s. postal inspection service notifying the FBI of yet another suspicious package\nThis time address to CNN in Atlanta the package was intercepted edited land area post office and the preliminary assessment is that it is similar to the other pipe bomb like devices sent last week\nIf confirmed to be related to those other packages that would make Fifteen total devices ABC's mark rental art in Miami the national Transportation Safety board is sending a team of investigators to Indonesia after Boeing seven thirty seven crash this morning\nOn one hundred eighty nine passengers on board are believed to be dead in North Carolina a student has died after being shot inside butler high school this morning near Charlotte the suspected shooter has been arrested\nOn Wall street the Dow is up one hundred eight points the NASDAQ is fourteen you're listening to ABC News\nThings you find the latest coverage online anytime one oh four one K.

[noise]\nHas been arrested for that crime he's part a seminal Indian and Bert Filipino [noise] so the news media just doesn't\nSay tastes are because it's too ethnic they want to strip him of his ethnicity kind of like George Zimmerman it's the same program they have with that they're all very racist everything must be pushed through the the city of of racism of of ethnicity of race before they settle\nAnd then on Saturday and and again I'm Glad we caught that creepy is a a nut case a mental case law and criminal history long history of ah\nOf even bomb threats in the past one against the electric company threatened to blow up the electric company over some issue had with the you know the power company and uh so he's not he's a cook\nAnd his apparently a Trump fan so we set up these these fake bombs that none of them were that were aware of where capable of actually detonating capable of going off for whatever reason we don't know for sure that story of course fell by the wayside on Saturday\nWhen a horrible massacre took place at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nPennsylvania and um and the news media as we know are only capable of talking about in covering one story at a time\nAnd this horrible story emerged on on Saturday and there were eleven people killed at this\nThe anti police rhetoric Brock Obama and the Democrats led directly to that and to Dallas where five police officers were murdered and I think seven more wounded to Baton Rouge or three or was it for more were murdered and another suicide attacks suicide attacks suicide attacks\nAnd the anti place rhetoric of course was never the problem in the news media all the Democrats and Obama and the anti play there everybody's racist other place to raise his\nHands up don't shoot never happened never that and and that's from Eric Holder who says when they go low we kick them\n... and and that rhetoric never manifest itself in any way all the political violence to the left over the last several years now are not really a part of their record ... none of it went on their permanent record none of that goes on their report card as far as the media is concerned\nIt's it's truly extraordinary and I put that question out this morning\nAbout whether or not what it is that you're going to be voting about what it is you're going to be when you go into the voting booth a week from tomorrow what is it that's going to be going through your mind what is it that you're thinking about now when it comes to when it comes to voting and and MS DNC this morning\nI turn them out at six am I on the DVR I can do all kinds of magic tricks\nAnd I looked at them within the first five six minutes\nThere were at least four or five pushes to get out the vote for the Democrats\nAnd there's no Yarborough guy I I guess he used to be a Republican or something they're they're literally five or six four four or five in the first five or six minutes pushes to get out the vote you have to I have at least one of those that are going to get to this morning\nHey [noise] if you're like most people that I Know that you are and you're driving along and you you see two gas stations one is selling gas for less

some money here and there\nBut sometimes we save a few cents here and there and we forget about the fact that we can save huge money in other areas life changing amounts of money if you switch to met a share for your health care it could mean massive saving for you and for your family\nThe savings for a typical family it's about five hundred dollars a month to think about that\nThat's about six thousand dollars a year that's after tax money that's serious money and people love met a share because met a share works met a share as believers you share each other's healthcare across\nThere are

Administration official a a a former Democrat Capitol Hill staffer\nA lifelong Democrat political an apparatus pick of the Democratic party and then he was hired by ABC News to become their chief anchor and spent sixteen hours a week on air or is it Twenty one hours I Can't remember a buddy he's a he's a Democrat\nAnd he's a funny little fella and he was on television yesterday\nAnd of course it's a there was a massacre and it's all Trump's will buy a Trump hater he's an anti Semite I see no reason to believe that Trump is an anti Semite\nAnd ah the news media doesn't care about that they just got their brush all this stuff out about the killer being anti Trump and hating Trump and saying Trump is controlled by the Jews on the international Jewish conspiracy they just leave all that out\nBecause you have to remember the most insidious power the news media has the power to ignore\nAnd they've been doing a lot of that this weekend because they're extremely corrupt [noise]

you think he's Hitler and then if you say don't be ridiculous they say it's not that hate speech\nBecause of people like George Stephanopoulos being hired by ABC and kept cities and Disney to pretend to be an objective journalist when everyone knows that he's not he is a a Clinton Administration official\nTo pretend to be an objective journalist when everyone knows that he's not\nHe is a a Clinton

rice and has made from the news media didn't care about that when congressman state's college was shot in an attempt at mass assassination by a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nThe news media didn't really spend a lot of time on that these are not big stories these are not a big deal\nThey were all motivated by left wing rhetoric\nAnd I don't like the term hate speech because it's a lie and pretty much
