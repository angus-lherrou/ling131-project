saying the source told me he\nA three minute version of the audio tape has been given to the Turkish newspapers some bar but they have yet to publish it\nA Turkish source told the New York times that

they used acid\nOr you know old so they called in the wool fake called in Harvey ... tell and they created the s a bad thing to do away with the ah the parts and there's a story also that the Saudis the team recorded it\nWhich would be pretty gruesome too but perhaps to show to whoever it is that sent them to be satisfied it reminds me of one of the attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler\nOr one of the unfortunately unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler the the the ... the conspiratorial were rounded up and they were executed as you might expect some were allowed to commit suicide in certain cases but they executed the number of the conspirators\nAnd Adolf Hitler couldn't be present for at least a couple of the executions so they filmed the executions for them so that he could see them later at least a couple where they hang up or Hitler's enemies with piano wire\nAnd Hitler wanted to watch the films of this so is print psalm on the the uh the culprit here behind the

exceeding number of unemployed Americans what's that we have more job openings than we have unemployed people yes that's exactly right\nFurther more as Jeffrey ... cash at marketwatch writes Americans are quitting their jobs at fastest pace in Seventeen years\nNow you'd say well what does that have to do with any\nWhy would people quitting their jobs to be a positive indicator it's a very positive\nBecause they're confident that they can go get another job\nIf you're afraid that if you lose your job you can't get another job then you hold on to your job like it's a life raft because you want to keep the electricity on because little Timmy is going to need some porridge in the bowl and at Christmas Time he's going to need GI Joe with kung fu grip\nIt's another Eddie Murphy reference and and [laughter]\nAnd ah so people hold on to their jobs but in a very strong economy people say\nScrew this job take this job and shut up I can go get another job and you know what that means that means employers are going to look more fondly upon their employees are as Democrats call us workers and they're going to say well we can't afford to lose people in this job market we might lose people\nSo we're going to have to be more generous [noise] the number of job openings\nIn the United states rose slightly to our record\nSeven point one for a million in August reflecting strong growth for the economy and the best labor market in decades oh this is not the White House putting up this press release this was marketwatch not a conservative outlet\nJob openings top seven million in July for the first time ever\nLet me just pause there for a second\nRevised figures show and they increased again in August President Trump was quick to tell the record level of job openings\nThough he actually cited a lower number so even money or you know it's got hit they got it wrong or you got it wrong because there are more job openings than he said the jobs still waiting to be filled meanwhile easily exceeded the number of people officially classified as unemployed\nThe government previously said six point two or three million people unemployed in August job openings topped the number of unemployed for the first time in march based on government records going back to two thousand\nThe gap has now widened to a record nine hundred thousand you're the word record here again and again and again\nThe economy is that in ... it is booming it is going wild and the news media isn't going to tell you about it because it's good news for Trump and Republicans in their mid term elections coming up\nAnd they want to make sure that the Democrats do as well as the media can make the Democrats do so they're not going to talk about how great the economy isn't how everything's booming and how many records are being set all over the place on the economy here's another\nOne oh and ... also yeah given my this is your you remember that the Democrats and you have the ... thing right now the ...\nWhen they were a bum rushing Obamacare through on a strict party line in the middle of the night on a holiday weekend oh what a shame that whole thing was the news media loved it there are very very corrupt Nancy Pelosi was out there saying that Obamacare\nObamacare would liberate you from your job you wouldn't have to be tied to your job you could go out and become a poet or a harmonica player on the street corner and realize you're a lifelong dream of being a nothing nobody\nA useless ... lying on the tax payer teach which is what Democrats love they want more of those because those are all democratic voters Nancy Pelosi\nWas the entrepreneur oil bill it's yellow that fast someone if you want to entrepreneurial from being the fishing or what\nFocus on your parents are stealing a passing aspiration that he was home health care and you don't have to be job ...\nJob block to you're going to have to be job blocked a even play the do grow on a street corner and everyone will love you the world will be the path to your a homeless shelter in the store front of an abandoned [noise]\nUh I Know the reality is that President Trump forget about this left wing economic stuff and you get a a it's an entrepreneurial bill because other people are paying for your health care and\nYou're getting subsidized by people that go to work so you can play the Jews harp on the corner I was like the Jews are what's with that is just so they call it ... and\nUh and that's what the Democrats were going for with Obamacare apparently that didn't work very well and uh hey what did what did your health insurance go up to 'em what a disgrace but now a Donald Trump's economic plans have actually created a situation where many many millions and millions of people are not\nJob blocked job blocked it's a you know is that ... that job blocked or [laughter] dental damn I don't know what they're they're ... job blocked nobody's job blocked a about Obamacare was going to liberate us from being job lock and now the reality is the Democrats in Obamacare\nDidn't liberate anyone from being job blocked it just redistributed wealth and stole from one group of people to give to another group of people like a criminal Robin Hood fakes a so they can buy votes of stupid people who want free stuff and ah you know it's the opposite of an entrepreneurial bill but that's what they say that you don't have to be job law\nNo job locked well millions and millions of Americans thanks to President Trump\nAnd again the timeline is two thousand eight that we were no longer the most competitive and now we are again what changed\nWhat what'd you say we were the most competitive under George W Bush than we had that Wall Street thing and then Obama became president and way we're not the most competitive and now we are again what what do you think that is I Can't imagine\nThere's another one the Reuters news agency out of Chicago Illinois United States steel corporation you know US Steel perhaps you've heard of the\nWorkers they call them workers United states steel workers it is the United steelworkers union after all\nAre set to get the biggest wage jump in at least six years under a new deal negotiated with the company providing early signs that gains from US President Donald Trump's clamp down on foreign imports are finally\nTrickling down or did it not happen fast enough for you [laughter] as I said well you can't have terrorists the terrorists have worked every time every single time\n... with Canada with Mexico they're working and he's and he's building toward China building building it's working it's working right and this is what they ... I could go find you a hundred stories saying that this would never happen and\nHere it is the Reuters news agency reported ... it's going to die in the wilderness of fake journalism\nThe agreement reached on Monday proposes a cumulative fourteen percent wage increase over a four year period three sources familiar with the details of the negotiations told Reuters on Tuesday\nWages were ... wages were frozen in the last contract which ended September first as the Pittsburgh based company was suffering losses from a slump and the domestic steel domestic steel prices so here is the uh\nAnd uh they're thrilled and it's great and all the stuff that the news media told you about how it was going to lead to a terrible results and there would be no ... and the terrorists would be bad for everybody and they lose their jobs all be us you can go back you can look at the story's what the Democrats and\nThe news media but I repeat myself were saying about President Trump's approach to dealing with economic problems with trade using the ... as a tool and then\nDing ding ding win win win with Mexico forcing Canada to the table renegotiating NAFTA benefiting the United states and our employees are citizens are taxpayers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Tucson", "day": "17"}
