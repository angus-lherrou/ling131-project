that ... has a link to some uh bin Laden not one link links to our summer bin Laden did you know that\nDid you know that ... has links to the Muslim Brotherhood that you know that long time links to

only ... and the only reason he's done that is because the Muslim Brotherhood and the ... hobbies are in conflict with one another and he's a Brotherhood guy\nSo he's probably out of a bronco Obama supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt over our thirty year ally Hosni Mubarak who had kept the peace in the middle east for a generation\nI'm ... I'm a big trade him Mubarak ended up in prison and all of our allies in the region and around the world went running for cover when they saw Brock Obama during that\nBut never mind all that a couple of interesting things about this ... the whole uh chop chop square\nA fact I'm the interesting things that I Want to get into ... to show you anybody remember the famous arms dealer famous arms dealer not a lot of famous arms dealer but a ... was one famous arms dealer or Saudi arms deal in the Nineteen eighties\nMade a lot of news for a variety of reasons and that turns out ... years the cousin of a non ...\nAnd um and there are some interesting ties there a non ... shows cousin is on it you know there's a lot of that going on over there are a lot of his cousins and uncles and nephews stuff going on in Saudi Arabia\nBut his is a cousin of ... who's now deceased um which means that um he's related to the\n... family\nYou know do the al ... who killed the Princess Diana so there is I I think there's room for all kinds of Internet conspiracy stuff here and I'll get into again and so now the Internet conspiracy stuff but some of that stuff a little bit later on this morning as well\nAnd in the meantime we we need you know next time a Democrat wins the White House I assume it'll happen someday you'll remember when uh Obama was in the Democrats were saying the Republicans would never win the White House again\nThat's because that lie all the time because they they have a fertile imaginations that's why they run Hollywood and they do a lot of dress up and make believe sometimes just at home behind closed doors with the curtains close but sometimes in Hollywood and on TV and in the movies and stuff too\nAnd um they said that the Republicans would never owned the White House you gotta never control Congress again and it's just because they lie about everything all the time\nBut the next time there's a Democrat in the White House and and they're presumably will be\nUm and it will be a terrible day for humanity when that happens but it it's likely to happen anyway we need to form like Romney's raiders and ah you know the McCain resistance front and then whoever the Republican as that loses to the Democrat in the presidential race\nNeeds to form a resistance group ... cell group an underground network of operatives inside and outside the government\nTo do everything they can to disrupt a the agenda of the Democratic president and destroy them as a party\nAnd destroy their ah people their leaders their followers their family members destroy them all and all the while Brett Kavanaugh will be at a homeless shelter feeding the poor the indigent the needy\nBecause he's a good and decent man whereas Bill Clinton with a cigar in the White House it's like a colonel mustard and the and the\nLibrary with a ranch but it's Bill Clinton and the oval office where the cigar and and I love all these fraudulent clown a left days yesterday that Kanye West has brought disgrace to the oval office and they're sitting there wearing Bill Clinton T shirts and they said they got Bill Clinton underwear on uh these\nAnd you're a west has brought disgrace to the oval office and they're sitting there wearing Bill Clinton T shirts and they said they got Bill Clinton underwear on a these reporters when they said this and I love that you know they love Anthony wiener and Eliot Spitzer or this or they they protected\nHarvey swine Steen day these are these are not good people not good people at all\nAnd they're bringing us to a very bad place but we get to the Michael Eric Dyson who um you know what what is the uh white supremacist Ventura liquids seven assist\nOr whatever ... likes to make things right and um and you may remember that Michael Eric Dyson awhile back you know Rachel dollars all the white black woman\nNow this is all areas of these people are insane ...

in comparative religion and mythology and he wrote that book called the hero with a thousand faces and it's all about the hero's journey where it's like a twelve step journey um and a lot of movies
