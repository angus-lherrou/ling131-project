painting\nIn restoration so give him a call again that seven for for for for five for spectrum I never wrote article Asian they'll take good care yeah [noise]\nSo we were talking about you know maintenance and different things um [noise] you brought up a question about a GED I vehicle um and to what was it why why are we putting clear and the fuel additive fuel additive antibodies that recommended from the dealer\nWell one thing it's cleaning the injector and\nYes you know your question was correct that the fuel additive isn't been actually clean\nThe intake valve because on a GED I it's gas direct injected it's it's injecting the fuel directly into the combustion chamber not onto the intake valves like the old style pork fuel injected a port feel injections where they inject is located in the intake port\nAnd then it's sprayed onto the intake valves\nAnd you know that type of system you can clean with the motive act system where we hook into the fuel lines and run the cleaners through the ... it's always good to run this clean up through the ... to keep the fuel lines cleaned the injector screens cleaned the injector panels clean\nBut I'm back to the GED I vehicles I have a new way of cleaning the intake valves which consists of\nI inject cleaner through the throttle\nA new way of cleaning the intake valves which consists of\nI inject cleaner through the throttle body where it's sucked into the engine and then it goes by the intake valves\nAnd I've had good success with this um I've done it on a few different vehicles now they've won F. one fifty come in that had a a random cylinder ... zero three hundred\nAnd you can actually feel it in the body the vehicles the engines running rough um he was a do it yourself very unique put his set a new plugs in that he needed a new spark plug boots and everything so you know it wasn't a specific cylinder was just a random miss fired had over a hundred thousand miles on it\nAnd the problem with this vehicle was as he had it it was a GED I and it had a ... a carbon built up on the intake valves\nSo we went in and we fog this chemical in through the throttle body and it got a little better and so I called him up and I says hey let's do this again\nSo we fog that chemical in twice\nAnd it run better run smoother you couldn't hardly feel it run at all\nIn fact he called a few days later and he says the truck hasn't run that good in quite a while so we do have procedures now that we can [noise] you know clean these gas direct injected vehicles up and get the carbon off those intake valves but you need to do this on a regular basis I I mean [noise]\nLet's see General Motors uh they're recommending to what was it\nEvery three to five thousand miles to put some cleaner in the fuel tank and you know get this uh flogging chemical injected into the engine at least annually well let's go to the phones we got\nPatrick on the line hello can you hear me yeah are you doing this morning\nI'm fine uh the the Toyotas not doing quite well it's a it's a Nineteen\nNinety hammer you recently said the ... and the brake power Bruce or replace [noise] and ah you have to step\nDown on the brake pedal quite a bit harder than you do at a dumb break power grocery whistle rebuild that was put in there\nSo the brake pedal is harder than normal yeah this is the brake pedal do this\nTurn your car often depress the brake pedal\nDuring the car off the press the break\nAnd remember how that felt and then start the car and depress the brake pedal\nIf the pedal feels the same as it did when you press the brake pedal is the engine off you've got a problem with the break loose ah that makes sense okay\nYeah that that are what you said makes a lot of [noise] a these are rebuilt a break boosters I Do they uh often fail or are they often have malfunctions\nIt is twenty eight teams [noise] um yes you can buy parts that aren't good right out of the box\nYeah uh I wondered ah ah the scars like Twenty years old but I can still find them at certain drunk or to like pull apart in Arizona polling save [noise] ah ... one that old out of a junk yard be a a good prospect\nI wouldn't recommend it um if it was my Toyota I Would find a ... a good re manufactured one that has a warranty on it um\nAnd go that route I mean breaks are pretty important I Want to make sure that I had a good break booster\nYeah there is really important [noise] ah well is there a a good ...\nBut I mean breaks are pretty important I Want to make sure that I had a good break booster\nYeah there are extremely important uh well is there a good brand new like if you're looking for a rebuild venture and all that good a good name is ...\nAnd my experience has been um when you're buying or rebuild like do you want to get a good name brand company\nAbsolutely I like the Jasper engines they've got a good warranty three years hundred thousand miles\n[laughter] you're like a a transfer of a break loose or\nNot

one ten forty one\nYear we supposed to give out racing tickets I don't have any racing to if it's do you\nOr I can probably get some well then surely against some out give some out let's do that let's give what a for that what you guys do ... ... family for a pack or something like that to him for four packs oh come on got Fifteen twenty minutes calling\nSides I Know they're down to a handful of races last a sit in the end of the season uh they are scheduled to race tonight at Tucson a Raceway park I Believe it might be called\nSo we'll take the second call or the second call her wins family four pack the tickets to Tucson Raceway\nAgain give us a call seven five one ten forty one that's seven five one ten forty one you know we were talking about batteries and in them failing and you know why does a battery failed as a battery fail because the battery fails or did it have some help\nGenerally has helped doesn't it\nIt generally has some help um you know I've had people calling me and say well all I Need battery that's all I Need\nGenerally has helped doesn't it it generally has some help um you know I've had people call me and say well all I Need to battery that's all I Need well what if I just put a battery and don't test the charge starting in charging system in and then the following day you need to jumpstart again that's why I say tests for stone pass\nA law how 'bout that people put in the wrong batteries in their vehicles this is an old school anymore no it's on a back\nIn the day you just went over to that shelf and said ... just give me the cheapest batter you got over there mhm I'll take one of those with him dual terminals on them they looked pretty cool and drop it in your car\nAnd it doesn't work anymore [noise] see the problem is is location to location of the battery a lot of these battery trays are built to specific size to take a certain battery and no other\nUm there's another thing that's coal cranking apps how much reserved power does that battery have I mean you're driving a computer with wheels\nWith miles and miles of wires multiple computers it needs to have the proper reserve voltage to keep that vehicle running and not stress out the charging system on the other hand yeah worked out for Nader and a hundred percent all the time now just believe it or not\nIn all native is a battery maintain are not a battery charger charger okay you can't take can have a dead battery\nAnd jumpstart it and then take off and drive you can do it if you'd like but you're going to put so much strain on that all native you could take it out or damage it so it's back to you know tests personal gas if you've got to\nA battery that's gone dead did it go dead because it went dead or did it have help so do a starting and charging system test checked that battery\nMaybe it needs to be charged and then re checked after you've done that that's a good idea to check the starter you know what is the average draw on that started when you turn the key there was a specification for that what about the ... NATO\nIs putting out the proper and bridge you know if it's a hunter damp all ... all Nader I'd expected to put out a hundred ... forty when it's loaded [noise] you know another thing you need to do is check for a parasitic draw a parasitic draws a very simple test where you can ... meter on\nAnd you find out after everything's gone to sleep we call it meaning everything is turned off\nWhat is that ... there's a suspect for that too and if it's too much than powers being taken away from your battery while everything's turned off\nNow after you've done all those tests and if everything's in specification than you can rest assured that yeah that new batteries can last a long time because everything else is working as it should\nSo again tests versus don't guess and also keep them battery cables clean and tight now this thing you want to take a look at it under your hood is that serpent team belt\nThat's you know one of those things out of sight outta mind to [noise] um they should have only one ... three inches going across the groups that the suspect for that um some of these belts though you know they won't have cracks in them\nBut the grooves in that belt are far too deep um they make a little tool to measure that you could probably run down to Merrill's they probably got one on the front counter that you could purchase or they may give you I I don't know but uh there's a tool that you can measure the groups\nTo see how deep they are because if it gets those groups get too deep than its ability to grip all the police is not there anymore and you could have a squeaky bell or how you know that would be\nAbility to grip all the police is not there anymore and you could have a squeaky bell\nOr how you know that would be you know the first started the day generally is when that Belt's gonna squeak because the battery voltage gone down a little bit and the old leaders got to work a little bit harder right away to you know charge things back up so you could have a little squeak when you first started\nNoticing that wears out this one's a ... you know getting big outta sight outta mind is the belt pension or\nYou know that built police been sitting there spinning and spinning and that spring inside the tension has been trying to keep that belt tight for how long\nHave you seen that they have these belt kids now which is the tension or that I learned the belt or because they finally realize hey you know other components are wearing out as fast as your belt here and they go hand in hand\nYeah and the ... you know there's you know the tension there the tension or police or the idol of police for that built there was a lot of things when you get the bill talk you want to take a look at all those police you know maybe ... spending by hand see how they if they move freely they should not squeak\nOr they should not sound like they have square ... yeah they show smooth Yup I mean so it's a good you know another thing that's good to take a look at is if you've got that belt off\nLook at the pulley alignment we actually have a little tool\nIt's a little a laser one that little laser beam than we got from day go that's not the one you ... you teach your dog with ... not the one you Jake you take your dog with this but it's actually uh we got it from bagel belt use them and it sits in the groups\nOf the police and you can just shine right down at the other police and see if they're all in the line item you can come in\nI'm just yesterday where things weren't aligned belt came off the actual the harmonic balance or actually ... and started to walk off the front of the motor does the ... was off the belt came off in he was riding on a tow truck\nSo it's a good idea to you know take a look at the alignment of these police make sure they're all straight\nUm you know take a look at the belt to and see if the edges are warned afraid um if they're Warner afraid you might have a problem with a belt or the ... so\nJust little things to think about and to look at and pay attention let's go back to the lines phone line here we got pat on the line it's got a battery question\nWith respect to pass whenever I didn't have any symptoms I go somewhere and I would come out yet and onto the chip away from many many years\nSo I'm here and there does it it's kind of lived in California\nSo I'm about to take with company that

for the past has slumped on has gotten so much heat and it can't really tell until later\nYeah and so people will be walking their dogs and their dogs might stop walking during the process and they don't understand what what's going on we need to keep going and then they get home and their dog just wants to lay down doesn't really want to get up and move in a day or two later we will see them and yes the skin is peeling off the bottom of those fads\nVery uncomfortable because you can imagine now we have raw skin um that's exposed and we know dogs have to walk on it you know just like we would if we burn the bottoms of our feet we still have to get up and move around on them and it's not comfortable if you\nI remember as a kid I used to run around barefoot down the streets where I grew up and you know being a kid you're just having fun playing\nAnd then you realize that you've got blistered feet later on and yeah it hurts and so the same thing is true for our pets\nKnow being a kid you're just having fun playing and then you realize that you've got blistered feet later on and yeah it hurts and so the same thing is true for our pets\nI was just thinking of a last week I mean we're at the pool and just the white top was too hot to walk on so I imagine transferring out to a black asphalt right roadway or would be way too hot right now\nAnd we talked a a while ago about even the dirt gets hot out here um you know all run outside to do something real quick thinking oh it's just a couple of minutes and I'll be outside and not frozen shoes on and regret that decision and the same is true for our dogs you know we have to send them outside to do their business\nDuring various times of the day so we want to make sure that there is plenty of shade available to them\nThere are different opportunities for you to put up shade structures for your pet if you don't have a shaded patio\nYou can get those umbrellas that are weighted down that you can open for them of course the wind out here can sometimes try to blow those things away so it's take that into consideration there are the vinyl sales that you can put up\nA shade trees are always a good option you can even build is shaped structure for your pet to make sure that they have a place that they can go safely outside if they need to use the facilities during the middle of the day when it's hot outside [noise]\nNow we've got the dogs who drifted watery saliva that's normal but when it starts to get roped me and they're obviously kinda smack in their lives they're slowing down kind of discussed yeah it's pretty disgusting when they start to get [laughter]\nSo you know when there's a difference we actually want to stop them from getting to that point but if you're noticing that they've got that thick Robie drilled they're breathing heavily\nUm they're trying to lay down they don't have as much energy get them out of the sun as soon as possible\nIf you have a way of cooling them down with some water start doing that offer them small amounts of water frequently to make sure that they're not going to vomit it back up because sometimes they can try to slow down way too much water at one point\nOver to send their stomach or they're already feeling kind of nauseous just from the heat itself and they can bomb at that water back up and that's obviously counterproductive to what we want to be doing\nSmall amounts frequently of cool water if you have it available to you get them out of the sun if you can let them down with some cool water\nNot every voter yet ice water is don't do ice water [laughter] there's a lot of controversy over that one human medicine they will say hey put them in an ice bath\nVeterinary medicine goes back and forth between whether or not to do ice paths or not but we have seen pets get cooled down too quickly\nAnd we actually see more problems develop with rapid temperature changes like that so we can go from extremely hot to way to cool\nAnd we see more Oregon damage associated with that than we would if we cool them down rapidly but not too quickly\nSo once you've gotten them out of the heat and hopefully gotten them to drink some water now it's time to get them to your veterinarian because it is still very important that they see a veterinarian because you may not know how high their internal body temperature it's gotten\nBy the time they get to us we may not even know how high their internal body temperature got to before they saw us because you may have an effective at calling them down\nBut what we're going to be doing is assessing their current mutation status so are they bright alert and responsive or are they lethargic and poorly responsive are they what we would call stupor it's where they only come around if we're really trying to agitate them and get their attention or the comatose\nObviously the less mentally aware that they are the worst the prognosis\nWe're also going to be getting that body temperature and finding out how high it is and then trying to extrapolate based on what you've been able to do before you get them to us how high could that body temperature have been because it gives us an idea on prognosis on treatment\nReal quick or what is an old though if they can take a buddy covered home what is normal what should they be worried but I Do a gets a little warm right when I was there a line that they'd have to worry\nAbout there can be so normal body temperature for textbook normal it's one at one point five which is obviously higher than a human's normal body temperature another kid is feel them and say no you know because they dilate their capillaries on their skin just like we can in an effort to try to do the conduct of heat loss\nAnd yet they can feel warm but their internal body temperature may not actually be above normal and there are some variations\nAnd yet they can feel warm but their internal body temperature may not actually be above normal\nAnd there are some variations in that body temperature and when you have an exercising dog that body temperature can actually get excessively high so if you were to be working with a dog outside and stopped him in mid exercise and take their temperature you might be surprised how high it got one for one oh five\nBut they're acting completely normal are they acclimated to that type of behavior they might be especially our search and rescue dogs are working dogs he might be acclimated to exercising and getting their body temperature up that high but not have gotten it if you take your couch dog and go exercise and then of one off or maybe not that's not a good thing [noise]\nSo the body temperature that really concerns us the most that can lead to Oregon damage is one of five point eight or above and it's also how long has it been that high\nSo short periods of time elevated body temperature or not as damaging as prolonged elevated body temperature once we hit one oh nine we have severe organ damage\nAn excessive amount of information that occurs in the body and a poor prognosis and we do have animals that will come in and we can't read their body temperature because it's so high or thermometers can only go to a certain level usually gets one oh nine maybe some thermometers one ten\nBut you can imagine a hundred and ten degrees outside is hot imagine if your own body was that hot how uncomfortable that would be and you can't cool down\nAnd the type of damage that now is occurring internally with all the organ systems including the brain and we usually see those animals come in comatose\nAnd it's a very very poor prognosis if they come in like that so again if you're worried get them out of the heat and get them out of the heat as soon as possible start calling them down and get them to a veterinarian so that we can assess what's going on\nIn a lot of cases we can cool them down and monitor again there are ... get some blood work done on them because we want to see what their mortgage function looks like we can see kidney dysfunction we can see liver dysfunctions we can see clotting abnormalities\nComplete blood count abnormalities where they're read some numbers they're platelet counts those are usually the first things that we are going to see potentially become abnormal depending on how severe the heat stroke is\nAnd then we're going to be giving them flew a therapy to try to resuscitate them what happens in\nActual heat stroke cases is that systemic inflammatory response that they get\nWill allow fluids to leak outta their vascular system and so instead of it circulating around and keeping our blood pressure nicer normal now we've got fluids is kind of leaking out of veins and so we get\nA demo or fluid buildup in arch issues including around the organs which affects their ability to function and now we also don't have as much fluid in our veins that we need to have in order to maintain normal blood pressure normal blood flow to those organs systems\nSo we really need to give them fluids and a lot of fluids to try to resuscitate them it's one of the things that we will also do to help bring that body temperature down\nIf you've ever had to be in the hospital and they're giving you I'd be fluids a lot of times you feel a little cold [laughter] giving to your cause of fluids or room temperature\nAnd room temperature is usually in the seventies and so yes that's a little chilly but it's one of the ways that we can help bring the temperature down on that pet as well we have different ways of cooling them down in the hospital where usually going to go ahead and get them\nWedded down on the areas of their body where they're going to be more likely to radiate the heat off of their body will also put some cool packs and [noise]\nOn on the areas of their body where they're going to be more likely to radiate the heat off of their body will also put some cool packs and they're growing area in their armpit area and maybe up around her head and neck\nAnother consideration with a similar to when you are yourself which you have a boy or a tower so they'll put their aspect directly on the ... because\nIt can cause or basically it's so cold burns or heat burns if we're trying to warm them up which obviously in this case or not but um and you know one of the things that we are going to be doing is also monitoring how that body temperature is coming down and again what their ... status is doing during that cooling down process\nWe don't want to over cool them because it is very easy to actually over shoot the process so we're actually going to stop the cooling process once their body temperature is it reaches about a hundred and three to a hundred and three point five because they will continue to cool down but we need to take away that external effort of trying to cool them down\nIf they come in so this is a little counter intuitive but if they come in and see us and they're already hypo ceramic so their body temperatures below that one oh one five hundred hundred and one point five\nThat actually is a poor prognostications Decatur\nThat tells us that their body has actually started to shut itself down and we're going to see\nA higher incidence of pets not survive the process so we really do need to be cautious about how we're calling them and again we've got to see them right away because the sooner we can intervene the better chance we have of being able to pull them through the situation\nBut again the severity will determine whether or not they're going to survive this\nMerger side so to obstruct justice shoots as well or if it's been long enough you need to support their body functions as well\nRight and so what we can end up having is what we call acute kidney injury so they may come in with normal kidney function and in a day or two have\nReally poor kidney function and not be able to produce Sharon anymore which means they're not filtering out their blood the way that they need to\nWe can see liver dysfunction associated with this again we're going to see this inflammatory reaction throughout the body\nAnd so we get a condition where the body starts to clot more than it should utilize all those clotting factor is because of this inflammatory reaction and then they start to actually bruising bleed\nSo unfortunately forget to that point it's it's not a good situation is really hard to pull them out of that kind of situation\nBut they're likely going to be in the hospital for a few days\nThey may need blood products they may need plasma to help support their protein since we're now leaking things all over the body and so if\nYou think about it it's basically like you just had heat stroke or heat stress and you've been in the hospital and you're going to be in there for a little while while you try to recover [noise]\nAnd as we just talked about it doesn't take long before that interior temperature gets high enough to create internal damage to your pet\nWe've heard about people who accidently forget their kids in the car\nAnd they come out and realize that this has happened um and the devastating effects associated with that well unfortunately this still happens with our pets to where you get distracted very easily going about your daily business and accidentally leave them in the car\nAlways always always double check turn around and looked and remind yourself as everybody out of the car\nAnd if you're planning on running errands\nMake sure if you're going to take your dog with you that they can get out of the car and go with you into whatever facility that you're going to be running errands at\nTo sort of have a lot of pet friendly businesses that you can take your pet him a ... one go to those businesses mhm can trigger pet or two to ...\nYeah that's the ideal thing is plan out your day ahead of time\nA lot of times we've got something going on where we need to take our dog with us say they've got an appointment somewhere whether it's agreeing appointment or a\nVeterinary appointment and then we're like well while I'm Out and about let me do X Y and Z and we kind of forget that well X Y and Z might require you to leave dog in the car in order to be able to do that\nAnd you're thinking just five ten minutes that five ten minutes is usually an underestimate of what you're actually going to be doing and again that temperature\nThinking just five ten minutes that five ten minutes is usually an underestimate of what you're actually going to be doing\nAnd again that temperature rises rather rapidly we can have a twenty degree rise in internal temperatures in the car within that ten to Fifteen minute timeframe\nAnd that in itself can start leading to some heat stress in your dog and if you're delayed in your Aaron and they're stuck in there longer than that then the body temperature will rise even more and the potential for significant internal organ damage is a lot higher\nSo again plan out your day in advance or if you have an extra person who is able to go with you let them stay in the car with the AC running\nEverybody stays cool somebody's there to watch your dog make sure that they don't do something that they're not supposed to be doing in the car because\nWe do have some dogs who has the separation anxiety or boredom and might be destructive in the car so you've got somebody there to watch them and make sure that they're behaving appropriately and to make sure that there are no signs that something's going wrong with them so if you can plan out the day accordingly or just don't take your dog with you\nKnow same thing is true with cats cats don't sweat really except for their feet either and cats don't really pants and when you see a panting cat it is a bad sign up and [noise]\nTypically the painting cat there's only a couple of reasons why they're going to be doing it the best reason they're going to be doing it as they're stressed\nAnd so it's just the stress response however the other couple of reasons why they would be panting are not good one they can't breathe very well because they're sick and their lungs aren't working properly so we've got the open mouth breathing cat which might look like a paint the other reason is because they're too hot\nAnd the two hot cat is the same problems as the dog is too hot as well we don't see a lot of heat stress and heat stroke in cats because most of them do know how to get out of the heat they're smart enough to do that and they will go and hide themselves somewhere if they're outdoor cats\nAre indoor cats obviously don't get to see the heat that often but one of the reasons that we might see that is yes you're out running errands and you forget the cats in the car\nBecause you're just busy with your schedule so again to double check and make sure that you're not forgetting anybody in the car or that your errands are allowed to bring your cat with you if necessary the other one would be of cats do something that cats like to do because they're so curious and that's jumping in the drier\nYes cats do this be careful if you're doing your laundry\nMake sure that you were there when that washer and dryer door open to make sure that nobody gets in there when you're not watching double check if you need to I've got some curious cats at home that are obsessed with a washer and dryer\nAnd yes we have to be cautious about what goes on and keep them out of there when we're doing the laundry they loved the baskets they like to get in the baskets they like to go what's in the washing machine today thankfully they rarely are too obsessed with the drier itself it's usually the washing machine\nBut thankfully it's been a really long time since we've had a cat come in who snuck itself into the drier before the owner realized it\nBut it does happen and you can imagine dryers are meant to dry clothes and it gets really hot really quickly in there so we've got the external thermal burns as well as the internal body temperature rise that goes on with that so [noise]\nUm if you see a panting cat and there's nothing that you can think of that she'd be causing them to be stressed [laughter] than they need to see their veterinarian as soon as possible [noise]\nSo let's keep them out of the car please a measure of your ... in a car oh yeah that's a really good question so if you see it\nHow does the car please uh what should you do if you find out that in a car oh yeah that's a really good question so if you see a pet\nThat was that anybody would ever do that at least that our listeners right because they all are educate other radio show listeners' views are part of the car wash or to do well\nIf you see a pet in the car and it's it's not running and there's not somebody in there watching the pet to make sure that adequate ventilation and air conditioning is going on call nine one one first let them know what you're seeing if the owner of that car and had is around alert them that this is not something you're supposed to be doing\nAnd see if they can get that pet out of the car or get the AC turned on for them\nYou're concerned about the overall wellbeing of that animal and you think that their health is an imminent danger you are now legally allowed in good faith to break that pet out of the car\nAt least in Arizona [laughter] that may not be the case in other states\nBut in good faith you can do that but it's ideal to have somebody from the police department on the phone while you're doing that so you can document the time the place and what's going on and the external temperature outside\nUh when when you saw this hadn't there if there's nobody around then you can break them out of the car there what steps have you taken to try and find the owner right [noise]\nRight but if you're worried about the imminent health of that pet and the wellbeing of that pet you do have the right in good faith to break that pet out of the car so just be aware that when that owner comes around they're not going to be happy so you definitely want to have nine one one on the line when you ah do this so\nAnd then get them out and get them in the shade if you've got water cool them down and get them to a veterinarian but again having a police officer there to help you with this process is going to be helpful so\nThis is something that you definitely want to consider doing if you see that a pet is trapped in a car because we actually we think it's a horrible way to to go so we do not want them to have to to deal with that type of heat and stress and [noise]\nThe Oregon dysfunction and everything that goes along with that so yes\nWe are at a point of course than we do need to take another quick break and when we come back we'll talk about um if you're going to go hiking with your pet some considerations that you would want to take into account before taking them out especially with this extended weekend that we're going to have so hang in there and we'll be right back after this short break\nThere's nothing as important as family edit idol rode animal hospitals your pets are treated like part of the family

free financial solution [noise] I'm Nathan Federico vice president and Mayfield financial interstate protection services incorporated an asset in retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nHave you ever been in a situation where you felt uneasy\nWhen you've placed yourself or been put in a situation that's higher risk perhaps just before you jump out of an airplane\nOr dive into shark infested waters all things I can assure you I never do sorry just not my cup of tea and I realized that some of their loved the adrenalin rush that can come from things like that but for most of us we don't like that feeling we don't like to feel vulnerable or feel an easy about something\nThat how about financial risks where you might financially feel vulnerable again there's those that like these risks and the gambles maybe they bet on sporting events or at the casino and then there's those that lead everything up to Wall Street where some of the biggest financial risks can be\nAnd the scariest part is that a lot of the time if you have an investment portfolio you don't even know what's in it so for retirement planning you want to have the right amount in your portfolio that has protected and safe\nAnd then the right amount that you can risk it's about balance\nWall Street what have you believe that they are the only place where you can find this balance\nThey threw out words like modern portfolio theory an asset diversification as ways to try to convince you that your portfolio is in fact balance the truth is that's not what having a safety first approach is all about\nTrue balance comes from having a part of your portfolio that isn't in any sort of Wall Street fund at all\nHere's the facts Wall Street is great at the risk game sure you can get big gains see huge returns when things are good but at what cost you've got to be willing to ride the ups and downs along the way\nThis is acceptable when you're still working and you're a ways off\nAnd you're still buying and re investing along the way it goes over time history does show us that it will come back it might take time but eventually it'll come back\nBut what if you're close to retirement perhaps are already retired well the stock market and Wall Street is not where you want to rely one hundred percent of your money on\nWall Street just isn't in safety business they never have and never will be that's not what they do\nDid you know that so far in two thousand Eighteen and yes we are still on the tail end of a ten year bull market run the three biggest point drops in the history of the Dow Jones industrial average have all happened in two thousand and Eighteen volatility is back in a big way\nSo as you get older you probably start to look at risk and a little bit different way than you did when you were younger risk is now no longer just a bunch of numbers\nOr what kind of volatility you can bear but it's also a risk of your livelihood or your future livelihood your lifestyle\nThe money you've saved in your four one K. or your IRA or in other savings accounts it's what you've been working on saving for your entire life\nYou don't want that to go away or have your four O. one K. turn into what they call sometimes a two oh one K. which happened right after two thousand and one when the stock market crash and in two thousand eight after the stock market crashed\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial we don't advised to our clients to rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nAnd that's where our safe money programs here at Mayfield financial really shine we want a place a portion of your portfolio into safety and remove the downside risk completely for that part of your portfolio\nThe part that you need to protect and keep safe the part that you need to be there when you want it\nAnd then you can still have that part of your portfolio that you can afford to risk and for every person there is a different amount to having safety or in our state money program and then the amount that you have at risk on Wall street\nWell for one a safe money portfolio cannot lose money to any stock market volatility that's right it can't lose money to the stock market\nSafe money also offers guaranteed growth options it has beneficiary transfer availability it can be held in an IRA or ... or even just regular saving money\nAnd if you're over fifty nine and a half and plan on still working most four O. one K. is allow you to roll over your retirement money into a safe money IRA\nThe key of having safe money is that financial security that it can bring to your retirement plan\nNow we don't normally like to compare safe money to stock market money or risk money because there are two separate things they're designed for two separate purposes and we're not trying to pit one against the other so to save money so offer growth absolutely yes it does\nWell safe money is no get rich quick schemes it does offer security and stability and growth which is exactly what you're looking for as you retire\nIf you're looking for more information on this safe money in what I'm Talking about today and you want to know more we make it easy for you we have a book here and it's called safe money it's a book that we've offered for years to our listeners right here in Tucson to get it at absolute no charge do you\nCall eight six six seven for nine seven two three three and just ask for your safe money book this one hundred and Thirteen page book contains plenty of sound retirement planning advice about how to keep your money safe\nIt talks about us treasuries and the bond market and annuities and what options are available in the financial world today to keep your money safe\nIt's an easy to read book how having financial security\nIs key to your retirement plan so again to get your book called eight six six seven for nine seven two three three or you can visit us on line at Mayfield safe money dot com or base right here in Tucson, Arizona\nNow yes don't get me wrong the stock market still is one of the most powerful tools available when it comes to growing your money there's absolutely no doubting that\nHowever that requires an ability for you to ride out the ups and downs that come with it because Wall Street is one of the absolute worst places to keep your money when you\nUsually about five years before and anytime after you retire\nYou see Wall Street isn't in the safety business they never were and they never will be when Wall Street rises and when it goes up that's what's called a bull market it's a stair step up at inches higher and higher and higher this\nCurrent bull market is now officially the longest in us history it's easy to get caught up in the excitement the games the trillion dollar market caps\nHowever just as bull markets climbed the stairs bear markets are when markets fall well they jump out the window\nHistory has shown that time and time again it's easy to see this from
