and seizures their focus will be securing the border with barricades and boots on the ground as well as setting up command centers and potentially temporary housing\nI Believe is that a smart move by

Trump and I think that that's the central conflict in the United states America what do you like I think that the actual conflict you know you've got it left me is that your dinner table at Thanksgiving who want to ruin\nThe quest to get Trump has gone so crazy that people like Jake Tapper who used to be a news reporter and uh now is sort of a tragic burned out shell of his former self\nHe's got a a TV show on a cable station called some things and ah he invited this woman I we talked about this woman Julia Ioffe\nShe's a big lefty she's been fired for you you may should she kind of made headlines a little bit I'm a little over a year ago I guess when she was fired\nAsks the Hollywood people for their lunatic idiot uninformed opinions and then naturally since they're uninformed lunatics they offered they're idiotic opinions and then the news media due to flee prints them as though we care what James Cromwell has to say about politics okay perfectly fine actor\nNow shut up and just play dress up and make believe\nAs the good lord intended vox\nIt's perfectly fine actor now shut up and just play dress up and make believe as the good lord intended\nVox has a news organization as well and again all of these things to\nTo get to today there there are many things as is often the case president was on ... in Rome last night on the Fox news channel where he had a couple of good comments on talked about the fake news media and and uh they say and I love the president tweeted out yesterday about the fake news media\nBeing the enemy of the people and it's very specifically saying the fake news media but I Do ah\nLike I said from the beginning that this whole enemy of the people thing is not language that I Would use or advised that my president or anybody's president years\nThe president continues to use that he he now has narrowed it a little bit and says it's the fake news media that is the enemy of the people\nAnd that's good and and as opposed to just the news media that's fine now the news media than people like Jim Acosta they latch onto it and they say hey wait a minute I'm the fake news media you're talking about me\nAnd they proudly wrap themselves and the cloak of the fake news media that President Trump is referring to and and they say you can't call me the enemy of the people and and you got to stop and say how dumb or you\nDo you actually read this thing and I saw even anchors on Fox News or saying well he says the news media is the enemy of the people\nAre and and it's right in front of you it's on the screen that says the fake news media that that said he could probably you know retire that particular phrase and no one would hold it against them\nVox as a news organization they say and they've got a headline today

award this was the guy that's been arrested in the past protesting outside of power plant to New York 'cause he's against energy [noise]\nAnd they refuse to pay fines ah after he was arrested so he was arrested again and and he was arrested last year for protesting at Sea World because he likes so or ... or something\nSo he's a left wing nuts and are children love to see the whales and the and then they got to go see him do stuff that's got a he's an actor this this is what happens when the drama club takes over the government from the political science on his ...\nHe says this is nation nascent fascism we always had attorney Keith totalitarian state he said\nAt his synagogue and he has struck an incredibly reasonable ... tone a remarkable a tone of uh of calm and ah he's the adults in the conversation and as a result of course he's being slaughtered he's being attacked\nBecause now he's the bad guy by the way I'm over the weekend and I noticed is I was with my best girl over the weekend it was Sunday we were driving down to congressional cemetery in in Washington DC and southeast Washington\nAnd to go visit this historic cemetery and driving down north Capitol street there were banners up for prep for\nGeorgetown Prep for a big football game it turns out it was home coming over the weekend\nAnd the New York times decide if that's the school that justice Brett Kavanaugh went two\nAnd a and the New York times noted the the homecoming and they're very excited about it back at Georgetown Prep the headline reads Kavanaugh is hailed as a hero they cause a ... they hate everything that the Democrats and the New York times well that's the Democrats\nDuring halftime at a Georgetown preparatory school's homecoming football game on Saturday a group of students swipe through photos on their phones as they waited in a long line for burgers and fries one Sandy haired boy\nSandy haired boy tapped his latest image a selfie with the justice Brett am Kevin off the newest member of the Supreme Court and an alumnus of Georgetown Prep class of Nineteen eighty three now\nWhy are they doing a story on this it's all about the hey they're still after Kevin up they really wanted to get Kevin on the New York times then they're damned us to bring down cabinet\nLight jackals going after a baby antelope they tried to peel Kavanaugh away from the herd latch onto his Achilles' heels drag 'em to the ground and then seven gym in mob form there's that n word again in my form which is ...\nThe mob form there's that n word again in my form which is what they always do justice cabinet and the New York times writes whose yours at this prestigious Catholic boys' school\nAnd I just decided to stop there for a minute when they mentioned Brock Obama going to the ... school did they did they always refer to it as the exclusive a and prestigious\nUh uh putting a host school when they talk about Al Gore going to St opens at the national cathedral isn't always the prestigious exclusive\nCaucasian St all been school little less so now perhaps but certainly when he went there said well friends where they all send their kids to you know meet and greet so they're going to have sex between the Democratic party and and the news media but I repeat myself\nAnd that's how they raise them and this story goes on for pages and pages and the New York times or about how awful it is that the Georgetown Prep people actually seek Kavanaugh as being sort of a hero in all of this because they know none of this stuff as true\nBecause they went to school with um they went to the same parties they heard about the parties they didn't go to and all the people at Georgetown ... know that all of it was a lie\nThat it was all just a horrible smear a slender all lie for political purposes to take down an enemy of the Democratic party in the end because they love abortion so much\nHow much do they love abortion\nI think more than life itself they're like all ... at this point\nThey love death more than we love life ... and this to a very large extent was about that too a very large extent and they're still calling her doctor ... and they still don't called Dr Sebastian Gorka Dr Sebastian Gorka they don't even call\nDr Ben Carson a world renowned pediatric neurosurgeon Dr Carson\nBut they called bossy Dr blond see on every reference\nBecause she's never left campus so after like fifty years on campus now you get a PHD eventually it's in nothing I think\nNot really it's in psychology or something um where she a need to spend a lot of time I think and and there's hey wait a minute there's squeak PJ is there the New York times very excited they found some of Brett Kavanaugh's old friends\nMark judge and author and filmmaker who according to Dr ...\nWitness the alleged assault was a no show oh no but that's because he minds his own business and he knows that you ... are going to be lurking around the hot dog stand like child molesters

Whitehouse Sheldon Whitehouse he's got a truck stripe suit and they got a great politician hair and he is as dumb as Mika Brzezinski\nAnd that's not easy that's pretty hard I've got to say I still of the fat shaming story how this is all Trump's fault I Love it racial slurs and fat shaming insults keep popping up on receipts as Trump worth sending the trend that's probably a Wendy's customer founder of ... with the word chubby on it\nHe's far from alone then he ordered the chubby meal\nBecause when I go to Wendy's I Love to get the ... so to double cheeseburger is an extra large fries and you get a coke and a frosty 'cause you gotta love those processes don't ya [noise]\nThere's no dairy and there but they're tasty anyway [noise] earlier this month a man named Jimmy Shoe\nJimmy shoot that then they make like five hundred dollar women's shoes ordered to sandwiches from a North Carolina Wendy's he gave a worker oh they they like they call American workers the left does\nHe gave a worker as name and plays the order about what he went to pick it up he noticed the receipt identified him as chubby rather than Jimmy his story went viral it really it went viral that hasn't that phrase been banned yet\n[noise] and when the press picked it up the press picked it up and Wendy's fired the staffer I thought he was a worker responsible for the demeaning comment\nAbout what happened a shoe isn't on common there was the Missouri man who saw big black printed on his Pizza Hut receipts\nAnd California businessman who frequent frequented landmark steakhouse in orange county\nHad no idea that the staff had repeatedly called him the N. word on receipts I'm I'm thinking that one probably didn't happened really is that what's happened to get an enlightened California repeatedly they keep calling him the N word I I'm I'm thinking that's a lawsuit in the in the making there are a try anyway\nThey also referred to him as Mick cotton wood on one sales slip now this is all Trump's fault you understand this is the point of the story I'm over the past decade so over the past decade now that's because Trump is responsible for things that predate his emergence on the political scene\nOver the past decade dozens of news stories that appeared about customers finding fat shaming comments racial slurs\nAnd anti Semitic remarks on receipts from restaurants dry cleaners another establishment printed reminders of the bias marginalized customers face wild patronizing businesses they shouldn't patronize those businesses let me just say that and then the question comes up that said\nIt's Trump's fault that's right but all of this is Trump's fault and that you don't even need to get into the details too because it's a mental illness that's just what it is\nIt's a mental illness they are crazy people I have the audio of the rabbi I have the ah from yesterday which got him in trouble with the left and then today talking about how the left is threatening him and calling them all kinds of slurs and things\nBut uh I I Know this is how you get uninvited from coming back on CNN too so I don't think we're going to see a lot more of the rabbi on CNN means that

Trump or infuriates them with everything he does with every breath he takes with every move he makes\nTo paraphrase staying and we also have an update on the situation in Pittsburgh the president and

striking a very reasonable tone which is not acceptable to today's\nDemocratic Party so he is of course since been attacked and smeared and slime didn't called terrible things because he's Jewish and threatened and all the usual stuff that we see and I will I'll get into that as well\nUm [laughter] Senator Bill Nelson a Democrat from Florida as compared to the\nCurrent political climate in the

that CNN and MSNBC put out I marvel at the fact that President Trump and I hate to even say this out loud that President Trump isn't shot at every day by some\nLeft it there was one and we don't know how many death threats have been lodged against President Trump but I'm sure the number is extraordinary\nRemember how they tried to claim that Obama got more death threats because he's black and then the head of the secret service came out and said no that's not the case under oath on Capitol Hill and the news media in the Democrats just kept repeating it anyway\nBecause they don't care that that's sort of their bag baby [noise] now I'm guessing that President Trump you remember there was one English illegal alien\nThat tried to assassinate candidate Trump in Las Vegas Nevada\n[noise] ah and I'm not ... and that reminds me of a thing you know President Trump on Saturday he went to a political rally and a Wisconsin Wisconsin\nAnd a and the news media is very upset because there had been this terrible event that day\nAnd today CNN they single out something he told a joke when he was like after an hour on stage or something he was up there for an hour he told a joke\nAnd a and CNN was very upset with him for telling a joke I remember when I'm ... and ... when the sun came up Brock Obama got on air force one and flew to Las Vegas Nevada for fundraising event where he told jokes and you're up with everybody\nAnd the news media doesn't have a a peep not a peep out of them not a thing to say about any of that nothing\nBecause we're not for double standards liberals would have
