but don't you go to prison for that should end up in a penitentiary before all this has over good morning and welcome\nDay he had another bucket full of lunacy from that I you know the the the news media the Democrats really don't have to do anything at this point their dog whistle has been hurt by the news media you know liberals love to talk about dog whistles they think everybody communicate and\nAnd so has been hurt by the news media you know liberals love to talk about dog whistles they think everybody communicates and dog whistles are codes or something like that\nConservatives never do communicate in code or a dog whistle we actually just tell you what we're thinking because we're honest and not duplicitous and slippery slimy and we don't hang out with creepy porn more and we don't make stuff up about gang rape and and\nUh you know we really don't do that sort of stuff the Democrats do a lot of that but we don't really do a lot of that and I'm marveling that what I saw last night on the television\nAnd on Al Gore's amazing Internet because NBC News you know they interviewed\nJulie a sweat and uh the whole creepy porn lawyer affidavit thing the wheels came flying off it was like it was like the chase in bullet you know where the the charge or lost five hub caps and stuff it's there are things just flying all over the place yesterday in the Democrat story\nAnd uh there are no holes in this Julie sweating the story that\nMohammed I'll talk and fly planes through that has to say that they're very large holes in her story\nMy friends and I are kind of doing jokes all over the place now texting back and forth on your text something and the\nAnd then your text back well looks like you'll never served on the Supreme Court I was with my friend ... last week on a rooftop place and and uh we're having beers and or should we get one more ago and I said I don't know you have one more you'll never served on the Supreme Court [laughter]\nDoes become like a running joke now that that everything is everything you do everything you say everything you type a every beer you have is a threat to your future on the Supreme Court it's it's a joke you're you're you're right this is a joke this whole process as a joke it's a sham\nAnd and you and the media was hysterical about this gang raped gang rape\nWhat are the most horrific crimes it's a war crime they're accusing him of crimes against humanity of war crimes and what what would be in another context and then you interviewed a woman and she's got a completely different story and and the news media is they just shrug\nOh and also a a sweat ... sweating that she [laughter]\nSee here what do you think they called her in high school and uh\nThe or the other but she says she told NBC News that she has four witnesses four witnesses to Brett Kavanaugh handing out red solo cups at a party three and a half decades ago she was of the age of majority she was contributing to the delinquency of miners in this situation by the way\nAnd ah NBC News doing their due diligence because they heard the dog whistles from the Democratic party and their lap dogs for the Democratic party and so they contacted they tried to contact all for people that sweating at a a suggested that NBC News contacts two of them are just didn't get back to NBC\nOne of them is that debt I buried and uh the fourth one said I've never heard of ... they're going to I don't know who this person is so that's the kind of cooperation you get from the Democrat side on this they they they're doing a great job a heck of a job a creepy porn wire heck\nOf a job you ever look at your credit card statement and been appalled by the interest rate didn't you know that you can actually roll your credit card debt into one monthly payment at a lower fixed rate huh the average credit card raiders and Jimmy Carter land that's over Eighteen percent\nBut my friends that light stream offered credit card consolidation loans from five point eight nine percent a PR with auto pay and you can get your funds as soon as today\nLike trained believes that people with good credit deserve great interest rates and no fees and light streamed

the women at a party three and a half decades ago which is different if I'm not mistaken\nUnder the law and in other contexts as well but that doesn't matter because now it's about his temperament ... news the news media has moved the goalposts for the Democrats and now\nDoesn't matter because now it's about his temperament ... news the news media has moved the goalposts for the Democrats and now
