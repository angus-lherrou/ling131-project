hour during two sons morning news right here on one of ... Ga [noise]\n\nBut they say why\nThere's all kinds of me I'm going on in America today [noise] however\nVictoria just walked in with a wonderful story\nBut the secret service put out a statement I'm minutes ago late on October twenty third two thousand Eighteen that's yesterday [noise] the secret service recovered a single package\nAddress to the former first lady Hillary Clinton noticed the secret service doesn't call her the former secretary of state you know why\nBecause she gets her Secret Service protection predicated on her status as former first lady Secret Service doesn't protect secretaries of state or former secretaries of state diplomatic security does that's a different organization altogether\nSo they describe her as the former first lady Hillary Clinton in in Westchester County New York rich people mansions you know ... Indian name that cultural appropriation by the way\nEarly this morning October twenty four two thousand Eighteen a second package address to former president Barack Obama was intercepted by Secret Service personnel in Washington DC\nThe packages were immediately identified during routine male screening procedures see there it is as potential explosive devices and we're appropriately handled as such\nThe protests tease that has Obama and Clinton did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them\nThe secret service has initiated a full scope of criminal investigation that will leverage all available federal state and local resources to determine the source of the packages and identify those responsible\nNow that's the role that the secret service has in this\nUm and protecting protect tease as they're called\nThe secret service would also be putting out a statement if one was in fact perceived at the remote mail facility for the White House they would be a responsible likely for putting out a statement on that as well\nUm the White House ah put out a statement also president Donald Trump has been briefed on the packages White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement condemning they attempted violent acts\nShe said we condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama\n... President Clinton Secretary Clinton and other public figure say that they've got a phrase that a little differently they're talking about Bill Clinton of course because Hillary is never going to be president and she's not now which is really great news for humanity\nThese terrorizing acts are despicable and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law just like people crossing our border right and breaking all the various laws there\nThe United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards\nSanders said\nSo ah we've got that and now again adding to that CNN the secret service has not responsible for CNN but they may want to look at the packages to see if they're the same check the characteristics say if you're dealing with a single person look for a a you know the usual evidence sort of you all watch CSI or something right [noise]\nSo we've got that ... suspicious packages flying all over the place it's like a party at Harvey Weinstein's house All right let's let's go to um we have fought him on the subject of the care of him and we have callers on the subject of the character who's behind the caravan\nTo go to um we have caught him on the subject of the care of him and we have callers on the subject of the character who's behind the caravan this is a great when the news media says nobody nobody's behind the caravan\nExcept there are a big problems with that story now\nThere are lots of people behind the caravan they're all leftists and we have Mike Pence we have Mike Pence on this let's go to a at some point number six I think is the first Mike Pence on this\nVice president Mike Pence at the White House yesterday in the oval office with the president of the United states taking lots and lots of questions from miscreants like Jim Acosta of the cable Nazi network and that's what the un stance whereas\nUh and and uh and he said well he spoke to vice president Pence spoke to president Hernandez of ah Honduras and asked them hey what's going on with this whole a caravan thing where did it come from\nDifferent direction is president Hernandez of Honduras told me that the care of and the snow making its way through Mexico headed for the southern border was organized by let this organizations and financed by Venezuelan\nWell organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela because they're left it there you know their county types down there and this is what they do they mess with the United states and with freedom loving people and they still all your stuff\nAnd uh and again I mentioned there is a story today the suicide rate in Venezuela sky rocketing and one town where they did the story they are doctors and the hospital overwhelmed and fatigue and psychologically tortured by all of the suicide cases they're dealing with\nBecause Bernie Sanders plans have been implemented there\nAnd now everyone wants to die or they're fleeing\nA vice president Pence number a number of seven hey what but the president said they're terrorists in their\nVice president Pence and he didn't actually say there are terrorists in there I I don't think but that there could likely be given might know criminals and the care of him not not all the murderers in Honduras\nHighest murder rate in the world for any country\nThey're all staying behind because they know because the CNN says there no criminal ... so we can't go because CNN said there are no criminals\nMS Thirteen said we can't go 'cause MSNBC said there are no criminals they they all said well ... is that there are no ... ... so there are no drug traffickers are human traffickers so they all stay at home that's that's how they got him to say vice president Pence\nThe United states of America intervenes and prevents ten terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable\nThat there would not be individuals or from the middle east as a part of this growing the care of with the president's determined to do is put the safety and security of the American people first\nWell that's the news media doesn't do that and the Democrats don't do that [noise]\nUh and and he's not saying in the Caribbean but I think people just trying to sneak into the country people coming in illegally\nUm terrorist suspects ten a day that's an average\nOver the course of the year it's three sixty five times ten what does that now thirty six fifty and uh and uh that many suspected terrorists every day so it's inconceivable it's just that I I don't think that we're means what you think it means\nIt's inconceivable that are in a crowd of ... whatever the number is now ten thousand twelve thousand that there wouldn't be criminals that there wasn't that there wouldn't be ... and uh so on\nAnd by the way the organizer for a an organization\nSo there wasn't that there wouldn't be ... and a son and by the way the organizer for a an organization called Web below scene from us\nWhich is a people Without Borders says this is like liberal celebrities or are they think they can just move into your house and and push you off the couch and and the Democrats are supporting that they're good\nAt like ... men sing an organizer he's a community organizer for what blows scene from the routes and immigration rights group that organized a similar smaller caravan an April\nTold USA Today it's a mass exodus well we're trying to stop the mass exodus book published in frontier is is an organizing for some hardcore left wing ers who want to dismantle the United states of America that's the short version but it's true in the final analysis\nAnd then put little scene frontiers I went to their website this morning to see what they are all about they're raising money for the Palestinians Hi this is a hardcore left wing organization\nFurther more there is a Honduran politician who is that the epicenter of this whose name is mark total of ... a former Honduran opposition lawmaker long time migrant advocate as the caravans ringleader he is the ringleader\nNow he tweeted up I'm One of those things started hey we're gathering up a caravan to go to the United states and then he got some friends in the local news media down there to say a caravan as gathering\nIt started on October twelve with about a hundred and twenty migrants gathered in San Pedro Sula Honduras near the Guatemalan border and uh then they started gaming gaining steam and ... says told the television station in Honduras you and he unique\nUh that uh they're going and that's what started so he's a hardcore left wing I got an and vice president Pence talk to the president of Honduras and a Hernandez and he says that the president Honduras told him that Venezuela was financing this\nAnd was behind it so we've got that going for us\nAll right let's go to let's go to the telephones so areas in the news media is telling you it's just the U.S they just they they can't stop light they everything they're saying is is a untrue to varying degrees shades of gray let's go to a Rick in Fairfax, Virginia Rick you're on the crust plant show\nYeah Hi when my wife is from Honduras and they are legally if you work for a fortune five hundred company has paid at all that good stuff but I Want to say um you know part of the reason you know people they say well why don't the people in Honduras and everything you know fight\nBack but you know they've been Sophie down by socialism\nThat they they can't they don't have guns they don't have weapon it's only eight million people spread over a pretty good sized country they can't band together and do that and and Honduras has a pretty good uh military and they'd all be killed if they tried anything and it wouldn't go anywhere", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city":
