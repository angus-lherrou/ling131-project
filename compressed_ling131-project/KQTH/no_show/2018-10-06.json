building retirement income is so important to your financial help\nEspecially as you are near or already in retirement\nAt Mayfield financial NSA protection services for over twenty five years we have specialized in creating safe income strategies for our clients we oversee more than one hundred million dollars in safe money client funds right here in ...\nThat enjoy our retirement income planning strategies\nSo what do we do and why to our clients love us it's pretty simple we are safe money advisors and for that certain part of your portfolio we do not recommend or use any strategies are investments that have a potential to lose money from stock market risk\nWe have never had to have a conversation with any of our clients about why they lost money due to stock market performance\nNo of course we're more than just one trick pony is over here and Mayfield financial over the years we have assembled an entire team a financial specialists that can take care of everything you need in the financial world in retirement\nBut here at Mayfield financial we believe and know that getting this first part of your retirement plan the safe money income part is so crucial so we focus entirely on that\nAs safe money specialists in the financial world we can help you turn that part of your retirement portfolio into what it needs to be in retirement and that is income income that last one that grows and is protected\nAnd now it doesn't have to be income that starts right now some of the best planning takes place about five years before you need to start to use your nest egg in retirement before you start to need to get that income\nSome call it the retirement danger zone and that's about five years before and after you retire\nThat's the time where it's most important to look for and speak with a retirement income specialists one that can create a guaranteed income stream and protect your retirement from stock market losses\nIt's about building a foundation of income from that part of your portfolio to create the income for that you are going to want to have in retirement one that will take care of your essentials to cover your needs to take care of those basic expenses\nWhen you do that you unlock inability to truly have a worry free retirement\nSo to learn more for yourself on a sabotaging a foundation of income and about working with a retirement income specialists and to learn a little bit more about Mayfield financial\nInto income and in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you were a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan\nAnd it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of them and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement especially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives\nThis is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four O. one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case and IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee it income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four oh one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash\nOver thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire this couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey failed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety a principal and guarantees\nThis is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan and we've been doing it here for over twenty five years\nAnd we believe and know that for at least a part of your portfolio your four O. one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever to lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and the head of inflation\nAre safe money plants do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four O. one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course raw IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive\nAll with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no commissions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late\nTake action
