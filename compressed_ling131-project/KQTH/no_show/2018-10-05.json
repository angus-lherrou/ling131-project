I. R. G. is Aaron Cain Aaron good morning thanks for joining us I guess a today is energy efficiency day\nYes it is on next for having me make on energy better I had no energy efficiency uh how are you approaching this\nYeah um so there is in many ways that people are celebrating national energy efficiency day um we I ... and I've heard on education find are actually calling on the air is in a corporation commission\nTo restore funding for energy efficiency programs mhm um because energy efficiency is the quickest cheap is an cleanest resource to me Arizona's growing energy needs\nAs government embrace to energy efficiency as a priority\nSo I'm In the past have had these programs funded I'm actually since two thousand ten on every dollar I'm invested in energy efficiency um has returned about four dollars and benefits are eight pairs I'm so these programs have already been funded we estimate that the funding restored increased\nMhm so how do you get ... imagine that'll happen just like republic support people speak up\nYeah um so we have a lot of public support behind us already but we're looking to get even more obviously to show the corporation commission that they should put this on their agenda because it is something that saves the repair money I'm as well as saves energy\nThe constitution to require that uh we moved to a certain percentage of renewable energy overtime or what's your position on that\nOn airs and ... find is not taking a position on one place I've been um we're focusing primarily on energy efficiency which is different than a renewable energy okay\nAll right well a lot of people are kind of confusing the two and a lot of it has to do with the fact that we go out and we feel is intense so we're just wrapping up summer\nOr everyone is aware of the enormous amount of energy the sun provides and or the or the ability for a a you average consumer out there to save some money by using solar energy or how do you approach that\nYeah I'm so energy efficiency um itself on these people money because it requires us to use less energy so energy efficiency are things like\nWhether whether it's whether I is windows no windows that don't allow Calera to escape said and we don't have to use our AC Islam or or things like energy efficient appliances said that they're more efficient and we don't have to run them as high on the electric grid I'm so these are really good way especially in the summer um to save money on our electric bills\nAnd so you're making a distinction between energy sources and actually how we conduct our lives are with regard to the energy that we use and this includes every you know you look at some of the\nOver the course of the eighties nineties got a big building boom in Arizona and all these sticking stucco houses went up and uh they tried to suggest that they had some energy efficiency to them when they didn't\nUh and then you look at the you know some of these a community that we do have in Arizona or have have zero energy is um how far away are we from the ladder\nUm I'm not sure exactly on the numbers and that but you know the technology has been improving on people are more conscious of energy use so we definitely have the ability to be more energy efficient and we just need these programs in place so that people can take advantage of them and make their hands more efficient and\nAnd what are they can what folks expect from Arizona per a with regard to help in this area\nYeah so we like I said are calling on this mission to put it on the agenda uh we're getting on business owners constituents across the state and to show their support\nThrough a writing letters to the corporation commission um we're doing a lot of social media around that um things like that and so once it's on the agenda we can move forward on even further to get this actually voted and approved\nAnd All right today is energy efficiency day as being reminded that by airing came this morning by Arizona burg thank you Aaron how great weekend\nYeah they can make ... ... is a seven twenty seven\nTo sun traffic on one of our wind take UPA nothing crazy out there on the Tucson streets where our friday morning commute traffic bubbles remain pretty steady Brant wrote nice fun once you get off by ten you will find some delayed there as well as traffic around new of vague gulp links westbound getting this\nOne that may take an extra light to get through there a whole east bound getting to mission road backs up past ... construction or crash that I missed seven to one to two seven seven seven to one cars ...

consistent a consistency can really help to break down some of those walls that they've built up and so that they can learn to read trust and hopefully reintegrate but there can be some built in

go by one of the things that I'm hoping is that when all of this is over that uh and and it's not gonna be impossible dream I think I'm building windmills but that when all of this is over\nThat we will be allowed to return as a country to the western norms that had been in place and our civilization for eight centuries or so uh where you are innocent until proven guilty\nBy a court of law and a jury of your peers\n... presumption ... innocence ... should be restored to our legal system into our political process and our media\nIs orderly and capable of shame of course but if they were capable they they should be horribly ashamed of themselves for their performance and they're not even going to pull it across the finish line for the Democrats\nAnd I may be assuming just a little bit here\nTravel across the country to stand in front of government buildings for the media and a look like idiots and they've got more than their share\nThere are some Seventy year old white guy with a grey beard standing behind the guy with the economy T shirt\nAnd he's got a T shirt on and says stand with black women or is a Seventy something year old white guy with a grey beard and he's got to stand with black women seized cut race and gender in there is a this racist and trying\nTo make it very ... you know that how do you get race into this debate well just ask a liberal then we can go to ... powers from this morning who's a Democrat she's actually from Alaska\nA cure cure certain powers\nAnd she she seems a little trouble these days I've got to say she seems stressed out of the point where the shoes troubled and I got to do this you know the uh confirming Brett Kavanaugh is going to break the spirits of\nSo many on the left and so many in the Democratic party and I and you know why don't you because they don't believe in getting laws passed through the legislature they believe in suing and putting everything in the courts and they believe in stacking the Supreme Court\nTo their advantage in their favor now that you know getting Hillary Hillary was going to do that she was going to put most said tongue on the on the Supreme Court and forever after we would be dismantling the constitution of the United states of America but we have been looking to save\nAnd the Supreme Court and forever after we would be dismantling the constitution of the United states America\nBut we have been looking to save the constitution and deny the left the Supreme Court and all we ask of our justices once they're seated is that they protect and defend the constitution of the United states America respect the laws of the United states America not legislate from the bench that's all we ask them the\nDemocrats' demand that they legislate from the bench this is of course while the Supreme Court is so important to them it's the ultimate prize for them not the president said because that comes and goes but the Supreme Court much more long lasting effects\nAnd because they choose not to look at Brock Obama how we avoided putting things through the the Congress through the legislature and instead that everything by executive order by executive ... through the departments and the agencies and a while his allies out here and crazy land\nOr filing lawsuits all over the place that they they spend their lives and their careers just filing lawsuits and following them up through the court system and getting the Supreme Court and and if they ... the Supreme Court than uh than it's when when you know winter winter chicken dinner for them ding ding ding all over the place and that's why they're so upset about being denied\nThis fifth seat time the Supreme Court the swing vote on the Supreme Court and then Ruth Bader Ginsburg I Know is going to retire\nVery very soon I'm just I'm just a good friend on the Democrats here but she I think she's going to have to return she might have to retire and I think we should ever impeached I think we should start an impeachment movement against Ruth Bader Ginsburg who must step down\nAs a Supreme Court justice because there have been accusations of impropriety illegality even on her part now there's going to have to be an investigation and in the meantime she's going to have to step down from the court for the good of the court\nAnd the country [noise]\nMutt cures certain powers this morning um they've got this guy out here stand with black women wear any black women accusers now they just like to inject race and everything\nAnd they they like to polarize everything it's identity politics it's a year in this bucket and I'm In that bucket and we all have to fight with each other uh the genders have to be at each other's throats all fifty eight of them apparently\nAnd I'm we've got one gender and the Democrats a I'm a you know have a sixteen for mailed us then we have women and they've got another forty eight for that\nThey literally have on Facebook fifty eight genders fifty or genders that you can choose from\nThis happened because of ... and and the left but there and say here's didn't powers are very very for Lauren about all of this and she's pressuring Earl pressuring Senator Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Republican to vote against there's a lot of pressure lot of pressure\nThe Democrats yesterday flew in a team of\nAbsolute women from Alaska Eskimo women if you will from Alaska and uh they are shamed Senator Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Republican into coming at a meeting with these native women from Alaska that were flown in by the Democrats and they're not afraid of flying\nAnd they're here to pressure\nLisa Murkowski to ... to do with her and took place or just like a a a Bette Midler said to to end slavery and to beat her and pull her and um and into voting with the Democrats and she may or may not\nJoe mansion on the other hand from West Virginia Democrat may vote in favor of Brett cabinet and the card count as looking very good for the Republicans very good Mike Pence may have to come in and break the tie up the Republicans can only get fifty Republicans only have fifty one votes\nBoat they could lose one that can lose Lisa Murkowski as long as they hold on to Jeff Flake and Susan Collins silk puts them at fifty then the vice president who's the president of the Senate can come in and be the deciding vote that gives it fifty one\nAnd then the Democrats pulled the detonation cards on their suicide vests inside the Senate chamber and their splattered all over the ceiling and it's a and we can all laugh and clap from home and it'll be a real funny and all that stuff steers empowers\nTalking about this feels very strongly and and I I just it's amazing how they can racialized anything the Democrats are the biggest racists in our country certainly outside our country racism has a lot worse\nContrary to what the Democrats would tell you are but here it is how do you racialized a story that's about an all white people\nI totally understand somebody mean up that I think we had all gone back and watch ... ... a response or in a similar situation and he uh was clearly a fat but he didn't act the way\nBack cabinet dad and I think that a lot of people look at that professionally women and people of color and pay if that hadn't been a white man doing that I think that people would have a very different reaction to it\nYeah that's a while but it was a white man so ah [laughter] and we can go back and look at Clarence Thomas had see he behaved as he should have and and she's saying well we Democrats were going to call your child rapists and gang rape posts and serial rapists and\nSay that you're drug teenage girls and gang raped them uh and you shouldn't lose your cool otherwise you know that's a\nI I look for they're going to be a lot of payback for this from me at dinner tables and things in casual conversation with Democrats and with liberals there's going to be a lot of pay back for years over this\nFor years over the gang rape quail lewd ... years going on for two years a young Fifteen year old Brett Kavanaugh with his ... club striped tie was apparently slipping quite loads to teenage girls in gang raping them\nAt parties dozens of parties over the course of years it's been years and that was his Fifteen year old self and still he was valedictorian or whatever of as a class now them as they racial I said well\nYou know Clarence Thomas really that's the way we want them to behave that's why we expected him to bed we didn't expect him to hit back well we're hitting back\nAll right so you sit down and shut up about that with just to start with that you know on the sea cruise\nWe have an annual sea cruise the ... we called the crust plant secrets and nice people come along and there was a a nice couple very nice couple I was talking to and I won't use any names the nice lady\nNice lady said are said to me you know Chris Shays said um why why Trump and why voted for Trump and why voted for Trump and and I said why and she said very pointedly because I was tired of being told to shut up\nAnd I think there are many millions of us that feel precisely like that I I think she articulated\nVery eloquently what millions of us are feeling and this whole exercise was an effort by the Democrats to shut everyone up\nBy bringing in gang rape and quaint moods and attempted rape and one piece bathing suits and Nineteen eighty two or whatever you're it might have been and sleazy lawyers with spiky her cuts and\nCreepy lawyers with beards and Michael ... the creepy porn lawyer and and and these women making outrageous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike crazy and take and how many strings and arrows twenty four seven so it is I turned to stand up and vote\nSupport the people who fought\nBack and we need to fight for them and show the Democrat what democracy looks\nLike you I thought it was beautiful that was just perfect boy\nThat was great when you're a hundred ... you know that is not what democracy looks like raised raised on very shy even people who smell badly yelling at the top of their lungs in harassing people that's that's not actually what it looks like\nA lot

Kevin our family a brick Kevin had to come in and fight for his life you know the Democrats were not planning on just taking the Supreme Court seat from\nThey were planning on having him removed from the lower court based on their smear and so he was going to be out of a job and unemployable and unable to make mortgage payments and as children would never look at him a admiring Lee again because the Democrats decided to do a job on him and um\nI Hope that after the dust settles and the smoke clears that the majority of Americans are going to be able to see clearly what we witnessed here in retrospect I Hope that we'll be able to see very clearly what this episode was all about\nIt was a horrible reprehensible stain on American history\nIt was the Democratic party being as despicable and reprehensible as they've ever been well maybe not as they've ever been because they'd been pretty despicable as a party in the past slavery and Jim Crow in the Klan and standing in school how stores and\nYou know that sort of stuff and turning the Japanese during World War two they've got a lot of stains on their history this is just another staying on the blue dress that is the Democratic\nParty [noise] it's an episode of historic corruption\nAnd I hope that people will be able to see this afterward and be able to sort of shake our heads like ... the at the end of the wizard of Oz and say all of us all just a terrible dream\nOr like Dan Ackroyd and trading places wiping waking up and saying it was all just a terrible dream it's\nYou know maybe that's a better analogy I'm not sure although

away\nI asked uh what are the lessons learned here and somebody called in was hanging on the line I don't think he's on any more than what I've learned is that I better not ever run for office [laughter] and that's a fact jak with so many of us\nNow it looks like and it's all the leaves and all this stuff but just as we were getting off the air yesterday morning twenty some odd hours ago\nUm we learned that senator Collins the Republican I'm moderate middle of the road Republican from Maine a lot of pressure to vote against\nHad reviewed the FBI documents said she found that documents the FBI review it to be thorough\nI'm senator Collins and um and Fox News is now reporting that senator Collins is a yes and and that is good news now is that on this procedural vote or on the uh the final final I think it's on the final final\nAnd that's very important because you know the balance in the Senate is fifty one Republicans on forty nine Democrats\nOne of them is Bernie Sanders he's a communist he calls himself an independent he's really a Democrat what's the difference Susan Collins apparently now a yes according to Fox News and then we have Jeff Flake the aptly named Jeff Flake who caused the ah the delay and um I gotta tell ya if Jeff Flake\nVotes against if he ends up being the deciding vote bringing down the Kavanaugh nomination\nOr he'd better learn to speak Spanish because uh this is going to be no country for him\nAfter that I Believe that Jeff Flake would vote yes that effectively wins the day because that would put them at fifty and then if\nFor some reason Lisa Murkowski the wishy washy Republican from Alaska who's being pressured by ...\nIf she votes no\nOh the the wishy washy Republican from Alaska who's being pressured by ... or if she votes no than they still have fifty votes theoretically and\nUm then the vice president Mike Pence can come in and bring up the fifty one and when the day it's also possible that the Democrat from West Virginia Joe mansion who is not completely irrational like most Democrats these days may come in and also West Virginia President Trump won by thirty some points\nIn the presidential election so it's kind of approach trumped state and it might be good for his political ah longevity of the vote in favor of President Trump in West Virginia Joe Manchin may come over a which would alleviate the need for Mike Pence to come in and break the tie and also that would be really good because it would make it a bipartisan vote\nIt would make it a bipartisan trucks and Lisa Murkowski you should vote in favor of a judge Kavanaugh she should she may not do should\nTheir flogging her they're whipping her they're bringing in absolute women to drew a stroke sing at her or something they're shouting at
