think this is going to do anything except grow there's going to be increased accountability and pressure on legislators\nJoe Thomas's Arizona Education Association president and one of the most vocal organizers of red thread which saw teachers walk out of classrooms and march on the state capital until a state budget passed designed to give teachers or raise\nBut in an effort to get more funding for Arizona schools read for at morphed into invest in it but that tax proposal kicked off the ballot is the state Supreme Court ruled it contained confusing language\nThere have been a lot of challenges along the way and remember this is ten years ten years of waiting for the legislature to act\nDespite the hurdles Thomas tells me the focus now is on supporting candidates for the state legislature that they deem are pro education including some teachers now running for office\nWe're looking at the Senate We're looking at the house we need to pick up a chamber are looking at the governor and and that still can happen there's a lot of issues out there while Thomas\nHopes red threads candidates a choice with big next Tuesday he says the movement moves forward no matter what but he can't take another walk out completely off the table and an effort to improve Arizona school\nWe wish we could do that in the election which is what we're trying to do we want to do that through the traditional means but if the only way the legislature and governor will listen to us is if we step out of our classrooms temporarily so we can come back permanently with more permanent funding that I think educators are ready to take that risk\nThat was if you expect him to say anything else Joe Thomas tells me he is confident election day will do well for red for ad but if it doesn't he tells me the movement well and but it would adjust so a lot of what rent for as looks like it's a movement in the long term really depends on what happens next Tuesday\nYet the eye's been told of a

played the audio yesterday the president did an interview with um I keep saying it's vox but it's the other one it's a\n...\nAnd a a reporter guy asked President Trump question\nAbout birthright citizenship penned the fourteenth amendment perhaps you've heard of it\nAnd ah the president gave an answer that surprised everyone it surprised the world it shocked the world\nAnd now the news media boy they got their pennies and a wedge they got they got something stuck and uh they're really upset who knew who knew that the news media was so in love with the fourteenth amendment this is an extraordinary thing they hadn't mentioned anything about the fourteenth amendment and years and years and then\nPresident Trump mentioned that he's in favor of an executive order and you know executive order ... says to modify the fourteenth amendment to the constitution and a and a lot of people say oh you can't do that that's the constitution\nThat seven oh one on one of the amendments and it comes to you have to go through the process of amending the constitution\nNow now wait a minute you're saying that that uh people from the Dominican Republic and and probably from Haiti and

about this\nA few years ago and I'm Wondering if they're going to\nRehash it again or not or if it's going to be buried because it's a big\nBig problem specifically and I wish that President Trump weighed chronologically and analytically exposed birth tourism and how much it costs us taxpayer\nYearly because if he can is able to do this and the next couple of days it could really impact the election on Tuesday\nYeah no I think you're right and a look at the president cannot throw it out there are other good came out of the blue I think the president was asked the question he wasn't planning on saying anything about it he said what he said he got the ball rolling now it's now it's an issue look the NBC News if that'd be no NBC News is not going to do the same story they did when Obama was president\nPresident Trump said this yesterday so\nThe news media is dead set against any change to the fourteenth amendment any any look at the fourteenth amendment it's like\nYou know they're special guitar and spinal tap don't even look at this guitar you you are you're not allowed to talk about the fourteenth amendment\nYou know the left Sylvie loves to say oh it's the browning

country forget you're such racist but\nForget about your racism from moments you're just hostile to our country and whatever you think is that the Democrats and the left whatever's detrimental to their country our country they're in favor of and and now that the president has said something about the fourteenth amendment they are hell bent on keeping the fourteenth amendment just as it is\nAnd and and that's it so now the battle lines have been drawn and President Trump\nDidn't really I mean it is through this thing out there on the news media instead of saying well let's talk about that what is the language said they just immediately went went crazy they went berserk\nAttacking the president in support of the fourteenth amendment which I promise you day before yesterday Alison ...

Virginia Andre you're on the crust plant Cher\nHi good morning is happy Halloween why thank you Andre\n... listen I based on the election discussion and we've been having the last few days it'll touch on a nationalism in the ... but I Want to make a prediction that the Republicans will hold the house or your wife and I I kind of made it work production which fought back and twenty sixteen what it boils down to for me is what's called the Bradley effect\nAnd that is the disparity between polling and actual voting and it's named after the may oh ray\nThat that's an embodiment of nationalism and if you think about so I left trying to defend the fourteenth amendment suddenly you know there there are ... basically their argument in a very strong nationalistic footprint ... and even like you think about the British in their Brexit vote that's a very strong national\nYeah you've got to do that you about and\nSo anyway just some type of theory that you know I listen to your show almost daily and I I Love it and I just want to get my two cents those themes in theory about voting oh here's one thing we do know is that Democrats are typically more extreme thick minded whereas Republicans are more intrinsic and that's why you see a lot more bumper stickers\nOn Democrats cars are there need to conform or be part of a larger group there their identity comes from relating to a larger group\nAnd uh so conformity typically happens when a society puts out issues that are hard to understand or a detailed enough that you know the average person they can't get there are a threat it so they look for others to give them a password and understanding\nThat's right and a hundred percent right about it and and they also deliberately make simple issues very complicated because they know that people will eventually glaze over and then they'll just take the bumper sticker explanation\nThey'll just go to the bumper sticker approach exactly you know and I think we can see that phenomena anywhere you go I mean not up on bumper stickers are typically you did this for a living huh I you know I Do and I have and I've done some scholarship\nOn the issue a ... on these issues and it's just I'm retired now you know we thought well I'm I'm a retired military journalist honor to years\nYeah you're right I think you're right on the money I think everything you say is is a thoughtful and a serious and intelligent and I think you're\nI think you're a hundred percent right and and you know why are the polls wrong well there is this could have the sort of a variation on the Bradley effect it might even be the Trump effect after a few years to update the old a Bradley effect but but I think you're absolutely right and why were the polls\nSo far off and election day in two thousand six team that was our last election seems like longer ago than Twenty one months or whatever it is\nA ... and I'm I'm twenty four months now for the elections anyway the president's been in for Twenty one months but I think you're I think you're absolutely right and and you believe that ... that the polls are going to be wrong enough that the Republicans hold the house\nI I think so and especially with this new fourteenth amendment debate I think on its face I think most people know and understand\nThat birthright citizenship outside of the uh how it was written or the intended yours is wrong and there's nothing that Democrats can say to make it right they know what's wrong if you look at a bell curve of it is you know it's only been kind of a thing in the sixties yeah so it fits into the narrative that the Democrats are really driving for voters\nYeah and that's exactly right or wrong yeah you're you're a hundred percent ... you're you're very wise men Andrea and I know that you're wise because I agree with you on everything [laughter] and that's what that's how you can tell if a person is really smart is they say all the things that you believe you want to hear you agree with a person with a really great sense of humor is a person that last year jokes\n[laughter] and so that works those are ... there are a come into the ... I Love it Andre thank you thanks very much shit right call\n'em yeah great self and listen my uh my Palin a seat in ... getting famous I heard ... motley mentioned on national radio yesterday\nMy friend ... who lives here in the area and follows these things and writes in his or on a variety of issues very smart guy and he points out that the author of the fourteenth amendment was a a Michigan senator by the name of Jacob Howard and Jacob Howard the author of the amount of\nUh said unless the here's what he said he said every person born with\nAnd Jacob Howard the author of the amendment or said unless there is what he said he said every person born within the limits of the u._s. and subject to their jurisdiction\nHe continued this will not of course include persons born in the U.S who are foreigners comma aliens come up who belong to the families of ambassadors\nAll right so you're a foreign on voyeur the ambassador from France or from the court of St James and Britain you're living in the United states uh you your your family or has children\nThe families of ambassadors having children here they're here in an official capacity certainly legally and the frame or the writer the author of the fourteenth amendment said that it would not apply said quite explicitly not in the amendment but in writings\nThat we're a tandem writings that went along with the creation of the fourteenth amendment\nSo if you're if you're an ambassador and your wife assuming the ambassador when this was written as a man and the ambassador's wife gives birth that the ambassador's child is now the U.S is not a U.S citizen\nThe fourteenth amendment the language and the and he says also very explicitly and this is what the court the Supreme Court would have to consider this is what the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will ignore and then the Supreme Court will take into account appropriately and and then waited appropriately\nAnd I don't want him to come up with my favorite solution I mean I sort of do but only if the constitution only if it's the correct interpretation and what the court to come to the correct legal interpretation\nKeeping in mind that countries all over the world that used to have birthright citizenship have done away with Bert birthright citizenship there's not a country in Western Europe or in Eastern Europe that has birthright citizenship\nMany used to have birthright citizenship but at the last country to get rid of ... birthright citizenship was Ireland and before that I Believe it was France and they were the last two in Europe to allow for birthright citizenship [noise]\nThey've done away with it not a single country on the you're Asian continent from from ... to a a Portugal there is not a single country that has\nBirthright citizenship on the you're Asian continent there's not a single country on the African continent what fifty countries that has birthright citizenship but the news media wants to ... ... oh the president's wrong dirt thirty countries that have birthright citizenship\nI Would like to see what the rules are for birthright citizenship and places like Brazil and and ... by and see what sort of restrictions they haven't birthright citizenship\nI can assure you the New York times as busy right now not looking into that they are not going to report on that because they're corrupt and they're not journalists they're Democrats [noise]\nAlso I'm Jacob Howard the author writes stuff from him saying that it shall not include persons born in the U.S who are foreigners\nWell that takes in pretty much everybody is not an American comma aliens that would include illegal aliens in addition to illegal aliens so that speaks to the intent and then if you read the amendment over again with that in mind and by the way the amendment does it begins\nQuoting now from the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there up that's a key phrase right there that is subject to some interpretation are citizens of the United states and the state where they reside keep in mind this is about\nSubject to some interpretation are citizens of the United states and other states where they reside keep in mind this was about the Democrats and slaves okay this is and and it's a it's that I like to include the Democrats because they deserve to be included in all of this\nThis is about a freed slaves and uh the Democrats fighting against rights for freed slaves and for the children and the descendants of\nFreed slaves now I haven't gone to the audio President Trump was asked about this yesterday to an interview with ... and getting quite a surprising answer I think\nSome legal scholars believe you can get rid of the practice on ships so about changing the constitution and executive order that\nA lot about his helmet law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional member porcelain and you don't get\nSome constitutional scholars say that is true if you turn on CNN they scarf and nice ... and they're angry and that fraud browsing curled ... and they say not a single legal scholar in the world and the country would say that what President Trump says right that's false\nThere are legal scholars who say that what the president said his wrong um another others who would say that he's not wrong and that's why it goes to the courts President Trump how ridiculous\nWe're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas it's ridiculous and it has to end\nAnd it has to end it's ridiculous it's ridiculous than it has to end now the news media is just they got their panties all up again and ah\nAnd there there are very angry there but they're very angry every day they're very angry at President Trump constantly so it doesn't really matter what happened today they're angry at President Trump for it he continued\nHave you talked about the council yeah I have to wear in the process in the process it will happen\nWhen an executive order that's what you're talking about something that I didn't think anybody knew that but me I thought I was the only one\nI thought that was the only one that uh the new the president is tweeting this morning on his Twitter and he tweeted\nSo called birthright citizenship which costs our country billions of dollars that is very unfair to our citizens will be end in one way or the other\nIt's not covered by the fourteenth amendment because the words quote subject to jurisdiction there of unquote many legal scholars agree\nHarry Reid was right in Nineteen Ninety three I have this audio as well which you've seen by now\nBefore he and the Democrats went insane and started the open borders and started with the open borders which now brings massive crime stuff he says crimes the borders stuff I think that she's trying to express that as
