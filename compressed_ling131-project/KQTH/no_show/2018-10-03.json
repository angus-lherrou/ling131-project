now these people are so full of it\nNow let's go then they brought on this person who they claimed to be a a former prosecutor name was Laura coats she looked very angry and bitter she looked like a bitter and and I want to know what it is with the the bitterness and anger of black women in America today we had to look into that don't you think\nI'm just kidding but I'm\nReferencing the new narrative from the phony below the news media which is that white men are angry about all of us it's racist and that's missing trust but ah never mind all of that in fact uh we were contacted today now this is kind of funny where do they come to your today or yesterday\nNPR today\nNPR national panhandler radio called today and it's very funny they reached Victoria\nA producer of our humble radio show and this shows produced by its Victoria and Michael and myself the three of us if we're at NPR there'd be twenty two of us because it's not their money it's taxpayer money cycling up the tax payer teach day and night\nAnd they have a staff of twenty two people for a three hour show we've got three people they got taxpayer money we have to make our own money pay the mental electric bill to keep the lights on around here and all that stuff\nNPR called said that and there was some confusion that apparently they want to interview me they want to hear the ... you know you know what about\nAbout uh the anger of white men in America today the anger of white men today uh so I blew up their cars I uh what do you mean anger\nAnd that it was it was kind of strange of their cars blew up just as the ...\nAnd it was funny because the person calling from national panhandler said well a who's who does you're booking\nAnd Victoria was a little confused 'cause it's not like we have a booking department for our show [laughter] you know we have three people\nAnd the proper response is you know listen kitten listening to NPR we don't have thirty people doing a three hour show we have three people because this is the free market not the taxpayer teach\nJust ah just by the way and there were still debating whether to do the interview with ah with NPR oh they're the angry white man this is that so they called me I'm Hispanic my name is ... call somebody else and I and I'm black parts near black so uh you know what do you I\nAs I was so like if I Do an interview with them I'd have to I'd have to do my NPR voice well I don't think there is a lot of anger among white males Tiffany I um I think that perhaps you should look at and chief uh if you're looking for angry white males Tiffany\nNow back to you would you like some peanut butter\n[laughter] and a spoon maybe we could [noise]\nSo let's go to Laura ... she seemed quite angry she was on CNN Today they say she's a former prosecutor but she looks like she's twenty six so I don't know where they find these twenty six year old former prosecutors for cable news all over the place apparently they got fired the first day and then go to work for cable or something like that but she was very angry that\nOur news twenty six year old former prosecutors for cable news all over the place apparently they got fired the first day and then go to work for cable or something like that but she was very angry that President Trump dared to a raise an eyebrow at Dr Ford's many many variations\nAnd ah and most of the so she came to her defense and I I Love her defense that made me laugh\nThey probably drinking all like I think that she didn't Patrick off here called they named the people who were in at the party in the

talking about I've never met Brett Kavanaugh\nBut uh uh uh Laura coats and and CNN they leave that out because of the most insidious power the news media has the power to ignore and what they leave out is often more important than what they put in and this is a good example of that this well here's what she didn't remember\nRemember the names of the people that were at the party um she didn't remember who's house it was that what year it was ... months it was what day it was what neighborhood it was uh how many\nPeople were there changed again and again what the gender composition of the number of people there changed again and again one beer but she didn't know how she got there she didn't know how she got home a and did she recovered this and repressed memory therapy\nAnd if you're
