Europe and uh and it's ...\nAnd the last two years even in Paris and France and Germany and\nAnd Western Europe and uh and that's because President Trump came in you know rock above watched ISIS spread from Aleppo to twenty eight countries or something and army that were committed genocide that rock Obama and the news media ignored against the disease and so on\nAnd I'm Brock Obama didn't\nDo
