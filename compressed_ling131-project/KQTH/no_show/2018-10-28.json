dying from our diets in fact the center for Disease Control published a fact sheet\nThat indicates that poor nutrition and lack of exercise or the number to cause of death in this country and at the rate we're going if we keep this up it'll be number one very soon\nIt is it's sad but you know we're we're we're not in a situation where we are starving\nNo unfortunately the foods that were eating or not as nutrient dense as they used to be for example vegetables back in the Nineteen sixties okay they were fifty percent more nutritious than they are today because there were more nutrients in the soil\nEven if you're trying to eat a healthy diet trying to get those fruits and vegetables you still may not be getting the nutrients\nExactly yes that's very true and then when you add the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides you've got a recipe for a lot of malnutrition ... city and disease but you know the good news is there's a lotta nutritional benefits from the sea and that's what we're learning about and that's the title green so that was really\nExciting I mean there there are some remarkable discoveries now coming from the ocean\nYes even the FDA the food and Drug

osteoarthritis throughout his body\nAt the same time I had fibromyalgia right so I was really on a quest to find something all natural to help him have a better quality of life and for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time\n... ... let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on glucose I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that emu oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right through your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain\nI took a new oil and glucose ... mhm I use Boswell law which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay realm Elaine that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory less than a natural organic sulfur that is also just as important as glucose in Maine and rebuilding and repairing our joints\nAnd so I put that altogether and ice cream\nThat actually has no odor it's Greece list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain and doesn't irritate your skin\nGoes in Fifteen minutes later you have freely and so that's why I'm here\nTo share what I Know and show that I had right

... okay you get the information to go down in the body heal itself\nThe body heal itself provided you get at the raw materials that needs I'm giving you what you need for your body to take over and do the job it was meant to do and that's he'll okay and this is safe enough and you have to worry about I have to worry about thing\nIf you're taking a drug for pain it won't conflict with that at all

pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that\nPerhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with the with these drugs out there but looking at it from a natural standpoint\nAnd Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again that when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue to have the problem and\nAgain we've been talking about Dr Janis ... cream and this is this is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and there's this good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme in is how minimal it is it's going to get you with me\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer ... pain from ten to five and on down the line with continue to use ... mind telling you that's very doable yeah so this has really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand because very unique this is a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Jana\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried to all of my things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't work\nFirst of all for ... for MSN for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the airline industry here taking into early to three months people gave up\nAnd when you call

parental venue Frankenstein Castle for the ... script [noise] factors if none of the above because the Halloween capital\nOf the world just happens to be Salem, Massachusetts where in sixteen Ninety to the infamous which trial took place\nIn that year some three hundred twenty six years ago two hundred people were accused of practicing witchcraft and twenty of them were executed\nBut the years since I've been very kind to Salem because now it's a great town and a booming real estate market it's location just north of Boston and right on the water is a top destinations for homebuyers but do those people know about its past\nWhile yes yes they do let's find out all about Salem now and it's real estate where the local pro joining us is Pam Mickey real chore what the color Williams ... in Salem, Massachusetts bans are real estate professionals\nThese inventory is quite low\nOh it's way way down yeah ... you know things selling in less than a day\nIs that right so a very hot market in the north shore to Boston\nVery hot\nSo Pam do people really moved to Salem because of its be wishing past\nAh it's actually huge and people didn't move here because of it we have a larger waking population which believe it or not is a real religion that people don't realize\nYou're kidding no no and we have a lot of a story than and things that cater to that population here so it is a big draw\nIs that right so a typical homebuyer comes to your office and says I'd like to see what's available in our price range in Salem, Massachusetts how does that conversation go does the which thing actually come up during your talk with them\nYou know what comes up a little bit to be honest with you but most of our history is based on merit time and um you know are Eighteen century architecture\nI see so tell us a little bit about that what what I find if I was looking for a home in Salem and if I was looking for some of the local attractions\nWell homes and families can range anywhere from things that we're both at sixteen hundred while too you know converted loft in downtown to more residential neighborhoods were split level homes\nI see and you mentioned this maritime passed I imagine you have a Lindy interesting seaport area\nOh it absolutely stunning and in fact I don't know if you realize Salem was supposed to be the capital of Massachusetts\nIs that right it is but um fortunately our harbor was a ...\nInteresting so as we mentioned Pam Halloween is this coming Wednesday when you see a lot of visitors to Salem because of his past involving the witch trials\nFor sure [laughter] they're our tour buses throughout the month of October but Halloween day we can easily double our population if not more\nIs that right just for the one day so if I\nCome there and I'm interested in sort of learning more about the witch trials are there things to see are there places to go\nOn many places to go many tourists that two tours of some of the uh local cemetery that you have a memorial marker is there are museums in reenactments\nReenactments yeah [laughter] what do they have the Dunkin' share what do they\nKnow they have the the accusers\nThe accuser so you stand in a circle and everyone in town points that you how did you see\nPeople who are addressed in period costume downtown reenacting you know running through the city and and yelling and screaming and following the girls and\nThat is fascinating yeah [laughter] so Pam do you like working in a town where the Halloween themed to it\nFor the most part yes because you have to realize people come from all over the world to visit here just for that\nNow I understand your husband owns a retail shop in downtown Salem ... the barking cat that all about [laughter]\nIt does sell cat and Don products\nSo I see so it's a pet supply store it is\nSo it has nothing to do with Halloween or which is or black\nCats know although that is mandatory on sale and by the way it's a really yeah you

appreciate you joining us from Salem, Massachusetts the site of the witch trials three hundred plus years ago\nYou sure you're joining us from Salem, Massachusetts the site of the witch trials three

up on real estate today just applying for a mortgage make you want to hide under the bed\nKnowing yourself going into the transaction can shine some white do those dark little corners of mortgage lending scary things ... come out to make you feel uncomfortable\nThat's coming up on our special show scary thing [noise]\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology report\nSingle one of his does every single\nDay right there in our very own homes charging our smartphone it's an important topic because after all so much of our lives and our real estate happens on our phones these days so you need to keep that phone all charged up\nBut you know how phones keep getting better and better well part of those improvements involve charging improvements that can help make that daily chore easier and faster than ever\nThere are two types of new charging jak you need to know about one is high speed charging the other is wireless charging we'll talk about both of them starting with high speed\nThe company Qualcomm came out with what it calls quick charge a few years ago and many of the more recent phones had it\nBasically it charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour now that's really fast and then the speed slows down to protect the battery and the rest of the charge takes about sixty minutes\nNow not all phones have it but you can find a list of the ones that do that the Qualcomm quick charge website just search quick charge\nOkay so quick charge is great but you still have to plug it in right well right but that's another area where the tech has gotten better\nThe old us be many conductors word the industry standard but you had to plug them in right side up or they wouldn't go in\nToday's a USB stick and actors can be plugged in right side up or upside down and they worked just fine same goes for the very latest thunder both connection called ... three\nOkay so that's high speed charging now wireless charging wireless chargers don't plug into your phone at all rather there cradle or desks or square blocks and when you get home just put your phone on it\nDone no plugs no cables just put the phone down and let the charging begin\n[noise] it's not as fast as quick charge but it's so easy\nWell knowing yourself going into the transaction can shine some light do those dark little corners of mortgage lending that were scary things might live and come out to make it uncomfortable you know if you know who you are as a borrower know where your finances are no what you want to know what you can borrow\nYou can go on with confidence and that won't scare anybody wife\nThat's awesome just walk right into that lenders office put out your hand shake and say I'd like a mortgage correct\nAwesome will keep I really appreciate

more economic data keep pouring\nIn and financial reports from various major companies are digested by analysts while key economic indicators are still showing signs of life in the economy along with a roaring job market and low unemployment\nThe fact remains that interest rates are starting to creep up in a big way and are feared by some to put the brakes on this red hot economy home sales in fact are slipping in some areas with prices falling\nAs mortgage rates have increased giving pause to would be home buyers\nAnd then some companies are reporting that Harris costs are starting to hurt their bottom line\nMeanwhile the Federal Reserve continues to dig it heals into the ground on rates saying quote we no longer need to be stimulating the economy unquote it is their job after all to keep inflation at bay\nThis has some on Wall street a little bit concerned as the long term effect of higher interest rates and the potential economic slowdown are still unknown\nAnd when there's a little uncertainty out there Wall Street starts to move in a big way now what does that mean for your money and your retirement\nWell definitely it means more uncertainty if you only rely on what Wall Street provides and here at Mayfield financial we think that is no way to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street retirements\nWay to plan for your retirement we don't think that you should rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nRetirement planning requires a careful thought process that involves many different moving pieces one of those is Social Security another could be a pension and for some the biggest piece is your retirement savings\nAnd when it comes to your retirement savings today baby boomers had been found to hold more stock market type investments than ever before\nPerhaps that's due to the lower returns sometimes seen in more of the fixed income type mutual funds on Wall street and it's also the result of this ten year bull market run\nHowever most financial advisors would agree you shouldn't have too much exposure to Wall Street or you're setting yourself up for potential failure what if another two thousand eight crisis hits us or worse\nThe drop in two thousand eight was so severe and so sudden most financial models didn't even fathom that kind of a loss retirement accounts across the country were decimated savings plans dash withdrawals put on hold income reduced\nWhy would we want to put ourselves through something like that again\nNow you've probably heard the saying before which some attribute to Albert Einstein but who really knows but the saying is insanity is doing the same thing twice expecting a different result\nSo what do we think the right thing to do is was definitely you don't want to do the same thing twice and have too much exposure to the stock market so our retirement planning process at Mayfield financial is a little bit different\nFor starters it's one that doesn't entirely rely on Wall street we've got to get it through our heads that Wall Street isn't the only place to keep our money growing there are much safer alternatives out there\nAnd even with that safety still have the potential to keep growing\nThis is what we call a safe money plan here at Mayfield financial it's an account set up and your name it could be\nAn IRA or rock ... roll over IRA and inherited IRA or a four\nO. one K. or even just regular saving money\nAnd in that account you can receive certain guarantees certain protections that even in the worst stock market you won't lose a dime\nWe help our clients right here in southern Arizona takes some of the wall street risk out of their portfolio we do this using our expertise in safe money planning and create a customized plan for you\nOr at least a part of your portfolio is one hundred percent protected from Wall street risk\nSo if this sounds interesting to you and you'd like to de risk some of your portfolio all you need to do is make a request for your free safe money book\nIt's a no obligation free offer that we send to you from right here in Tucson and it's a real book and it's yours to keep writing take notes on you name it\nAll you have to do is ask for it called me at one eight six six seven for nine seven two three three or visit us on line at Mayfield safe money advisor dot com\nThat number again is

line\nYou don't want to end up like the falcons they put the game on the line with that play and lost now your retirement your life it's much more important than just a game so don't put your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market there's so many risks from all sorts\nImportant than just a game so don't put your entire nest egg at risk in the stock market\nThere's so many risks from all sorts of different avenues especially right now there are so many economic or is out there and talk of a slowdown we're seeing action on tariffs and trade wars and rising interest rates\nEven major investment from some of them are telling their clients to get out of the market and that we are quote in the last hurrah of the market I don't care what you think about what's going on in the White House or how the media is portraying everything when it comes down to it\nThe economy and Wall Street are going to do what it does on its own\nEconomies are cyclical it's always been that way and it always will and the fact is right now we're seeing signs that were near or already at the top\nAlan Greenspan put it best when during the dot com bubble of the nineties he said he saw quote irrational exuberance\nNow maybe it hasn't reached that far maybe it has you'll be the judge so even if you have a Wall Street portfolio now but you feel like you're safe with your bond funds\nDon't fall into the false sense of security that you think you might have innate bond fund now I spent ten years as a Wall Street advisor and many advisors they don't talk about this but a bond fund or bond mutual fund or ATF\nThey all have the potential to lose principle value you may think that they are safe because they send a bond but unfortunately it's a bond fund that managed by Wall Street\nAnd it trades

[noise]\n\nYou're listening to worry free financial solutions with your host me even further ego welcome\nBack to worry free financial solutions I'm Nathan fritter Rico a safe money retirement specialist in financial retirement planning there are two separate and distinct time periods in our lives the\nIs the wealth building an earnings phase this is a time when we are working trying to save\nAnd it's a time when we contribute to things like for one case to IRAs and other retirement planning accounts and during this time the stock market is one of the most powerful tools on the planet and should be used heavily in this accumulation phase especially when you're younger there's absolutely no doubting that\nThe second phase in retirement planning is the part where we transition from wealth building to wealth spending\nThe second phase officially begins when we are no longer contributing to our four one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives\nOh one K. were IRAs and now we need that money in that savings to sustain us throughout the rest of our lives it's a time that we need to convert assets into income\nAnd in retirement planning sustainable income is always better than savings so unless you're a super rich this second phase is often the most critical part in any retirement plan\nAnd it will determine your financial future and ability to provide for the long haul of life\nThis phase is so important that you need to prepare for it and your retirement plan to even enter it in some called this time period the retirement danger zone which basically tells us that you shouldn't wait until you retire to take action\nBut in fact the best time to plan for the second phase is about five years before you retire\nWe need to plan now for retirement because of a shift that has occurred in how we said in retirement\nIn the past we used to have these things called pensions perhaps you've heard of him and perhaps you're lucky enough to still have one\nPensions provided financial security and stable income in retirement now most of us don't have pensions anymore and we are put into a different retirement planning vehicle the mighty four O. one K.\nFour O. one K. and IRAs are one of the most powerful savings tools in retirement\nEspecially when we are in the wealth accumulation and earnings phase of our lives this is because we can harness the power of the stock market and if you have a four one K. or an IRA and when you're in your forties it's okay to have some volatility while I understand no one likes to lose money\nBut if you're in your forties and the stock market goes down you still have plenty of time for that stock market to recover and through your retirement plan to stay on track\nHowever as you are getting in your late fifties early sixties or even later for one case in IRAs only in the stock market are terrible at providing any sort of guarantee of income or safety\nRecently I heard a story about a couple in their early seventies that had kept all of their savings in their four one K. and the stock market\nWhen they had retired some years prior they had just left their money alone and didn't seek any advice on what to do thinking that it had done pretty well for a number of years and there was absolutely no sign of slowing down\nThen during the stock market crash in two thousand eight they lost over thirty percent of their savings and or even forced to re enter the job market to build up their savings again now that is no way to retire\nThis couple didn't take action to protect that part of their portfolio that they needed to count on when it mattered\nAnother couple about the same age and in the same time period they did take action and had a plan in place that provided them with guarantees and with safety\nThey sailed right through the financial calamities of two thousand eight like nothing even happened they didn't even lose a single penny\nThis is because they have the right plan in place with the right financial instruments that provided safety of principle and guarantees this is the power of having the right plan in place one that can provide you with the safety security and guarantees you need in retirement\nHere and Mayfield financial NSA protection services this is what we call a safe money plan\nYou need in retirement here and Mayfield financial NSA protection services\nThis is what we call a safe money plan\nAnd we've been doing it here for over twenty five years and we believe and know that for at least they part of your portfolio your four one K. or IRA or any savings for that matter that you are going to want to have that held in a one hundred percent safe\nNever lose value account no matter what happens on Wall street\nThis type of plan also has the potential to provide you with a stable income that you can count on year after year and it even has incredible growth options that keeps your money growing and ahead of inflation\nAre safe money plans do not create any taxable event if you transfer in from a four one K. or an IRA and you were only taxed if you withdraw the money just like an IRA and of course Ross IRAs are still tax free\nSafe money plans can handle and take care of your required minimum distributions and have the ability to provide an income stream that you simply can't outlive all with one hundred percent beneficiary transfer options with little to no fees and of course no commissions paid by you\nSo what do you need to do\nYou need to take action now before it's too late take action while the stock market is near all time highs you need to take action now before the financial storms come and you know they will it's just a matter of when\nTo get
