picture is over the weekend\nOf this caravan 'cause I was wondering what both thousand people were like trying to get here from Mexico and the end the phone number ... ... people carrying a boy wired

captured almost one hundred ISIS terrorists in Guatemala that's what he said\nPresident says ... had captured quote close to one hundred people completely linked to terrorist issues with ISIS and that not only have we arrested them within our territory\nBut they have been deported to their countries of origin St Guatemala they'll deport dress in a heartbeat [laughter]\nSo should we have the same immigration policies that Guatemala have I think perhaps we should President Trump's so he's under President Trump also mentioned I'm a possible is one of those elements and all that Democrats don't care that's ... ... what do they care President Trump\nThink there are wonderful people you got some bad people and those groups you got some tough people in those goods and I'll tell you what this country doesn't want them\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThat's a a new twist on an old theme there it's a a America's the land of immigrants the land of refugees I'm all in favor of all of that I really am\nI genuinely and sincerely am I my my building I live in a building in Washington DC I live in Washington DC and I live in a building or Washington DC and my building is like the United nations\nThat are ... eleven languages spoken on my elevator over the weekend a with me in it at a in my building and my neighborhood forget about it and and uh and that's great I think that's wonderful\nBut we have immigration laws wherever system for immigration and it isn't let's get thousands of people with foreign flags in March up and we have a list of demands because that's not going to work you know we might have to let the Democrats loose on 'em with fire hoses and dogs\nAre they they they don't do that anymore or they just do that when somebody wants to exercise their right to free speech things like that Fox News center reporter William a larger ness down to the border between may call and go walk them a lot\nOf Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world Honduras has the highest homicide rate in the world outside the door\nHas the fourth highest murder rate in the world go off my law has the I I Do that kind of like ... um has the fifth highest homicide rate in the world you should probably um work on that\nShould see what you can do about that to decrease the homicide rate just see Tallahassee also you know Gillum is his name right the Democrat running for a Senate in or for governor rather in uh in Florida\nAnd um hid under his watch under his to twitch under his leadership Tallahassee now has a the highest murder rates\nIn the states and they've they've shattered the record for for Tallahassee um and and I guess that's a point of pride or\nSomething um [noise] but if you're a Democrat it's not really a big story or I suppose because\nYou get promoted it's like round the manual it's like broccoli ... organized the south side of Chicago good job there and I was elected to the Senate from the state house the U.S Senate from the state house in Illinois and then the president the United states because he fixed the south side of Chicago which is like\nAleppo right what's Aleppo\nOr let's go to William ... done along the ...\nWhich is like Aleppo right what's Aleppo or let's go to William ... done along the\nBorder and um it it's true though this Gillum guy at the the the homicide rate in Tallahassee has shattered all records and that's not even something that reflects on him at\nAll why why would that be a problem\nHere Democrat it's really not a problem All right let's go because William watching us with Fox News yesterday I was watching this live yesterday afternoon and William ... was speaking to one of the organizers of the caravan\n[noise] his name he said was Luis and Louis was wearing a vast like he's a crossing guard you know as with the reflective orange stuff on the vest and\nWilliam ... spoke to him because he was at a designated as a spokesman and one of the organizers of the thing and I said what you know when these people get to the United states what what did these people want why are they fleeing their homes in Central America what are these people going to say when they get the United\nStates [laughter] probably all say something I don't know they were probably ask [laughter] they they get into something they can say I mean I have all the kids they can go to school so they can apartment and they can go to work\n[noise] so they can get but their their kids aren't with them so they want to bring their kids and after they get here 'cause it's mostly adult men\nThat are that are coming in but I didn't hear him say anything about a living in fear about uh the crime the gangs the the cartels I didn't hear anything about that it probably has to give them something\nSo they can have stuff so they can stay so they can get an apartment so they can get a job so their kids can go to school\nYeah All right well okay\nI understand that I I genuinely do I understand that and for that we have something that we call the immigration system\nAnd you go to the embassy in your country and you apply\nAnd you know now let me let me ask you this sort of any half wedded live out their\nLet's say somebody gets on an airplane in Aleppo and flies to Cairo and then flies to London and then flies to New York and gets off the plane and says I'm here to stay I Want to live here I I I got on a plane and I came to the United states because now I'm here and\nI'm not leaving\nIs that how our immigration system works is that our immigration system should work is that how the immigration system of any country works or should work\nThe answer is obviously know Luis\nWas asked by William logic us they said well look the president said he's going to ah\nHe's going to shut down the border as you\nBring this caravan up toward the United states the president said he may call it the military and he's going to shut down the border but listen Louis knows she paid attention last time around the Democrats ginned up that whole fake news story completely fake huge lie that's like the red solo cups story\nThat Trump\nOf a zero tolerance policy in a part of that was true separating families like never before none of that was true Obama separated them all the pictures that they use word from the Obama administration\nBut listen Louis learn and then because of the media slash Democrat but I repeat myself pressure or the president was forced to basically let the caravan and they were process\nSo the media slash Democrat but I repeat myself pressure or the president was forced to basically let the caravan and they were processed\nThey were let loose in the country catch and release because the Democrats were and their allies in the media were able to manipulate public opinion with fake pictures they're real pictures but they were from Obama putting children and cages and Obama literally did turn people over to caregivers\nSome of whom used them as slave labor including sex slave\nLabor children handed over by Obama personally\nJust getting it wasn't personally but it was his administration if it were Trump handing kids over to people that use them as slaves on a chicken ranch in Ohio which is what happened during Obama\nWith kids living in a in a chicken shack with a bucket as a bathroom because the Obama people handed him over to the flavors\nAnd there are literally slave labor\nIn Ohio the children that were handed over by Obama and that story just got nothing\nNothing because I don't care about children they don't care about human life they don't care about slavery in our care about the sexual abuse of children and their documented cases of the Obama people handing children over\nTo people who are not their guardians who than uh the cereal a sexually abused them but you know let's not get all caught up in that ... was watching the news and he knows last time around President Trump said he wasn't going to let them in but then they got him so what'd Lewis said yesterday\nHe had that last ... last time and we we take over there but he opened the border fool them all and then people will say voter yeah Neal radio in the United states\nSee he said that last time but he opened the border for them and all the people that went up there already in the United states so this is a success story for the Democrats below sea and Schumer high fiving in front of the TV when they're sitting there watching Fox News yesterday and ah\nAnd then Louis said well I mean you know it's an and William lodging assassin so if you're an important if you get turned back then what\nHave they do and back they throw it away they send them back our country we come back\nWe're coming back we're just come back well you know I'm [laughter]\n[laughter] that's not acceptable and then once again just in case it wasn't clear enough what are you coming for coming because you're fleeing the horrors of ah go up a model\nOr why are you coming\nBy these guys going for work [noise] well yeah we will find a job so we can help our ... our family on bringing some food and medicine or some other stuff that we need the feminine eat", "show_name": "no_show", "year":
