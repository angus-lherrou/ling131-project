nutrition or poor diet yeah for nutrition and you were saying before how how seaweed is really a great source now though that as a country we should look to the sea\nFor these nutrients that we're not getting exactly and maybe your talk a little bit about title green because title greens really is formulated with seaweed right\nYes in fact it's actually a blend of three specific types of edible brown see wheat kelp mhm few 'cause that's the closest and Elyria escalate into\nNow why these three specific see we\nWell Chris as we mentioned there are over twelve thousand species of ... but these three specific seaweeds have been clinically studied\nFor their powerful health benefit icy count for example that contains numerous minerals that your body needs like algae and a gas it okay and that binds with the impurities in the intestines and\nHelps to just carry him right out of your system so think of them is like having a garbage man in nearby I see okay and then few 'cause that's the closest contains trace amounts of iodine which hopes to stimulate the thyroid and that will in turn accelerate your metabolism and also we'll hope to lower your blood sugar levels\nAnd normalize those glucose levels so you're not going to be constantly hungry and creating all the wrong food on it\nAnd for women it's been very helpful regulating the hormonal effects of mental pause and PMS\nAnd ...

potassium iodine iron and zinc\nAnd then of course the vitamins vitamin a B. one be to be six nice and vitamin C. pathetic acid and folic acid there's even trace amounts of vitamin B. twelve so the

southern Arizona in St Louis thing is a member of the national\nAssociation of insurance and financial advisors promoting sound financial planning right here in the Tucson area\nAnd now here to talk with you about worry free financial solutions and retirement your host Nathan brighter ego\nWelcome to worry free financial solution [noise] I'm Nathan Frederica vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset and retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nStock market the sock continues as one day we're up and then the next day it's back down [noise] so what exactly is going on in the financial\nWorld and on Wall street and what's driving markets today now that the stock market has officially experience it confirmed stock market corrections were values dropped by ten percent or more for many peak volatility is back in a big way\nOne of the major factors that has led to this correction besides the ... market melt up we saw in January where we saw stock markets up over seven percent Justin one month alone\nIs now all the talk about the end of free money\nWell you may want to know what is exactly free money and why didn't you get any of it well you did actually in a way but maybe not how you exactly wanted to get it the end of free money is referring to the massive quantitative easing stimulus programs at the Federal Reserve\nEstablished shortly after the big financial meltdown in two thousand eight and two thousand nine\nThis economic stimulus was designed to boost the economy by injecting low cost or even no cost capital or money into the banking system and on Wall street\nThis is called in was called quantitative easing also known as Q. E. and we had to eat one you eat two and three and then she we infinity\nNow here we are and the feds have officially ended quantitative easing back in two thousand Seventeen during this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation\nEnded quantitative easing back in two thousand Seventeen\nDuring this almost ten year period of stimulus inflation was still very low and yes did it work maybe but what did this quantitative easing or this free money really give us well it gave us low interest rates and most of us have benefited from that in some sort of way\nPerhaps a low rate on a house or a car or a business loan we become addicted to these low interest rates\nSo has Wall Street lower rates also means low saving rates on bank money which causes us to seek higher returns elsewhere\nLike in the stock market and well that has worked wonderfully over almost a full nine years now so here we are at a critical point in our history and our economy with inflation fears now at the forefront of discussion we've already seen interest rates now taking a little higher\nWe're now seeing spikes in the yields on what most consider a risk free investment and that is the ten year treasury note\nWhen inflation starts to become a problem well the Federal Reserve will respond and the only way they know how\nAnd that is by raising interest rates and when that happens when interest rates rise that can start to put the brakes on the economy and then our whole economic cycle starts to change and our time of grow turns into a time of contraction\nNot that that's the idea of the Federal Reserve to cause a recession but it's just the nature of the beast it's economics\nAnd when that happens or there is even the slightest indication of something like that happening Wall Street is way ahead of the game on this and we'll start to see yet another bear market and perhaps one like we've never seen before where we can see drops of at least fifty percent or more\nIn the depths of the stock market bloodbath after the crash in two thousand eight early two thousand nine the Dow Jones was trading adjust sixty five hundred that was the index level\nIf we returned to those levels again\nThat's a Seventy five percent drop from where we are today so again we're at a critical point one where the stock market still just hasn't made up its mind as to what it wants to do\nSo why risk all your portfolio on something that seems to be just pure chance\nOur message here at Mayfield financial is different\nAt our core is the principle of financial safety safety is our number one concern and priority that your money your savings that you work your whole life to get our protected and that your portfolio has the right amount and the right balance of safe money\nIn this Wall Street dominated financial world that we're in too many investment advisers and individuals try to seek sky high returns and run the odds it's all probability based it's about calculating risk\nAnd hoping that a worst than worst case scenario won't ever happen during your retirement\nTo me and for all of us here at Mayfield financial that simply doesn't work\nI don't like running probabilities when it comes to retirement\nI Want certainties I Want guarantees I Want a retirement plan that puts safety first and where risk isn't measured by what stocks and bonds you have in your portfolio but as measured by their risk of losing your comfort\nYour house your income\nThese types of risks are the real risks we want to consider when planning for retirement\nSo there are many questions to answer when it comes to knowing what to do with your retirement money in your savings and how to best position yourself for the long term so what is the answer\nWell it depends it depends on what you want to do in retirement most of us want at least are essential needs met and want to continue the lifestyle that we're comfortable with throughout retirement\nSo here at Mayfield financial we are a
