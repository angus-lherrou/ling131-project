John Brennan's name on the package sent to CNN attention John Brennan only problem is John Brennan doesn't work for CNN and he works for MSNBC and for NBC\nSo emailed it to the wrong network so that's all right misspelling dumb point sending to John Brennan at CNN where he doesn't work dumb point misspelling Debbie was a man ships name we miss melt misspelled ships\nAnd uh she misspelled shields and he also misspelled Florida now the packing\nTags are printed on computer paper they're not handwritten printed on computer paper and it seems to me that if you're writing on your computer or your

complete contempt for your fellow Americans and for Trump voters because you watch MSNBC and CNN and you know\nThat you're smarter than all the Trump voters and they're going to misspell everything they're going to misspell not only Brennan and ... they're going to misspell Florida\nAnd what kind of a you know hillbilly robe what what what are the stamps what day by day by those American flags stamps even when you're delivering bike courier you put the stamps on with the American flags that's another red flag that's another clue I it it it looks like I'll come at the clock was bombed and uh\nAnd and that's a ... you know it's not really a ... how's it going to detonate it looks like it's not a serious thing\nThat's another clue now does that tell you that it's a lefty maybe a dozen maybe it doesn't and and that's the truth maybe it does and maybe it doesn't all of this good man you got a really dumb right wing guy who can't spell ... can't spell Brennan can't spell Florida\nKnow how to use this computer but was able to buy all these pieces assembled them make them look good you know the police are looking out who's buying the PVC tubing and\nWho's buying these digital clocks in bulk that got ten or cheaper by the does on the Internet or something like that they've got video of a career delivering at CNN and there's lots of video cameras there are lots of video cameras around Manhattan\nSo you can follow him out of the CNN Center a giant building and Columbus Circle and and the whole neighborhood is going to have lots more cameras where you can follow this person around and you can get a lots of clothes there\nI Want to know where I met as we're talking about the clock but but here's the New York post and I just read from the the New York times that uh they said that they talked about and experts who said this doesn't look like a real bomb and it looks like it's not designed to actually go off\nIt looks like a movie bomb the clock is stupid that's awesome meds radio shack bomb\nAnd all of that but here's the New York post with more talking about the device that went to George Soros his house which was apparently delivered by career also and I can assure you be billionaire George Soros he said you know that he's a philanthropist he's\nHe he's a money market manipulator and I became very very wealthy and he's been messing with the United states and our principles ever since and the Democrats love them for it and the media too but I repeat myself\nThis was apparently also delivered by courier I think there are going to be lots of cameras around the the billionaire George Soros as property\nDon't you think I'm thinking so the police are going to be all over this the FBI NYPD as first rate counterterrorism operations and the FBI secret services involved come out CIA is involved\nIt's everybody's involved\nAnd the New York post reports today that a source briefed on the device at cirrhosis house and the one cent to CNN\nTold the New York post on Wednesday that's yesterday\nThat they couldn't actually have blown up the devices and this is what I'm reading right here that they couldn't actually have blown up because neither was equipped with a blasting cap or other means of detonating explosive material\nThe source said there was nothing to ignite there was nothing there\nNow if these are not real explosive devices but only\nHalf baked explosive devices then they're virtually identical to the castor bean attacks the pseudo rice and attacks we had [noise] and it wasn't just there was you know this guy was charged a

these rice in attacks early against all of these government officials CIA director FBI Director secretary of defense or chief naval operations turns out the guy was a navy veteran he's got to be for the navy but he's a Democrat he hates Trump one was sent to the uh the White House and to Trump\nAnd um and they caught the guy that is good but it was just after it and that was early October earlier this month then at the time of the Brett Kavanaugh vote there was another terrorist attack by left his with white powder and envelope sent to the home of Susan Collins Senator Susan Collins of Maine\nAnd also to Senator Ted Cruz now the news media doesn't care about any of these things that I brush them off and they say well the the powder was a nurse so it's not a big deal well the black powder here is effectively a ... because there is no way to detonate\nAnd uh that's that's important these are important clues at the scene of the crime\nAnd I expect I certainly hope that we catch this SOB real soon either way I don't care what his politics are I Want I'm caught anyway but just reading the tea leaves there are a lot of\nUh peculiarities they're a lot of strange little items here who is is the guy really so dumb that he misspelled okay you misspelled Brennan a B. R. E. N. A. and instead of in a you misspell she'll she'll leave off the the seat in shorts and then you misspell Florida\nAnd you don't catch that and you're so smart that you're out buying these parts in your building the thing and you're on the Internet you know looking at all kinds of websites how to build a bomb in the kitchen of your mom and your build these devices and you get the clocks and you're now you're saying you're and you're wearing rubber gloves and you got no finger bend you're so smart and you're doing this\nPretty advanced stuff right and you misspell Florida and you misspelled Brennan and you misspell shells\nAnd used the giant American flag\nUm things now now my friend Danny I talked to my friend any last night\nAnd here's his favorite clearly the saint of the crime\nThat leads him to believe that it's a Bernie Sanders fan the return address on all of the packages\nIs to Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida\nShe didn't get one mailed her oh Eric Holder was involved in this she didn't get one mailed to her but or should they be rejected for delivery to their actual destinations they return address was Debbie wasn't mention it now who despise us for if you're like a right wing not living in a cabin in them out and you're the right wing Unabomber\nDemi wasn't mention it hasn't been on the radar for a long time where she's irrelevant she's not she hadn't been on television and months\nShe might be having her makeup read tattooed on or something she's she's been out of the the limelight for months now so you can't hate what you don't see unless of course you're a huge Bernie Sanders fan and you still bitterly resents\nDebbie was a man Schmitz for stealing the nomination from Bernie Sanders to give it to Hillary Clinton who hates Debbie Wasserman Schultz right now\nSome right wing Unabomber living on a mountainside in a cabin or being bitter to Bernie Sanders supporters who feel that Debbie robbed them of the nomination\nWho hates Debbie Wasserman I I mean if you're out there I you know period Republicans here W's name and and sort of go eh you know but that's about it because she's she hadn't been a part of the discussion for ages now\nAnd she was replaced when it was found she was cheating and lying and stealing for a Hillary and uh and and I don't think Republicans are all burned up over Debbie was a mention it\nIn stealing for Hillary and uh and and I don't think Republicans are all burned up over Debbie was a mention it but I can tell you that Bernie Sanders supporters are\nSo now if you just pursue that line of thinking for a moment or a fraught the hate filled angry Bernie Sanders supporter is lashing out and and I don't like the you know false or a ... you know that phrase I Try to not use canned a heck need Washington phrases but this might be one of those or it might be a fake\nA right wing or a guy trying to pose as a write ringer and he thinks that also stupidity deliberately misspelled her name he thinks they have a flag on them at all times so he gets the big flag I'm a stamps and in the end the big joke is that a Debbie was mentioned it gets all of the mailings better rejected ha ha\nReally Debbie Walsh dramatic shift she was the last time the president mentioned that'd be was an engineer and he was a man shifts has the honor of having ...\nBecause when they learned that it's a lefty if they learn that it's a lefty there will act as though it's not one non story now it's not a terrorist attack now it's nothing now ... you know I I don't want to use the false flag thing but that that they won't ... view it that way they will just say\nThat now it's a non story now it's not what we thought it was now it's\nNot really a terrorist attack it was just a scare and they'll

matter of the devices\nI Want to begins tonight surrounded by addressing the suspicious devices and packages at the rally were mailed to current and former high ranking government officials [noise] my highest duty as you know as the president is to\nKeep America safe that's where we saw\nAnd uh and the president they're very upset that other news media that he hasn't been reading from their ... music like Obama does 'cause uh you know the Democrats say they all share the same sheet music so it doesn't matter but if you're stuck in the media is angry with you from the time to get out of bed in the morning\n[noise] whoever's bad they get out of President Trump yesterday\nThe federal government is conducted an aggressive investigation and we\nWill find those responsible and we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly [noise]\nCNN is upset that when he was a articulating the issues that he didn't specifically cite CNN for special sympathy and he acts\nOr threats of political violence aren't attack on our democracy\nItself [noise] no nation can sixty\nThat tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation co workers your or control we all know that such conduct must be fiercely oppose and firmly prosecuted\nYeah the president last night or in Wisconsin campaigning\nUm for Republicans there including Scott Walker or who is doing a great job their president ... and it's and by the way the news media tolerates violence on the part of the left all the time\nFrom antifa from occupy really tend to sort of the assassinations targeted assassinations of police officers across the country that's not being done because of Republican rhetoric\nThe suicide attacks by Democrats against the officers Ramos a law against police officers in Dallas\nPolice officers in Baton Rouge or against members of Congress in Alexandria, Virginia these are all suicide attacks suicide by cop and and suicide suicide as in the case of an issue mild Britain's lay and officers Ramos and Lou in New York\nUh and President Trump with the it's it's never going to be enough for the CNN's of the world they don't care if they're on a jihad\nWe want all the time\nTo come together in peace and harmony we can do it we can do [noise]\nDo [noise] you know how they will be no civility\nUnless a Hillary Clinton's team wins in the midterms ah we're we've already been told by the Democratic party's leadership there will be no civility unless they win the mid term elections\nAnd this is um you know this is part of the instability that they're ratcheting up in America\nWe people like me I certainly have been sitting here saying you know they're taking us to a bad place and this shouldn't be allowed in the news media just rolling over ... and pretending that they weren't that Charlottesville pretending those black bandana clad guys with big metal clubs smashing windows that those are no problem\nI'm pretending that the attack on freedom of speech and on Americans like Ben Shapiro and David Horowitz at uh UC Berkeley not being allowed to speak because of the mob and then objecting to the usa\nAmericans like Ben Shapiro and David Horowitz at uh UC Berkeley not being allowed to speak because of the mob and then objecting to the use of the word mob I Love that yeah mobs all over this country for the last three years they're all left these virtually and ah the news media just ignores them they turned a blind eye to President Trump\nMore broadly there's much we can do to bring our nation's again for example those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective after the [noise]\nOf moral condemnation and destructive routine these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop\nAnd then the news media says yeah well you stop because the act like five year old so literally they're not there is not an adult among them I Can't count an adult\nAmong there are a couple David Martin at CBS a CBS News I'll give him the adults that Pete Williams at NBC I like people that I'm receives good is a is an actual news reporter although he does worked for NBC President Trump\nNo one's carelessly compare political opponents to historical\nVillain [noise] which is done all Hitler son all the time Hitler gotta stop we should not\nMob people in public spaces or destroy public property what\nOccupy gonna do what is the left gonna do well as the as the as the weather underground and the red brigades are what are they are going to do President Trump on the media taking it to the media and then this morning I saw him they were taking umbrage rep is they take everything very personally because they're petty little girls\nAs part of a larger national effort to bridge or divides and bring together the media also has a responsibility to shed a little town map and to stop\nThe endless hostility and constant negative\nAnd oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nThe one thing is that if he weren't Hitler then they'd be more civil way now that Hillary has called for instability and bronco by Moscow and where are the Democrats on all of this where the Democrats on everything now Democrats where where are they on the caravan where where are you\nThere oh I have I gotten one yet huh cash I sure hope I get one but man with the in crowd and and I honestly if they find out that it's a lefty round all is said and done and maybe it's the Russians\nCould be the Chinese could be could be a lot of things if they find out it's a lefty the news media does well if we all find out that it's a lefty and the final analysis\nUm the news media would just drop it and stop talking about it they're just not that they don't know who James Hodgkinson as they don't know that he's a Bernie Sanders volunteer that are I mean I mean major news media figures that you see on TV they have no idea who James Hodgkinson as none\nThat they couldn't tell you who received a envelopes that were purportedly filled with rice and this month in repeated attacks this month two separate incidents involving rice in envelopes one over the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation one just against the Trump Administration in general\nBeing president of the United states has a a Twitter account as you may have heard and he tweeted this morning several things on the caravan but also on on this a very big part of the anger he said we see today in our society\nI'm a caravan but also on on this a very big part of the anger he said we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false an inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news\nHas gotten so bad and hateful that it's beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nFast I agree a hundred percent I've been calling this the the coming cable news wars the cable news civil wars these guys if anybody is responsible if any one entity more than the Democratic party more than the Republican Party more than the Green Party of the socialist party more than antifa\nThe problem the biggest problem is the news media is corruption\nAt CNN and the twenty four hour news networks that the people that are glued to the stations all day long or all mad you know if you're talking on the phone like oh my God you believe it was great you know that they that they watch to much cable news and James Hodgkinson\nWho shot congressmen states Gleason tried to murder everybody else and was shocked to that thankfully by brave police officers there at the baseball field that day and another suicide attack by another Democrat on a mass murder mission amass political assassination\nA and the news media just just a just blew right past that story that that had nothing to do with democratic where he was a big MSNBC fan now MSNBC had nothing to do it in the media their rhetoric\nHe loved Rachel Maddow you wrote about her long and ugly and ah and Rachel Maddow got I just got a clean bill of health on that one they all just get a free pass on this stuff\nAnd you know their rhetoric Rocco dolled up in Hillary Clinton and the Democrats the rhetoric against the police as getting a police officer whether these assassinations whether these targeted murders of police officers\nIn the dozens now across the country just random pop up and murder police officers not know shoot out during a robbery or something\nBut targeted killings of police officers those did not happen before Barack Obama started his war against the police and now there are dozens of police officers that have been murdered in targeted killings and the Democrats and the news media but I repeat myself couldn't care less [noise]\nThe president also are treated this morning there is a a story the New York times has the story they are very excited about says that the Russians and the Chinese are eavesdropping on President Trump's phone calls but they weren't with Obama because Obama is pure and his phone is protected by a deity somewhere [noise]\nPresident Trump tweeted the New York times has a new fake story", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tucson", "day": "25"}
