literally helping millions of people out there regain their health and wellness\nAnd nitrogen and I I Want to get right into this I mean we're talking about\nPain today and it always amazes me that you know we have the technology to put men on the moon and bring them back again we did and yet we can't seem to get a handle on pain relief ... what's going on\nThe last time I was here it was estimated at forty three million Americans are dealing with pain in their body just astounding now that number has doubled to an estimated eighty six million American adults and that's why I'm here today I really want to talk to you about this epidemic well what kind of pain are we talking about here\nAll the ISIS rheumatoid and osteoarthritis and they got the first site is they tend to night is

syndromes ultimately\nBut I can tell you that there is a real natural solution that can help you get to the root cause of that mhm I created might as well ... to take that crane\nApplied exactly to

with seaweed right\nYes in fact it's actually a blend of three specific types of edible brown seaweed kelp mhm few 'cause that's the closest\nAnd Elyria escalate into\nNow why these three specific seaweed\nWell of course as we mentioned there are over twelve thousand species of ... but these three specific seaweeds have been clinically studied\nFor their powerful health benefit icy count for example that contains numerous minerals that your body needs like algae and a gas said okay and that binds with the impurities in the intestines and\nHelps to just carry him right out of your system

real estate in Des Moines Iowa\n... is a national dirty under thirty on hurry and is currently serving as NPR's commercial and business specialties liaison for president Elizabeth mending hall of course to welcome back to real estate today\nThanks so much for having me back\nWe are so glad you're here so of course the first of all how business\nIt's fantastic business is always good that's all I can\nSay that's wonderful so Christa your now thirty three years old twelve years ago you bought your first investment property [noise]\nBut I Know that even though you are a real estate investor your heart is really with your clients helping them grow a portfolio that will generate income and wealth overtime\nAbsolutely absolutely I you know I was lucky enough to have that opportunity then that's the age and given that opportunity the other is really why is that for me\nSo of course when you how a young real estate investor get started first of all how young is young who is your youngest investor ever\nYou know what I actually had a young kid from my home town actually that spot his first oh which actually Lebanon that night because it needed to work it was a foreclosure that he had found and he was willing to put to work at it and he had just graduated high school I was Eighteen\n[laughter] so yes I think he\nThe property and like you and then he had just graduated in may

through high school that show that I think on the cover that even in\nBe finance throughout the day or anything like that but he got the financing on his own he held a job through high school that show that good enough income to cover the payment and it was crazy it's by far the youngest\nIs awesome and so when people come to you and they're very young and they say I Want to invest in real estate what to tell you about the reasons why\nHonestly most young investors are looking to build a stable future which I think it's so encouraging right now because I you know our generation is is really good at only wanting to do the\nThings that they find fun and so I Love the fact that they actually eat you know investing in real estate of it sometimes doing ... and the hard work themselves as something that's a fun activity for them so I it's really encouraging for\nMe to harm want to invest in real estate in Bahrain my very first property am I going to ... you know a great credit be really solid reserves like money in the bank and see a really high income or not so much\nWell you know obviously life easier one of those things are are there but it's certainly not something that should stop you from investing actually you know one of my my biggest investors that I've been working since I first got my licence eleven years now\nHe's built a very impressive ... got hundreds of units across the state of Iowa a little bit you know across the border in Illinois and a breath guy\nAnd he bought his very first property on contract he ended up buying the property on contract from a landlord that was just tired of having every model every time a tenant moved out\nYou know you're paying your carpet things like that plans or rent it out and then felt like you know I put all of this Harvard into it I think I should probably try to sell it and you know it's sold right away so that's where he got his\nVery first mistake they start going so he bought his very first investment property on on contract with I think if I remember right it was something like three or four thousand dollars down with the owner financing situation and you just\nBuild from there so it's it's crazy what you can deal with a little bit of resourcefulness\nThat is awesome and among your clients are a lot of them young\nYou know they are I Will say that you know I built a pretty diverse client base which I'm very proud of it at this point\nBut a lot of my ... the the one that I was just telling you about that I've been working with for over eleven years you know he had been investing since he was in his\nEarly twenties he's now forty nine and has built something that and I consider forty nine young so especially that he'll go away he built and you know he started in his early twenties and he hadn't stops and so I Would say a good chunk of my investors are definitely what I Would consider young\nSo let's look at the big picture a person comes to you in their twenties and they start investing in real estate tell me how is that going to change their life as the years pass\nI'm sure you've heard this a million times and in a million different contacts on the on the show here but\nThe one beautiful thing about real estate is you make or lose money only one yourself so if you can buy into something early if you can start building that portfolio of rental especially and how you're paying your mortgage for you and building equity for you if you can do that at a young age the\nSky's the limit on what you can do because that first investment that second invested that third investment it's something that you can continuously snowball and role in the down payment options for a bigger investment and you just keep going and it grows exponentially in a way that you would never imagine on paper\nThat is great advice will ...

five years Mayfield financial has specialized\nIn building worry free retirement solutions for thousands of satisfied southern Arizona and Nathan is a member of the national\nAssociation of insurance and financial advisors promoting sound financial planning right here in the Tucson area\nAnd now here to talk with you about worry free financial solutions and retirement your host Nathan Frederica\nWelcome to worry free financial solution [noise] I'm Nathan Federico vice president and Mayfield financial inundate protection services incorporated an asset in retirement protection company right here in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\nHave you ever been in a situation where you felt uneasy [noise]\nWhen you place to yourself or been put in a situation that's high\nRisk perhaps just before you jump out of an airplane or dive into shark infested waters all things I can assure you I never do sorry just not my cup of tea and I realized that some of their loved the adrenalin rush that can come from things like that\nBut for most of us we don't like that feeling we don't like to feel vulnerable or feel an easy about something but how about financial risks where you might financially feel vulnerable again there's those that like these risks and the gambles maybe they bet on sporting events or at the casino\nAnd then there's those that leave everything up to Wall Street where some of the biggest financial risks can be\nAnd the scariest part is that a lot of the time if you have an investment portfolio you don't even know what's in it\nSo for retirement planning you want to have the right amount in your portfolio that has protected and safe and then the right amount that you can risk it's about balance\nWall Street what have you believe that they are the only place where you can find this balance\nThey threw out words like modern portfolio theory an asset diversification as ways to try to convince you that your portfolio is in fact balance the truth is that's not what having a safety first approach is all about\nTrue balance comes from having a part of your portfolio that isn't in any sort of Wall Street fund at all\nHere's the facts Wall Street is great at the risk game sure you can get big gains see huge returns when things are good but at what cost you've got to be willing to ride the ups and downs along the way\nThis is acceptable when you're still working and you're a ways off from retirement you're still buying and re investing along the way it goes\nOh is that it will come back it might take time but eventually it'll come back\nBut what if you're close to retirement perhaps are already retired well the stock market and Wall Street is not where you want to rely one hundred percent of your money on\nWall Street just isn't in the safety business they never have and never will be that's not what they do\nDid you know that so far in two thousand Eighteen and yes we are still on the tail end of a ten year bull market run the three biggest point drops in the history of the Dow Jones industrial average have all happened in two thousand and Eighteen\nVolatility is back in a big way so as you get older you probably start to look at risk and a little bit different way than you did when you were younger risk is now no longer just a bunch of numbers or what kind of volatility you can bear but\nIt's also a risk of your livelihood or your future livelihood your lifestyle\nThe money you've saved in your four one K. or your IRA or in other savings accounts it's what you've been working on saving for your entire life\nYou don't want that to go away or have your four O. one K. turn into what they call sometimes a two oh one K. which happened right after two thousand and one when the stock market crash and in two thousand eight after the stock market crashed\nThis is why here at Mayfield financial we don't advised to our clients to rely one hundred percent on Wall street\nAnd that's where our safe money
