informational things or one of the things you got to talk about this year he's from China he's got to talk about China\nAnd want to talk about the trade disruptions we've had an impact that might have on land values and and maybe it might be just a of impact might also have to think about impacts\nWhen it comes to hogs and that's the one we seemed quite been impacted and and the other courses and
