{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KGLO", "content": "They were not finding domestic beans more that they could access to because they were already booked headed that China and so they went back out on the world market are buying some from the U.S to help keep those crush facilities running I think we'll see that continue as we look out over the next few months\nBut the other thing I'm going to be watching here especially as we get into November December is do we see China if you will get back into the U.S market place\nBecause typically this is the time of year when they're sourcing it a lot of us soybeans\nHow much can they if you will wean themselves from us I think they're going to have to jump back in here at least a little bit over the next couple of months I think will still be down significantly but I don't think we'll be down Ninety two percent like we are now\n... I Know you and I talked in the past about them we market in or possibly the and some we acres hum ... corn and soybean anger you shifted back to ... to in a traditionally strong growing area of the U.S for wheat\nAnd you know we've heard a lot of talk about we both globally and domestically with some different challenges there were some pops and market prices are holding\nFairly strong there I Would say ah where's the we'd mark and that and how is that going to play into our our corn and soybean market moving forward\nWell as you mentioned here I mean I think the big thing is we're looking at wheat is [noise] I'm just like corn and beans or play supplies out there but there's a relative lack of food quality wheat as we look out there and that's going to play more into the spring wheat market and so I think we could see spring wheat\nTake some acres out of corn and beans especially beans as I look at the northern plains I Would expect North Dakota South Dakota is he out we're going to see some acreage move\nInto spring weight to help one failed that food we demand but also the relative pricing right now between wheat and soy beans is favoring wheat significantly as we look in the Nineteen thing that's happening ears on the winter wheat side\nWhile our harvest has been going slower than usual or slower than we'd like at least winter wheat plant things going on at about averages in fact emerges is running a little ahead of schedule\nAnd that could actually bode well for the livestock markets as well especially you know thinking cattle here for background the opportunities as we look at the southern plains is that okay we got some if you will some weight the feed out there that could help the cattle market\nShe had a producer overall before we move over the livestock I'm looking at corn and beans and marketing plan a for a trying to get rid of some of the grain is possible I mean we're seeing some decent prices especially the corn market if you look out in the next year\nOr what would be so long to Jetsons you have from users and they're making any uh end of the year ...\nWell after the leaders were looking out there you know out in the next spring and even you know look at it next year's crop next fall we are seeing some let's call them decent places to start\nPutting in some price floor is out there as we look there that the challenge is going to be getting to the next spring with this crop as\nYou mentioned with harvest sort of running behind we have some quality issues I think going in to this year that we're going to you know as we look to store this crop\nGoing to represent a challenge and so I'm looking at what a surprising mechanisms can I Do to\nAvoid a either let's call them storage cost or avoid worrying about quality issues so do I sell the crop now in in\nIn ... paper due I looked at just okay I'm going to put it in storage but monitored very closely but any way shape or form you look at it I think a lot of farm or you're trying to figure out how do I carry ownership of this crop out about six months so I can capture those high higher prices\nChat or against your reminds me to be on the markets are\nGentlemen started livestock here real quick before we run on time ah I Know this harm mark in a kind of taken a beating your this week it's a down a little bit again today\nAnd are really just a you know looking at the heart market waters some of the things you're seeing there and what could marketers do right now if they're trying to market any hard here in this fourth quarter\nOn thing about the fourth quarter as we have seen at least for the past month some strengthening back up a lot of that again are related to the export picture you\nKnow we talked a lot about China and the soybeans side but it was also a big impact as we look at\nThe whole picture but when I'm looking at exports right now there are up about five percent year over year we have seen some strength that only again thanks they getting the U. S. M. C. A. in place that we know Mexico and Canada are going to be in there but South Korea has actually been a shining star air force in terms of growth\nAnd pork exports helping hold us that he'll hold us forward here so I'm walking out there at those\nBeds right now we're still seeing you know these floating in here at least in the fifty dollar range you know February up is up over sixty and so we do have some halfway decent prices\nThat we can sort of hedge with right now to put in I get a price floor and hopefully look to continue to build up as we have over the past month\nChat on the canals side here real quick again seemed like the same story there in cattle were were down again and daddy I'm looking at that count market do water and some things to watch out for us we had the rest of the month\nCattle in the big thing I'm watching airs exports when I'm looking here we're up about Seventeen percent so we've seen good strong international demand\nWill against South Korea sort of leading that charge and so as long as we're able to continue to put good shipments out there on the export side that should help at least stabilize what we're seeing for the cattle market place say when I'm looking at the fee\nSide of the equation things more opportunities there one thing about the slow harvest it gave me a lot of moisture building um reserves for his religion for winter wheat graves on her ... conditions [noise] holding fairly well for us when we look at the\nShadow that sounds like to me overall the the biggest thing a lot of the news is hiding or in those export markets whether it's for grains or livestock or as we get to work for the rest of the you know\nIt really is I mean when we're looking at a domestic demand let's call that the flow stable but man that's not really moving all that much and so where are we going to get the swing that can either go higher or lower it's going to come from the international market life\nShe had we hope that we started seeing some more international movement and maybe in these prices up here before we get to the holiday season I've read on today here on keys yellow markets are very much at home talked me into\nIt like is
