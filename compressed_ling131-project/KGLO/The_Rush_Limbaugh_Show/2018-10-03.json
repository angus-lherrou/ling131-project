{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KGLO", "content": "Of course we can't confirmed that yet but all indications are that pretty a pretty good chance that that will happen which again it's just that we've been advocating for this now for a little over a year and that ... that need to move to higher blends of ethanol\nAvailability at the pope it's good for consumers that's good for the environment it's absolutely a good or renewable fuel energy producers and our our corn growers as well so this is good when when when and we're very hopeful that the the president will make that announcement airways in Iowa\nYeah we'll be looking forward to that announcement hopefully that's exactly what it is about\nAnd I'm Talking about so when so many of us are considering this so when the uh the NAFTA renegotiation effort has worked and Canada has agreed to a new deal which is not going to have the map to name now the the U.S Mexico Canada\nUm partnership something along those lines and what are your thoughts on that are here Mike and that we got the news earlier this week\nWell it was exactly the kind of good news that the that we have been eating is safe and so we take it as an athlete positive that yet but now the U.S Mexico Canada agreement or NAFTA to Plano\nUm but uh we have that all along that throughout this trade on certain days straight conflict to\nThat that we need it the administration to move forward on this afternoon you negotiate should vote with Mexico and with Canada Canada and Mexico are number one and number two trading partners here in Iowa so a lot lately important to us from a market standpoint so\nAre most important in this whole agreement is that we maintain that zero tariffs a treatment across those two borders\nThat but we also are hearing and understanding that there's an upside in terms of you access for us farmers in dairy\nEgg and poultry production as well so what are your way to get into that Canadian market\nAnd also an aunt some of our regulatory programs like things around biotechnology and approval there so I think ah we maintain what we add in terms of zero tariffs but we also open the door for some some upside growth there as well so\nThat that that is good news and it starts to build back that certain ... that we needed our marketplace\nWell Mike obviously good news for America agriculture still some things hanging out there no men are worrisome one of which now China and uh the word is out of Washington and now the NAFTA\nRenegotiated their song that the U.S may turn their attention to working something on with China and or\nWorking out something a with Southeast Asian countries like Japan and\nPhilippines and some of the other is over there are kind of centered around maybe something with the Trans Pacific partnership whether it's bad or whether it's something different a water you kinda hearing on that from what is the next step for us trade\nWell absolutely we uh we need to carry this moment of of the NAFTA renegotiation and two additional agreements and so there's no time to rest here\nOr we need the upper ... to move with some urgency and I think yes China of course we need to see progress there at the retaliatory tariffs that the Chinese have put in place against us products it's absolutely hurting our markets which is hurting our farmers and so we continue to urge\nIt desperation can move quickly to get the Chinese to the table and see some real progress but uh we need to be playing offense on additional markets as well so we had some good news last week that the United states and Japan had signed in in a\nStatement that indicates they will go she ate on a a a new trade agreement there Japan's an incredibly important market for us from corn and end up pork standpoint so yes we we we really need to see the administration moved now with the urgency and carry this momentum and two additional agreements\nAnd really re engage with those countries that were involved in the TPP agreement\nWill mine or the other thing too I'm sure you might be hearing about a on a gold and green energy today or maybe once I stopped you have in northeast Iowa north central Iowa or would be the farm bill we passed that\nLine I'm there that they had set in Washington I'm One of the latest on the farm bill where are we out I think there's a lot of uncertainty out there in regards to that right now\nAbsolutely you know again we we talk about this all the uncertainty whether it's trade the art that the farm bill and foreign policy again we we need to we need to start restoring certain key to what the market pardon bill getting that done what has been\nA a positive step it now it expired on the current farm bill expired on Sunday a I think there's a you know what we're watching this very closely to see will they be able to get to an agreement here before the end of the year\nUm or will be looking at some sort of extension of the current farm bill so for the most part a commodity programs and conservation programs continue to operate through the end of the calendar year without interruption a few things around trade promotion and in that market development that has to stop because\nOf the uh the farm bill expiring so we don't like to see that uh but I Know that the negotiators from the house the Senate or working still to try to come to an agreement so I think ah it'll be very telling here as we get through the election and then see what happens do we get a new farm bill before the end of the air or do we see some sort of an extension\nOn my job I think so for the insight on those two things we appreciate it we wish they traveled there's you uh make your way ah throughout the area here it's a day I should ask airborne let you go I Know uh the rain is kind of slowed down harvest how many fields used to be taken out out\nThere oh boy I was just going to say I wish we could get the weather to cooperate here I Know folks are very anxious to get out and about uh\nWe uh got into our our harvest that started last friday ran ran Friday Saturday and then got rained out so\nUh you know state why we're looking at were on schedule or not to wear a few days ahead on corn harvest at eleven percent and we're right on schedule with beans that was ... percent but obviously the wet weather widespread wet weather will uh will
