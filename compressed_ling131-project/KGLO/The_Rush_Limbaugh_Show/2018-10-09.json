Thirteen hundred cagey yellow Mason city Jesse Stewart here and it's time for our October safety message with the rest of agriculture safety foundation was right or wrong with our nation joining us now on the large lied Jenna David ... with the rest of my roles foundation Jim how are you today\nI'm doing great Jessie how are you\nI'm doing great thank you for joining us here today on cagey yellow for our October safety method you think back to last month there was no national safety and health month wait last month\nAnd are looking at this month now still considering that safety message of course uh with fall harvest around and talking about it now and fury safety and I think that's something that made it gets overlooked uh a lot of times around the forums yeah\nI agree I agree and I think this is the perfect timing that we just we just got off of a national park they can help me but let's continue on with a harvest season and other things that we can do to keep ourselves safe and protecting our ears is definitely one of them\nWell Janet tell us a little bit about protecting our ears I Know a lot of noise the farm equipment is around\nThe tractors to combine all that stuff is just going a pretty pretty constantly when when we get rolling in the field what are some things we could do to protect our a theory and it and kind of states have robes without equipment\nOkay well one of the most important thing according to the Centers for Disease Control and\nThat if the new wave or sound level of workplace exceeds eighty five that's the old a person should wear hearing protect or so there are so many different forms of caring protection out there and you know a lot of people they they just get to where it or you know it's inconvenient or are you at this job real quickly our next time\nBut gradual you know the gradual um noise that you hear every day you know if the ... so the damage might not occur immediately\nUm but it will occur overtime so good example is you know if you're out at the shooting range and you um\nEat fire a gun from ... from a shotgun it fairly close range you know you can have damage immediately but yet working around machinery or the large equipment you notice it overnight but eventually it's going to catch up with you and it's going to cause damage so that that's where a lot of the serious risk occurs\nYeah very very true um something that you you don't think about some of the damage could happen after the fact is well not just immediately right their water and things we could do to protect ourselves I mean you know ear plugs your mom think things like that would be good\nOr water some maybe tips in tricks you can share Janet\nOkay well what don't we really teach what are you an adult but we were recently with um the University of Michigan and dangerous ethical to develop a hearing safety chapter or are progressive agriculture safety days and\nThree of the main tips that we talk to our youth about and again\nSame for adults it with noise three key things that you need to do is protect your ears like you just said wearing ear plug your mouth but they're very important if you're not going to do that\nThe second thing you can do is walk away from the noise get away from that noise and then the third thing is to turn it down um by lowering the solar around you know listening and a lot of kids now with the air but listening to their music you know turning it in a lowering it down to um\nTo an appropriate level I tell of it and turn it down um or you know like I just got back to the second thing if you can't you can't control it walk away or or distance yourself from the noise I mean that's going to really help you\nUm later on in life a lot of thinking you know some of the damage it caused ourselves especially I think we're going to see it um increasing\nAs that these young people get older is it some of these that noise level not necessarily at the farm but by by the music that they're listening to their ear bud so we really want to\nEducate them early and so that they can they can make a difference later in life\nYeah and Janet I'm or think to me you know good thing especially this time of year\nBut maybe stop and think about some of those um you know these men are other things that are around that so we can count on a day to day basis that we may be um you know subjecting our ears to harm or being or out of all the time might be a good idea to stop and think about that wouldn't it\nIt really is and there there's so many little tricks that you can do to really um identify what the damage could be on your surrounding so on our smartphones there are so many that the readers that are most of the time of free download and you can download the app\nAnd then if you want to you know a test that noises that you're\nEighty eight and ... the equipment air around on machinery I'm the music you're listening to a ... you know we you know and I are blender or not it doesn't have a vacuum cleaner a lot a lot you know and\nYou can actually at that level ... meters and right on your ... that was I think they have to go out and buy anything real high tech and definitely um [noise] really meters out there I can get right from your smartphone and not get an idea of what\nLike your around on the base so that's definitely important my I I um I\nWatch a protector you're a month by the national safety council so yeah that's a good time to stop and reflect which Tucker years all the time I get my ... thanks\nVery true long I Know of course are\nYou hearing safety is one of the many topics that are covered in ... after ... days trying to educate our views on some of these different things that they need to be safe about and be aware of more than ... on the farm and\nAh just a around a round machinery and other things in general and I know of course I Will say you'd have to take place throughout the year\nThey they they only have a lot actually if you have oh at least a dozen or more on taking place Oliver North America\nAre training now started for 'em I train our court that the proper Nineteen teens and then they started on this topic Manitoba, Canada\nAnd they
