so the damage might not occur immediately\nUm but it will occur overtime so good example it you know if you're out at a shooting range and you um\nYou fire a gun from ... from a shotgun it fairly close range you know you can have damage immediately but yet working around machinery or the large equipment you know you don't even notice it overnight but eventually it's going to catch up with you and it's going to cause damage so that that's where a lot of the serious risk occurred\nYeah very very true um something that you you don't think about that some of the damage could happen after the fact is well not just immediately right there watering the things we could do to protect ourselves I mean you know your plug your mouth I Would say things like that would be good\nOr water some maybe

especially\nThink we're going to see it um increase thing as a young people get older is it some of these that noise level not necessarily a farm but by by the music that they're listening to their their is easier but so we really want to educate them early and so that they can they can make a difference later on in life\nYeah and Jana I Would say to you know it'd be a good thing especially this time of year or two maybe stop and think about some of those um you know\nLittle quip men or other things that are around that we encounter on a day to day basis that we may be a you know subjecting our ears do harm or being around it all the time might be a good idea to stop and think about that wouldn't it\nIt really is and there there's so many little tricks that you could do to really um identify what the damage could be a senior surrounding so on our smartphones there are so many deaths of readers that are most of the time of free download and you can download the app\nAnd then if
