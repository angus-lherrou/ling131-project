{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KGLO", "content": "Yeah and uh so what I've seen and heard a just a from my own efforts Martin it out in the field and then a a visiting with your hours um\nYou know we can tell from the road that plant uh\nIntegrity has deteriorated with all this rain um but you got to get in the field and kind of check to some of them it's just the tops of the plants are a little bit over a base of the plant and let your attachment is is still fine so uh it works like today we couldn't get that in the field\nUm but the remarkable thing um you'll notice as you go from the field is 'cause they'll they'll look better drainage\nThat probably didn't run a short on nitrogen\nUm are in a little better a situation and can probably wait a little bit longer and the other thing I noticed that as those fields that were uh treated with a ... or rent a full time also are showing more impact\nAnd look like they could uh wait a little bit longer so those are probably two key things that like rovers keep in mind is there a a decide which builds to get into first I think this will this go round honestly they're gonna\nThey're gonna go anywhere they can go and not get stuck but immediately after that they're going to try to put things in a reasonable harvest order and get as much grain and the bans possible\nVery true very true and soybeans ... rich I've seen some pictures I've heard some people talking about the different things going on now in various bean varieties ... in the open sea into breed German nation on some pods in these really wet fields\nOr water some things that produces need to consider if they're seeing any of those issues and there's soybean fields\nYou know it's it's a won't see what she's with the state of mind that Potter arts\nYou know essentially the whole deal is the seat is drive down completely I'm at now is really weathered it so as you as you swallow that fighting back up the odds are already shrunk keep can rupture that scene\nAnd uh it's just going to take a um some very careful heart but it's a more you want to be a heartless being that at times that that don't\nCreate a lot of impact of that faith as we're bringing it and they had these ... are probably going to help uh keep any more see from from falling on the down some other contraptions like that but as far as what's germinate it in the odd um I haven't seen any locally it seems like that flow farther south\nUm but it it most of that risk is going to be the fields that appear to be very mature ready to go as soon as\nThe ground allows those fields out there with a little bit of color and I'm Still showing ingrained in us down probably aren't as higher risk and so they can be on a you know later they needed west\nVery very true and I mentioned the fact that those fields that are mature 'cause that's what I've heard as well and obviously so many different maturity level is out there right now just with when a\nPlans were planted back in the spring and and looking at things overall you know we're here in the big numbers from USDA we're hearing some big numbers from other parts of the country but some of these weather challenges I'm might factoring into some of our final yield but like you mentioned earlier on a kennel wide\nRanges of bugles from supplements early harvest activity we've seen in a corner beans in what'd you say that's probably gonna be the case years we'd go throughout the next month or so we're going to be a bunch of wide ranging yields\nYeah I Would I Would agree that it's just got to have to be the case um\nWith the various she mean you see it in some of the fields and the number of cars that are are drowned out because it's not always the pond where there's there's no crop laugh but there's also a a very wide margins around that ... was extremely wet you know you have to be suppressed in that area too so\nI can uh other areas of the failed that are showing\nBigger numbers compensate for that um time will tell but uh uh getting ready to see some wild swings from field to fail naked acre\nRich judge our guest here on key geo loan to count as pro technical Ron I'm is\nRich let's switch gears let's talk a little bit about has ruined Roundup Ready to mix soybeans and looking at a Roundup Ready soy beans some of the early ... results we see now knows from what I understand have been a pretty exciting rich\nYeah pretty exciting especially the handful plots we've we've got now so far um\nThe the new entries on the line up we're going to bring in for this market probably five six different a new varieties available this spring\nAnd I'm quite honestly across the board they're showing that that you will we were hoping for over the previous products so many of these plots will will show one two three bushel advantage\nYou need some more data to really narrow it down but it it appears to me the uh\nThe new lineup as has just see improvements in some key tolerance of that this area of aids um\nThat new line up not only a solid on a sudden death that you know\nBut also has a uh some updated tolerance on the white ... side of things in a little bit better stand ability so if I look at that coming in to the next season it's pretty exciting to me just say that not only do we have a better deal level but we also have the power and it's just that a\nFitness area and need to handle those challenges\nIncluding the exciting thing for producers here because this is a time of year when they're making decisions that they haven't already for next year's crop and obviously Roundup Ready soy beans or something that uh it sounds like produces might need to take a look at\nYeah the the Internet's just going up because that mistake or or seeing even in fields or that have not been harvested or do we control system\nA despite the weather was extremely solid just having one more tool and they're a pay handle some of the stuff tell water happen other broadly fish is\nA good state very beneficial people are are extremely happy with the weight control they got all this was a difficult spring to a\nA spray we'd get hotter coach cheat on you know when their action and temperature and inclusion risk and those guys had that in their mind but this spring also David and the challenges you know the day the wind is right\nIs it to the money to even drive in the field and so I Can't get your prayer out there or it can be tough but there was a it's a pretty flexible September that healthy for a guy to struggle through the uh the issues that face and I'm spraying different size way some of them or\nTried to go in a little bit quicker because they had a window and with a a residual on the stand a crop festival that was definitely a benefit to often so so far so good uh\nWhat the meal that I've heard a out of the fields seemed like a there are probably more consistent\nThan corn or just a little more stability there yeah the drowned out areas are bad but beans are are pretty resilient and it seems like those are\nOn margins a later age and they were able to flex back and and uh I I think the being able to be All right up here as long
