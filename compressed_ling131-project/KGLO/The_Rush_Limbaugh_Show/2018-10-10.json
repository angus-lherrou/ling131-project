I went through a lot not anything overwhelming or cancel this yet but\nI think I think the only sunny day last week and without a lot of rain and the honest we all know we're not going to get in the field for a couple of weeks\nI'm In several places uh so yeah green quality is new theory though we're going to get this cold snap the next couple of days and we're going to go back more moderate temperature um\nWe know that our brain will start out the black layer and so when we do get around to combining harvesting\nAh corn we really want to think about and and I know this is like a broken record for people hearing this from this year right when we want to prioritize and feel based on the brain all the while right we want to get out there getting harvest it\nGet it right down as quickly
