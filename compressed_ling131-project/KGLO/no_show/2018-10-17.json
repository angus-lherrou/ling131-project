I think he's he's a pretty good handle on that they can you can never get it right just because how unpredictable those um but he uh does a number out there and it's usually pretty close and and we trust him to do that and if we were going to make adjustments we certainly do but it's a it's an ... number or a a bunch of that and that really doesn't get much debated discussion\nOn the street cruise I think the last ... especially the last couple of years have done an outstanding job in the community when we've had the heavy snowfall run or even if we haven't had they had this really heavy snowfall event or you talk about the whole thing I think he's got a\nThings are pretty much a controlled was the right right down to the way it needs to be\nAbsolutely yeah he uh he does a fantastic job whether it's with the snow events or um we saw some some some wind events that came through where we ... down with it is a great job good knack cleaned up a real quick\nAnd then obviously with with the flooding the the summer with the large I had to pick up they did a lot of time a lot of resources to get into that I just picked up from the curb side from people's home so um he's um he's along tender department head it's it's a well oiled machine out there and he said it's it's under some great leadership so we're very fortunate they're\nTalking about flooding stuff I Know it was we were talking about before it went off the air the listening posts that you were actors well those are the other at my ... and er which word was at any second word so second word council members there as well when the mayor it sounds like and that was held at the end of last month I remember right and\nA flooding was one of the issues obviously with this kind of had come up some heavy rain events as well we've had heavy rain events as well a sense that listening post result but the flooding was one of the major issues that was talked about in that listening post\nFlooding dominant that listening post it really did um we had a lot of good comments on on some other items but\nA huge majority of the comments that we took in a night were with regarding British flooding issues I'm against city that it is aware of of really all the impacted areas in town and it always takes time to get to look at what's causing it and get a fix in place but\nThere was a lot of good concerns brought forward a in that parts of Mason city in those neighborhoods that\nThat ... we had good discussion um we had a good participation and there was probably forty to fifty people there that I mean they brought all of their concerns which is what we're that we're asking them to do during his listening post so we\nTook some throw notes I'm astronaut could make it to the administration I think he was out of town at a conference I'm so weak a compound that ... ... email and he's revealed staff not disciplining dishes but every every topic that was brought up that night\nI'm so staff is looking at it and we're hoping to to get the flooding issues taking care of in that neighborhood as well as everything else that was brought up that night\nWhen the weather's specific issues or just you know some common themes that where people were addressing amount of teams\nWere um there's concern with runoff coming I'm from that field on a north pairs up around between eight hundred and twelve hundred blockers or a field to the to the west appears avenue that is causing some run off his shoes\nAnd then um some some drainage issues on the streets I'm heavy rain event where we've seen several them in the past few months\nThe trains don't work as quick as it they probably shouldn't it causes street flooding and\nIn safety issues on their concerns with water sitting on the street and getting a little mafia build up by the city bus stop which causes probably be a safety hazard for for passengers loading unloading on the bottom so I'm getting a lot of stuff that maybe we're not aware of\nJust every day it is their everyday impact in the neighborhood for those people but if we're just driving through the neighborhood or city staffs out there\nI'm driving through on the way to work side or whatever they may not recognize those fields so again it's it's really great having the ... neighborhood of and then come listening post participating in sharing those concerns that we can we can take a look at them\nTell them you know the thing that I've been to offer them through the past\nYeah that that's the good thing that's a great opportunity for people to come and not necessarily want to one but ah obviously it's it's a it's a great venue for people to hate to say spot off but that's the the word that comes to my mind because a lot of time they do spot on person's job those concerns are back to you really can't do in the normal councils that\nA just a couple of other things out of you know from the last ... last night's meeting and I know a one thing from the uh the previous a meeting was that the only overlay of allowing for cross stock trucking in a\n... last year that was brought up or in the recent past it was brought up and didn't seem very favorable but the council a little bit more favorable about that now it seems like ...\nThere was a little bit of changes from last year this year that that's even miss you know took care of 'em last year it was just one structure that one of the condition to use permit to to transition to that it wasn't going to be a\nA permanent structure is going to be more of a a mobile trailer where I just had a door on each side where they could load and unload goods from one side of the other now is required to be a permanent structure in that area if they um if they choose to do that\nWhich helps with the uh the aesthetics of the area down there a makes a little more attractive or something definitely need to go now to right now in the middle a Roseville area south of town by the avenue we need to to try and person development down there so hopefully this is the first step and we can we can start seeing some things pop up down there and ...\nLast night's meeting the council approved a management zone hunted I Know chief Brinkley has been working hard and trying to figure out where exactly you got some of that hunting should take place and get that all set up so that will be coming up pretty soon where people will be able to try to help by looking at some of the population that are\nAround the community that seems like they've gotten so domesticated that are standing on the side of the road watching the traffic over right yeah I think she said there's a hundred and thirty six or so tanks hundred thirty five hundred four hundred veterans\nYeah I'm so usually starts right around the ... members will still two or three weeks out from there so any hundreds in town are interested in in hunting deer in side city limits with a few designated areas they can they can go about that\nI contact the police department here in town for more information or you have good program that you're right there's there's deer all over town really and hopefully this will\nWill do a little bit too um doesn't hurt a little bit Libya death ... she's done a great job uh obviously public safety is still the number one priority with with the adventure certainly and he's done a a good job working through that finding areas that that are going to work in ... in this project\nAnd I know he's got a couple of other areas that are might be looked at in the future as well but they just couldn't get the approval law in certain circumstances but uh yeah it's it's it's being something worked on it and a lot of people\nComplained about dear being Iran now to say um I Would seem like I Would drive by on twelfth street or at least a nearby the water plants and with a little wooded area between there and uh where the oldies restaurant areas and whatnot and it seems likely to\nStand on the road watching the cars was by and this is the I think is the fourth year we've done is\nThat the the hardest amount attack has been harvested have gradually increased each year so we're seeing some success in and hopefully that continues I'm\nAt the council got an update last an invasion or the ... initiative and uh one of the things that you know was talking about you know by the ... a couple of questions asked run by the capitals about housing and obviously a\nI had something that's being addressed all throughout our the region where there's a certain sector of housing that we definitely have a shortage of like you know the humidity yeah try\n... from our economic quarter development said it's it's definitely helped him between about a hundred and twenty five thousand a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars single family homes so and it's something that councils identified\nIn this last school session for gentleman for two years ago my for the first one I went through or not I'm constantly actually brought it up that helping mid medium range priced housing is concerned you know something we're seeing across the state across the country so something we need to can you focus on because I mean we're reminded all the time that it was roughly around eight hundred jobs\nTo the north Iowa that are available now unemployment rate is is that pretty much record low rates\nI'm so we need to figure out a way to attract those those folks here and there is not affordable quality housing in in that price range we're going to struggle and continue to struggle with it so funny I did the issues that division north Iowa a process of identified\nHybrid effort between a city clearly county\nUh everybody involved here and hopefully we can we can work towards solving that in attracting

O. P. E. or is it rained out of work\nGradual you know the gradual a noise that you hear every day you know even though that the damage might not occur immediately um but it will occur overtime so good example that you know you're out at a shooting range than you I'm\nA fire a gun from ... from a shotgun it fairly close range you know you can have damaged immediately but yet working around machinery or the larger Clinton it you know you don't notice it overnight but a bench surely it's going to catch up with you on it and cause damage so that that's where a lot of the serious risks that hurt me\nYeah very very true um something that you you don't think about the some of the damage could happen after the fact is well not just immediately right their\nWater and some things we could do to protect ourselves I mean you know your plug your mom's side of the things like that would be good water some maybe some tricks you can share Janet\nOkay well why don't we really teach with our youth and important with adult but we were recently with um University of Michigan and dangerous festival to develop a hearing the chapter for\nOur progress and agriculture safety days and three main tips that we talked to argue about and again\nSame for adults in with noisy three key things that you need to do is protect your ears like you just said wearing ear plug your mouth that are very important if you're not going to do that\nThe second thing you can do is walk away from the noise get away from that noise and the third thing is to turn it down um by lowering the solar around you know listening a lot of kids now with the air but listening to their music you know makes you ... you know lowering it down to um\nTo an appropriate level a TV turn it down um or you know like I just got back to say that if you care if he can't control it walk away or or distance yourself from the noise I did not going to really help you\nUm later on in life and a lot of that you you know some of the damage that because our thousand specially I think we're going to see it I'm In ...\nThing at that young people get older it in some of these that noise level not necessarily at the farm but by by the music that they're listening to their their ear bud so we really want to educate them early and so that they can they can make a difference later on in life\nYeah and Janet I Would think too you know the good thing especially this time of year to maybe stop and think about some of those um\nYou know pieces of equipment or other things that are round that we encounter on day to day basis and we may be you know subjecting our ears to harm by being around it all the time might be a good idea to stop and think about that wouldn't it\nIt really is and there there's so many little tricks that you could do to really identify what the damage could be on the air surrounding so\nOn our smartphones there are so many ... that are most of the time of free download and you can download the app\nAnd then if you want to you know I'm ... the noises that you're around it I think it'd be a day to day the way the equipment you're around on the machinery\nOr the music you're listening to um even you know we did that you know in our kitchen are blender and are and I think on the help I vacuum cleaner a lot of things that we lost our you know and so you can actually test that\nNoise level um through these leaders and right on your smartphone so I don't think they have to go out and buy anything real high tech I mean there's definitely a noise meters out there but you can get right from your smartphone and that we get an idea of what\nWhat you're around on a day to day basis so that's definitely something something to do the important month to do that because it is I'm a\nNational protect your hearing month by the national safety council so yeah that's a good time to just stop and reflect we should protect our here's all the time but this is a good month to think about it\nVery true want to know of course a hearing safety is one of the many topics that are covered they really have progressed very voltage safety day\nTrying to educate our youth on some of the different things that they need to be safe about and be aware of when there are on the farm in just a round round machinery and other things in general and I know of course I think you'd have to take place for all the or do\nThey do they do and we have a lot coming up actually I think that we have oh at least a dozen or more on taking place all over North America are\nTrainings have now started this week for 'em to train our safety coordinator but the two thousand Nineteen season start um this week up in Manitoba, Canada\nAnd they will go all throughout February um and that will we have I think I think thirty five different locations that will be training our coordinators out so that this is a busy time for us so yeah are they season on it it's in full swing right now around the harvest time\nIt's a lot of our faith days as well as spring time and then we're going to start slowing down until we pick up a for the two thousand Nineteen season but\nThere's so many days I'm all around I guess at North America it's easy to locate that you do on our website which is progressive at dot org\nAnd you'll see a link to the topic is two thousand Eighteenth eight days simply click on those and you can see what they think they're taking place in your local community or your home eight\nAnd if you don't even want 'em that's near you\nGive us a call because maybe we can help you in coordinating a local

announced that faith trust her\n[laughter] than we can actually and that will have are like that and a nine percent of the benefit and after that\n... kind of where I'm going to happen when it comes time for your retirement\nYeah I mean they can be broke and a lot of pension funds of going broke and the problem is you don't own anything you're just depending on the stream of payments so that you that she had another reason to take the lump sum and almost all ways and you can you can uh get with a financial advisor get with one of our smart Mr pros and run the actual calculations which are\nBut they're they're about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay but basically you can put in the amount of payments you would receive and put it in an average death age of uh Seventy six for my Seventy eight for a female\nIs that's how they are calculated typically all actuarial tables\nAnd uh then you figure out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and\nThat's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the interest rate and it's probably six percent five and a half percent something like that so I could probably make five and a half percent on your money and if you die you lose it\nWhen you die or not if you when you die you lose\nNow so if you took the lump sum you'd\nBe making ten twelve percent on your money if you invested into mutual funds and when you die your family get some money right so the lump sum Ninety nine percent of the time comes out better especially if you include the fact that when you die you get to get money you know but I Do\nKnow wow it I mean fortunately it's not a lot more than a lot you know but I Would I Would\nJust saying that it's a mathematical theory on that you run through on whether the whether it's a hundred thousand or a million or or ten thousand you know the theory is still the same\nIt's just it's an it's less important if it's a small amount of money right I get that but in other words the mistake is not going to ruin your life you know that kind of a thing but if you want to run the actual numbers out that's how you would do it and uh I think you'll find that you'll be better off to take the lump sum and roll it into\nThe growth stocks mutual funds in a good you know uh\nYou know in a good idea

debt credit card car I'm a few other debts and the only thing that we have a\nStudent loan debt ... our home and so we ... we were told my wife and I we oh about a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars in student loan debt [noise] um so we're just trying to figure out what we can do between the upgrade of the new house\nAnd the uh the laws that we have our\nReading um get that paid off with a shot I just figure out how to do with\nUh spend less than you make and put it on a student loan I mean what are you thinking about I don't understand\n[laughter] well we're just we're just trying to figure out like there's three of them between us I'm a teacher I Know that there are long forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nA loan for programs don't work for ten years long you don't want to be in depth in years what's your household income\nSo take home between my wife and I we in a way to make this object to seven thousand a year\nOkay and how much is your house primary\n[noise] or we haven't gotten our first one we just moved um so it will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay you're right it before if that's not bad at All right and you have no other that except the student one's\nCorrect okay and so if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these it's going to take you five years so I think I think you've got to look at ways to increase your income okay you got a lot of student loans for two teachers\nOver which is where did you get your memories\nOf socio after I got my bachelor's see we we both work in a new northern Arizona university\nWow you must have put everything on there um [noise]\nYeah you ... smallest to largest the three loans pay minimum payments on the two big ones are packed the smallest one with a vengeance that way you can see that treaty fall over from your shopping if you just drop a tree and the number falls over it's no fun\nYou know so you need to be you need to feel that reward of that little one going away when that little one goes away then you can attack the next one down but you got a five year plan unless you have some income to this\nUh and it's going to be a top five years really hard and so I'm probably picking up some tutoring some coaching some something things that teachers do on the side to earn extra money Paul in like another twenty grand tutoring and\nTurn your five year plan and two and a half year plan\nAnd uh that would be preferable but\nYou're going to pay a price uh eat one way or another it's going to the price you're going to pay is going to take you a long time to get out of that and that's one price and that's a real painful price or you're going to get really intense focused and give up your life\nFor a short period of time to get rid of the doubt a lot faster and you know two two and a half years you can do that but you guys are gonna be working on twenty four seven to do that with the numbers are given me and you can do it though I think teachers do it all
