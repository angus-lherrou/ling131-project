I saw the headlight cut about your dogs were the day of the living a better they'd be happy to be able to make others happy and volunteering allows you to come up with both\nThe lady that sounds like a campaign\nWhy not campaigning but I Do really embrace this and I see it happen every day I'm you know what volunteering does for people and you know for some people that get them an opportunity to change people's lives and we do see that happening and it might be small things and\nUm it also can change in church life when they see you know the good that comes out of their volunteering and\nI make them feel satisfaction for really playing a role in someone else's life helping people who might not be able to help themselves so potty training it's just a a great way to get back to your community um develops from social skills for maybe some people that are going to college that need to get out and volunteer and\nGet some some like skills filming and getting some volunteer or not by mature but some valuable experience just for for them and the other thing that we know it's all ensuring does play a significant health benefits so um people that bonds here um have lower rates of cancer heart disease I'm\nObviously reduce health care costs are ... so a lot of lot of good things come out of it\nKind of amazing when you see those kinds of things are statistically like that that's good stuff yeah and it seems to volunteers gain as much as they do\nExactly I mean it's it's really fun for us because we talked about ... almost every day and and you hear the story so you know we help 'em or just take a few minutes today go to our website and consider one of the volunteer opportunities that are left that they're usually we have about a hundred at any given time and\nJust go to me that's an excellent care center dot com\nClick on a sign up for volunteer opportunities that the ISI have on the right side and to take the form and you know form it's important for us to to know what what are your cats in your skills and talents are basically what are your interests and it helps us really match you up I'm really well with the opportunities that are out there\nAre a lot of things you know people can do an awful lot but um so what could we say today that would encourage you to volunteer\nRight now okay I'll ask you what can you say you know I Will tell me all the time oh I heard on the radio so now we really need people to go out in ... there are a lot of volunteer nice out there and\nUm we just you know we have forty members of the ... center right now that I'm most of them have a need out there on our website\nI Would say that so I Would back up 'cause one of the things I was thinking about a with volunteering and in our area is the number of years ago the school\nDecided that they would do what groups so record or whether it's this program with that program to get the students involved in volunteering and\nI think that may not\nTotally sure right now but I think it's showing up better than it did certainly by ... and sure you'd have to go right you know you're building that is that's\nRight and just you know a good example of that is that those kids the thousand me for the high school kids out on coming day or the friday I'm from coming and doing a project that across our city and that's just really phenomenal to see\nYeah a lot of schools that are really really good so I Would say uh if we don't do it and we'll get a hold of me the way I look at the church so I don't know about one or\nTwo and I'm Glad that you mentioned they use and how important it is because really I went back and looking at our members and really twenty five percent of our members work in some casting with the youth and I thought it would be fun today to talk about\nYou know if you're someone who loved working with kids or if you don't think you are I always professed that I'm really not a kid per se and but it it really is amazing when you're there and just see how\nSomething could lie to catch up or even catch that might be a little out of a more of a challenge to be around the the small impacts that you make on their life so that we talked about some of the organizations that you are are are that benefit you need on chairs in the first time I've thought of was how so\nUm I happen to have a meeting last week but the gentleman who just started volunteering with past that and it was really kind of neat to talk to him he said this is the hardest solitaire thank you ever done that probably he gets the most benefit\nOn ... but there are other organizations to\nWrite like you know crisis intervention on October domestic violence awareness month and when there's violence in a home oftentimes that impacts children so how important it is to to have 'em that organization volunteers obviously needed to make that run on foster grandparents I'm OK touch um\nPeople from fifty plus you have to be fifty five to volunteer there but they both are older population and then if I send young people that um they you know work to a lot of an impact and growing and giving and caring and learning so I Need opportunities there\nUpfront the flower another great organization in our community service Iraq area ensuring life skills and knowledge with those young people is really important and\nI'm like the nature center I think that one um my youngest son just talked about one of the things that he went to out there and how fun it was and he still remembers\nI'm going to new ... and doing things that are so how the things they're um teach our kids about nature and the outdoors and really lasting memory so um he's all insurance for that north how youth center they are everywhere this weekend and they were at the dock shallow out at a center so\nThese guys could choose on chairs for all of the things that they do\nI think I'm the recreation department that's an after school program at Harding and Roosevelt and you know anybody who works in town and uses fake hair or needs um any place for their kids pick up where they know they're safe I mean we need volunteers to help them um with that and so that's an important one as well as Salvation Army blast\nZone after school program was talking about that before\nThe YMCA again they have programs that serve the youth and ah\nAnd love there when you go there and you'd call there and it's like\nWe're for us development healthy loving and social responsibility and and they really do fulfill that mission and then you have sports on the mentors there um I have a friend that mentored young Cal from fifth grade and she stayed in touch with her all through college so\nThe things that you know how you can impact us is really pretty

your breath conceded\nTo know your early that morning actually on rent down that road that\nYou could you comment\nWrite and I think that we all get short sighted because uh you know our main priority or focuses on today and so today our problem is is the fact that we're not making maybe as much as we were and we still do taxes and we have given the government\nAnything right and so that becomes you know almost the point to um you know a problem in in how we attack things so we acquire assets like equipment and things like that because the tax deducted ability it with\nThe government has given us an incentive to buy those things because they've allowed\nUs they have a high sexual one Seventy nine to be able to write to look things up quickly you know we have the bonus depreciation it's almost become a permanent mindset and now this new special depreciation so you know we look at that we say okay here's a\nHere's something that'll fix our problem right we we lower taxes and and now we have no problems anymore problem is is that\nYou know more often than not chemical debts and that we have payments on those things um and we're buying into typically appreciable appreciating at assets you know they typically don't go up in value just like my car out there it usually is worth more than five or ten years now that\nThey get kinda tipped a little bit for a while and it's a you know use the equipment that whole value but now we've seen that significantly drop off and so\nLike I said you know these incentives kinda points in the opposite direction of where we want our goals to go which is to be reducing debt and the building assets like land that are going to be one you know reducing our costs instead of renting you know the the land base that we a farm with\nWe are on that and so we don't you know once we have that paid off we don't have those um continual payments there and then down the road as we look at retirement\nThan we have that these assets that we can rent out that are going to provide for our retirement at that point in time so again I I think that that it's sometimes just kind of a changing that mindset that we have\nMeans so focused on the tax side of things and and worrying about not paid any more than we have to the kind of saying hey maybe there's a balance between these two and we need to not get such a short sighted that we don't see 'em you know the force for the trees\n... ... ah this time of year trying to put together corporations for folks I mean for example if there's a there's a farmer that that has a son or a lawyer or southern law or whatever the case may be to to bring that whole thing together into a corporation for them\nAnd I I think the big thing with that aids is going back to you know that we're looking at the whole big picture in that process and so you\nKnow whether it's a corporation or ... see a lot of people call call up and they say hey I'm thinking about this you know Ella see somebody told me that that's the way to go I've heard\nCorporations references that corporations are bad or you know whatever and and and so you almost got to say hey let's let's take a step back what why are you here and what are we you know what are your goals and\nIn in looking at some of these ... these because uh\nYou know it's it's just like you know going out to the field you got to know what's the right tool for what you're trying to accomplish um same thing when it comes to some of these are entities structures is ... what ... what do you need what what is your operation require and so\nYou know a lot of times we say okay who's involved in the operation you know the the L O C is on the corporations have come into play in situations where maybe it's crop insurance that we want to separate some land and um for crop insurance reasons because we have some\nYou know bottom ground those higher risk or floods a lot and so we want to separate that from our other ground so that it isn't all pulled together for a you know claim purposes um maybe it's that we are firemen with a\nYou know parent or you know a a\nBrother or sister and and it's easier to kind of form some kind of analyses partnership or corporation so that we kind of work together instead of keeping our ... our operations separate and sometimes you know it's for um some session planning it will be trying to work\nThe next generation and to make that process a little bit simpler kind of separated into different\nBaskets to say okay how are we going to move it says we need and how we going to preserve\nYou know maybe the equipment needs to move with the next generation but I Want to preserve the land because that's my retirement nest egg and so\nThose are some of the things that we I always ask questions because again it's like going to the doctor and and saying hey you know I'm not feeling too good what do you what do you got for me and if\nThey have a job or some pills you look at 'em and go what kind of questions is but uh you know so that that's what you expect out of your doctor they're going to say what are you feeling what are your symptoms you know what a ...\n... ... answer these questions before I'm just hand over prescription tea and so I think it's the same thing when it comes to that and so that's a lot of times where it's you know asking them questions and then also educating a little bit on what the benefits\nAnd stuff for some of those ... yeah you're right yeah I mean you have to know what you're dealing with because everybody's different obviously\nAnd I I think that's where we kind of pride ourselves on on getting to know our clients and working with them to understand their situation I'm obviously going back to where we started you know the biggest thing that people come to us with his concerns about taxes and uh\nSo obviously the one that is their number one priority there's some you know ... feet selection there that you can do to cannot help lower the tax liability and so we look at you know what what is going to give you the most advantages one\nFirst and foremost in my mind is liability protection we want to separate the\nFrom harassed that so that we protect those assets that we work so hard to build\nSo that's one thing that we look at with the in the selection number two is just the easy and keeping that business separate I still feel like it's very important that tend to separate the business from the personal situation a personal expenses because\nYou know so many of our people they have one account and that's where everything goes through and they take their personal living expenses out of there and I think\nYou know sometimes you get lost and how much you're spending on some of these things and you know how much it requires just to live at some point and so I kind of separating those into separate accounts that keeps I'm a real some on you know what what your personal expenditures are and how the businesses doing how it's operating so\nYou know that's another priority and then you have the tax ramifications and obviously you know there's some benefits to ah using an anti specifically you know some of the season corporations there I mean obviously\nWith all the big businesses that utilize the events of the structures that they wouldn't be doing that it didn't make sense and they have some very powerful and bright people that are helped them you know make some of those decisions so we want to utilize some of the same kind of thoughts and techniques and things like that that they use\nYou know but it's it's it's fascinating you know from the outside looking in and and how some of that that would work and\nUm and I think if a farmer is thinking about what do I do next one operation\nAnd they haven't gotten together with you guys it it is time to sit down and I know today the day it's gonna be the sun's out there thinking about our what's the next to the to the set the point where where they come on and just sit down and and kind of go through a\nKind of a question and answer session with your bags to see where they're at what's the point we're looking at like\n... I mean I I definitely recommend it I mean it doesn't mean necessarily going to get forced\nInto doing something without somebody maybe it's just the fact that he won a second opinion on what you're doing and why maybe you should consider something different um\nYou know I Know going into those um kind of cool called type of appointments or it's not a situation where I'm trying to convince every single one of them that they need to come work with us because\nNot not every relationship is going to work and so I'm feeling them just as much as they are probably feeling out me but you know I think that if you have a day\nWhich yourself a little bit just to get more information get get some answers some some questions find out if you're doing things you know the right way to get back to the doctor situation\nLatin you know fatal disease and you know we got that first opinion I I think most of us would feel like we owe it to ourselves the cat in the at least get a second opinion in most doctors probably would send us to a specialist right to\nKind of get a second opinion in some direction on a treatment course or\nHelp us with those decision and then I think it's the same when it comes to\nYou know our financial situations is that uh you know we owe it to ourselves to kind of get a few different opinions and that may be\nFrom a couple of different accounts that might be from your account and then from your attorney it may be asking your bank or what his thoughts are on some of these things and you know our other people doing this is making sense do you see it working for them\nMaybe it's your insurance guy you know that says okay I hear you know that we could do some of the stuff that might help me with my crop insurance does that make sense to you and I and I was encouraged people to reach out to their people to the kids you know I'm just one you know\nI'm One of the wheels on that are on that\nTruck is going down the road and and if you don't have for you're not going to go anywhere and so I I think it's very important that kind of involve all all of your advisors and in those\n\n\nSolution is\nGuy is just getting paid off mortgage the W\nI'm Dave\nRamsey are hosts this is your show America because it's all about you [noise] it's a free calling some say if this is worth looking for the phone numbers AAA eight to five five to to find it\nThat's AAA eight to five five two to five ... is with us from Columbus ohio ... how are you\n[noise] Hi Dave how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] same here you're kind of on a constant loop and our home my daughter called the uncle day though [laughter] um I wanted to know um [noise] we watched that a lot and ah one of the shows or someone said something about a pack of\nAnd uh at the time he laughed and I was pretty funny apparently [laughter] but I just wanted to know tend to my wife and I are worth saving up and working to\nStart our own ranch and a raise alpacas I Want to know if you knew something that I didn't and maybe uh I should change course or something\nI don't even remember what you're talking about but um I guess I can comment on our practice I was trying I think we're talking about ...\n[noise] uh I Believe that it was\nOn broke several years ago 'cause there was a new fad\nAnd a bunch of people bought him years and then there was supposed to be there's a huge demand for the meat and it was basically a bunch of crap there was no demand for him your meat\nAnd I'm pretty certain that people have said daddy amuse everywhere but I'm a you know alpacas I mean I I Know I'm not an expert on alpacas I'm not even an expert on ranches but from a business perspective I think you're entering a pretty narrow market\nEvery now\nAnd you better really no your stuff and you better really do this you can't do it just 'cause you read some article about I'll practice or making people rich does or not I mean any more than anything more than cows are making people rich cows my people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich\nBut [laughter] it's how as do other running a business um called cattle you know and then a business and when it ceases to be a business starts to be a fad um or whoever becomes a business does all of this was a fad than there you go so what is the deal what are you ... what do you get out of about ... what's the product\nThe product of the police or you can use me [noise] um you can turn into sweaters and\nSocks and so forth I'm very similar to Kashmir and the wall idiot but at least you know um and ah there you can also breed and sell them [noise] um\nAnd show them and all that um [noise] but ... it's almost completely about the fleas are in a big part of it is the tribal allergenic and stuff so [noise] uh with everybody that have allergies my my children for example have allergies um and hard ...\nHave you been in agriculture and ranching before\nNo this'll be my first venture into it um\nSo why would hand out her first venture and ranching and do it with a very narrow product line\nWell that is actually the second half of the um the first struck a starting with his goats I live uh uh my I don't have all of the expertise myself it's a a good friend of mine who does and we're gonna be working together [noise]\nAnd has made lots of money on al ...\nNot a pack a different thing but I'm the goats a faded in their native country yeah\nWell I mean it sounds like you're going into something you're inexperienced in\nAnd um I I obviously I'm going to tell you don't borrow money to do it whatever money you might put into this may go away you are you know from a business perspective you've just got a very narrow demand a product line that the general public is not aware of and um so it's not like you're\nYou know cow hides leather obviously would be a completely different thing brought more for that and um or\n[noise] wall obviously there's a broad market for that and ...\nSport but if you've studied the market and you understand who's thing um I don't want to just trust a guy who was raised in they'll pack halfway around the world and his family did that for two generations or something that's\nThat is a bad idea I mean you're in the United states and you think about it you need to understand exactly how this was going to turn in the money\nAnd how likely it is because you're talking about a business here but you can't get an armored with a hypo allergenic narrow market stuff 'cause your kids have allergies that's a good way to lose all your money\nSo you need to look at the business aspect of this where does this turn into money and how many steps does it take to turn in the money and how much money does it turn into and how likely is it's burning the money\nAnd to scare the crap out of me you're in a really narrow market a fat black market\nAnd it sounds like you've got a guy from another country who has come home and told you go to the whole package worked in another market another country and I think they're going to work in Columbus ohio I I just I don't know I'm again I'm not an expert but it's just so weird so um\nI wouldn't want to know a whole lot more about that somebody brings something in here that feels weird to me usually I found out the reason it felt where it's going to be weird\nAnd ah so you just kind of got to get down into it and go watch the problems with this what am I not seeing what am I blind spots and really study it because otherwise every dollar you're putting at risk here could be gone\nVeronica is in

me manage all before cars\n\nDoesn't change the mix it'd be a two of the cars one mechanic and through the guards with the other McKenna you've still got the same for cars and you still have to manage all four of them so it makes sense\n[noise] [noise] yeah I Do I I don't know now like you have to work I well\nI it's not connecting them because it's perfect but uh the ... the idea is this the investments that you have\nAre not owned and operated by your financial advisor you own them your advisor is just telling you what to do with what things you own and\nSo you could own mutual funds in three different mutual for different mutual funds and a half or two of them with one advisor and two of them with another advisor or you could have all four of them was one advisor in either case you're still own for mutual funds\nThe exact same for by the way\nBecause you're you should be making the decision about what are your money goes the advisor teaches you advise you but you should be making the money the decision about what your money go you're not blindly tornado or block the money go just doing it whenever you want\nYou know no that's just dangerous as cried you need to know everything about where there's money going and understand everything about it and so if that's the case then the financial advisors simply the conduit and an information source\nAnd if you don't trust the information the shores they shouldn't be your advisor\nThat's why you don't need to you need one their information aligns with your value system and what you are planning to do with your investments and then they walk you through that I have one\nAnd there's twenty five accounts with this one guy in my case and and so but the twenty five counts or mine or not his and he\nJust advisors me on whether I Want to put more and more and more than one open another one whether or not one but two of 'em together we just talk through what these funds are doing and what these investments are doing I understand what they're doing based on his advice and based on that than I make the decision of what's going to happen and when my money and that's what I Want you're doing\nAnd if you do it that way then there's no benefit whatsoever to having to financial advisors\nThe only reason you would do that is if you didn't trust one of them which means you shouldn't even have them\nAnd so that that's the idea that's what the analogy was trying to get to I guess I missed that sorry about that Sean is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Shaun how are you\nThere God how can I help my call\n'em but if you could still be numbers here will quit I'm fifty five thousand dollars in cash about forty modern rock on her\nEight six six eight four four Seventy three forty four that's eight six six eight

got about a year and a half to ... pm and am kind of creating a dollar and going through everything [noise]\nWhy am I on it's not like on our credit report and how we have no contact information\nI have no idea how to get a hold of these people thought they had and getting around and we're having them try to get to\nLeave it alone I'm afraid I came knocking on our correspondent you're\nGoing to they're going to come after your student loans are not bankrupt a ball and they're going to come find you it's just setting up they're piling up we need to find it but you don't have a single piece of information on this one\n[laughter] how might happen not marry Oregon I Am I'm Mark Anthony I'm here are financial I'm terrible I got my code and resold and I'm trying hard because it was a pie that can change I tell\nYou you know it was it you have the traits account number\n[noise] probably somewhere\nThat's I guess that's the first place you would start call trade without account number and say I don't know this was so can you tell me who sold to I can tell you that you sold again all those people when they go I notice for so can you tell me how it was sold to until they finally say oh no we own it\nAnd so forth now is this the Sallie Mae loan or a private loan\nI don't know how to sell me when I was not government ensure now you're sure yeah then why doesn't it get bankrupted with the bankruptcy\nFriday pumpkin may have happened if you\nGet out of ... it's not a matter of it's not up to the lender as to where they go bankrupt as up to you and your attorney\nSo your chapter seven should call them you should have had a matrix for your desk that you do a chapter seven\nYeah OK should ever had a matrix for your datsun listed all your debt to the best of you know I mean even if you didn't list of that it can still be bankrupted did they not put anything back home for this long at all it\nWent dead it on and on credit at at the student loan and we were under the impression Dora attorney that it you know what no matter whether we put it down or not I mean we are getting good every you know that\nIt doesn't matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that Sallie Mae's or not bankrupt ... that survived the bankruptcy if it's a private loan it's just like a personal line of credit that in order to isn't it completely was bankrupted\nOkay so do you put down chase student loans some amount on your matrix yeah I'm not worried about it it was ... it was my corrupted up your bankrupt she was discharged yeah\nOK than if someone comes up you and says what do you owe us as long as I Know that was bankrupted a there's a storm originally chase and that was what was left on the bankruptcy metrics and nobody could find people but you know it's clear it should be clear I don't know why your attorney would think that is not bankrupt it I think they must have thought it was a Sallie Mae loan\nPossibly and like I put my husband's not very organized by [noise] um I mean we can say it was a private loan out\nOut or I don't know or the or a private student loan is basically an secured one\nIt's just the one that was used for college okay you just use like a person wild ride every college has the same thing a government insured Sallie Mae alone is not bankrupt devote a lot of credit is bankrupt that we see the difference\n[noise] yeah I mean we have plenty of bear hunting and Sally treat it passed\nYeah Sally Sally survives she's a resume out broad and so you just can't get rid of our until you pay are often Victor\nBut the other stuff that is what you're saying I wouldn't worry about that right now I I don't think it's going to come up if it does come up you don't have to go back and um they're this later I filed bankruptcy Thirty years ago and there are two years later American Express came at me again\nOn a similar situation that was listed on the thing but it wasn't they didn't get notified because of the way it was lifted they don't have to be notified\nA federal law and the courts bankruptcy court federal bankruptcy court and so I just shut them bankruptcy papers and told them you know this movie account don't report on the account anymore you're not allowed to report on it because they count on longer does this mean I Can't keep reporting it as bad debt after bankruptcy on your credit bureau report\nBankruptcy is the line in the sand is drawn the chapter seven clears that now the chapter seven will stay on their credit report for ten years but the the everything that caused it stops on that date\nAnd that's the way you look at it so good question thank you for calling in I'm Sorry you guys are facing that but it sounds like you're coming out the other side that

not I have a twenty year old granddaughter she is living on her own now um she was working full time more than ... when she lived in Aurora [noise]\nBut um [noise] had to move and so she's renting a room for hours away from the Denver area\nAnd she was only able to get part time she is still making her bell she died she doesn't know about a random the I had been trying to get her into a class will at some point um and in fact she does have a car payment she's making that she's you know has room went over them she's making\nA bally's you can imagine not working you know violated part time so I the problem is that she is making it but now she just found out she has five for five with teeth in her mouth all of the cat to come out and we'll be Wellington that's out there why our\nWhy did she move away from her income right\nBecause um it was a dangerous area her house with being shot up her father's ... with blown up at ... at the house on it with a life threatening situation um she walked into the house twice in the mid ... being if people were in there and I\nGot that back when I had jobs right\nShe had a job\nAnd she ... she moved so far away that she couldn't do that job when you can move out of the hood and move into a decent area and keep the job\nWell she couldn't find a went pro in the Denver area that was within her range she felt\nYeah I Know yeah I Know fell in Denver at the very very expensive rental area and so she moved somebody offered her room over in a lot of a\nParent additional shows so she's got into a mess 'cause she overreacted and I'm jumped away from her income without an income set up on the other end and now she's dolled up up up\nShe had to have to tell you that the company she was working for a promise carry they transfer to fulltime even there oh felt when she when they had told her yeah we'll we'll give you a full time day or\nTwo we understand and so she got there and all of a sudden it without right now it's part time it will working fulltime but now it's like I Gotcha so she didn't she didn't move thinking she was happening [laughter] gotcha okay well than\nSuburb of are you asking to help her with her with a with some insulation\nOh I Would yeah I I Will help her as much as I can with her with the tuition um is there any other ideas I mean what this money at the end girl she's six job that has\nA job in a bar but you you have to let her she made the decision should she has to live with the consequences of that decision and then you want to help her as a granddaughter but at the same time as young millennials they need to start filling the weight of their decision if they make a bad decision\nMom and ground pirate grandparents should not come to help them out all the time I made one bad decision Dave my dad kicked me out the house\nAnd he said hey you want to learn from ... because he knew that's the only way that I could really become the young man that I was going to become so\nThey brought a ... I wouldn't help her as much I agree with ... she needs to get multiple jobs she left a good job I have friends in Denver I understand you're saying it's expensive but it's not that expensive to what she had to move that far away or for a good solid career path that she had going on\nYou know so until these people come in with a full time work through things you ... you know ... teaches you babysit your dog walk you do other stuff to backfill and and that'll get her where she can eat yeah and if you want to help her out what the wisdom teeth expense there's nothing wrong with that\nUm but I'm not going to go along with the idea that somewhere in this process she was forced right\nAnd she's a victim of a circumstance where she overreacted or circumstance yeah yeah and uh when you tell me that that people cannot live in Denver because the rent is high\nOn the other is a whole lot of people living in Denver approving it wrong proving yeah and um so you know you've got that ... you know she just use that as an excuse and said I'm outta here I'm going to another city\nAnd did not have her feet solid under but work three four jobs and then the other thing comes in is full time job and you can drop a couple of those and maybe you can help her with the wisdom to get them help her make to make the ... the turn their financially Ted is with us in Kansas City Hi Ted you're question for Anthony\nAnthony I'm I have two daughters they're both doing very well a scene in my case for four one K. question neither one want anything to do is get a fabulous favors givers\nUm an spenders I'm the one is making a ton of money she's a welder she's on the road she saves money great and she's starting to do the four oh one cave my question is should I advise her\nTo just go to a Edward Jones or someone or a ... one of your piece war to her work one and keep transferring now\n[noise] um do you know for work when are matching matching her as well\nAnd and I that's the question is is you get the packets she'll she her she's a welder she'll run by she could be there for three months she could be there for six months so but they do all we senator retirement pay for country and have to get into that so I guess that would be the question if they are matching it would be worth the\nRolling your over Everytime you change your job\nExactly yeah yeah that's that's exactly right up so that and then in addition to that on the side of the the two have stability peace in their letter just a Roth IRA right here with us more of us are pro and then the rat each time but you're saying she's working short statements and so she's going to end up with ten or Fifteen of these little for one maybe four one K. someday\nShe could write so should cheat each time she leaves role in to the table one she has\nYes yep yes always take your four one K. with you and do direct transfer roll over when you leave always do that but that that technically or won't each one well technically be separate account number but you can still look at the whole\nAnd we will see a high that as being predicted right down to sixty six but south west wins that eight to ... genes that I couldn't see clouds maybe some scattered showers legal forty eight wins out of the south west or ten to Fifteen once you get early morning shower otherwise probably money for the majority of ... sixty three ... south west winds at Fifteen or twenty\nScattered showers late friday night to the wind blows a clear for most of your body ... thirty semi ... tend to Fifteen scattered showers you only got ... mostly comedy with live forty one Saturday Sunday Monday and Tuesday but I Am fifty Sunday in fifty six funding and back to fifty on Tuesday\nPublic out while they're comes you're white shortly before twelve thirty here on cagey alone\nIn the news this do now or a Texas vantage data after utility task vehicle accidents than rock falls on Wednesday the Sacramento County sheriff climate so they recalled shortly before it's both forty ... get him to a single vehicle you TV act in the ... block of riverside drive\nOn arrival deputies located ...
