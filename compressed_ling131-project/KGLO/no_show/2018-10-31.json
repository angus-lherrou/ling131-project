troubles we're going to continue as long as you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right exactly and I assume you've got health insurance\nI Do so when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket cost\nBetween two and six thousand dollars\nPer yeah okay and what is your household income\nOr about sixteen sixty three I think I'd like\nYou know any of your budget twelve thousand a year for medical out out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card that were that we we we paid off twenty five thousand wait till I'm about thirty laps or or making headway but you know the the hospital bills are going up but the thing\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look less when this medical battle and not expect huge\nHeadway until you do\nYeah because you take sixty thousand amount of twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too I'm\nA you're not going to make mega mega headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem but if you can stay even not going to hold or an or make some progress wow you solve this bigger issue then as soon as that's gone um\nYou know you're going to be a new man in so many ways\nRight so I mean I\nI just cannot see this being something that you go out twice a year I have a kidney stone for the next forty years I I just that that just is not a that's not tenable scenario to me so I think something is figure it out here along the way\nIn the process I I just can't um at maybe there are people that do that I don't know I've never heard of that but that doesn't mean that doesn't exist I'm not a medical professional by any stretch\nSo um but ... let's say that it takes two years to solve this and you know that's twenty four thousand dollars out of pocket that's\nComing up you know well that's just going to be that's what you're fighting you know you've just got this thing they're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and much less when the battle that you're fighting and that's the the battle for your health\nTo get your health back oh bless you sir wow ouch\nA rough is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi Brooke how are you\nOff but I I Am [laughter]\nI was actually calling on only you know our war it a lot to go\nOn I had to cross over the last fall on the roll call aspect that will hold for a while and all that changed my opinion like\nA lot more on grant that probably won't get out of them are kept on going on and tell\nMom homework at market off you know well yeah but yeah a power long time to ... twenty four I'm tired of all the small town and go out like No Child wants more older the older I get\nA little long law school but I Know\nWell the first thing you do is you budget obviously your time for your classes\nAnd then you budget your time for your study around her classes and and then you budget work I'm social comes after that I'm most people if they throw a brick through their television\nThey found about thirty hours a week\nAnd um that's pretty amazing right there\nI mean people ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore\nAnd I'm not mad about television with like the devil is on there although he probably is having a pretty good time there but um it's not like it's something like that is not what a spiritual thing it's just a matter of what do I want to spend my time on that gives me my best life\nOh it's been my time on grandbabies children wife\nMe work reading these are the long time before I spend my time so just being intentional with your time you'll be amazed at how much time you know how many have you been made so many people spend two hours a day on Facebook\nAnd they talk about a colossal freaking waste of time there's one so um if you just stayed off social media completely or virtually almost completely and he turned off your TV you could make a pretty good living with that time\nThe second thing I Would do other than that as other than getting away from time oysters and budgeting my time is your best income production things at your age well in school when you need to control your time\nAre typically some kind of self employed or straight commission slash self employed idea\nIf you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right exactly and I assume you've got health insurance I Do so when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket cost\nBetween the two in six thousand dollars\nPer yeah okay and what is your household income\nOr about sixty sixty five I\nYeah and so if you budget twelve thousand a year for medical out out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card that that were that we we we paid off twenty five thousand till I was about thirty laps so we're we're making headway but you know the hospital bills are going up but the thing\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look let's win this medical battle and not expect huge headway until you do\nYeah because you take sixty thousand amount of twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too I'm\nA you're not going to make mega mega headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem but it's like if you can stay even not going to hold or and or make some progress wow you solve this bigger issue then as soon as that's gone um\nYou know you're going to be a new man in so many ways\nRight so I mean I I just cannot see this\nBeing something that you go oh twice a year I have a kidney stone for the next forty years out of out of that that just

more all all all the smoke\nAlthough on the school board you know\nWell the first thing you do is you budget obviously your time for your classes\nAnd then you budget ... time for your study around her classes and in the new budget work I'm social comes after that I'm most people if they throw a breakthrough their television\nThey found about thirty hours a week\nAnd um that's pretty amazing right there\nI mean people ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore\nAnd I'm not mad about TV hoping the devil is on there although he probably is having a pretty

the status symbol of choice\nI'm Dave Ramsey your host you jump in and we'll talk about your life your money it is a free call AAA eight to five five two to five random starch this hour in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Brenda how are you\nBetter than I deserve but a little confused ... how can I add a little [laughter] well my wife and I was a death rate for our health uh-huh and we've got a one and a half year old little boy yeah hey and we wanted to\n[laughter] to run a plan for college but before he goes to college is likely for are they going to sort of a two year mission right and I know that probably doesn't apply for the the college savings plans mhm\n[noise] we've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars were really put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on a mortgage with one way or the other will be paid off before he goes down by a couple of good a war that is something I'm trying to build up that the\nPermission and college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free accept your home in addition to the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund of three to six months of expenses\nWhen do you how much is that about ... good\nOkay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six ... saved too is that free but the house\nThree is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that six is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can\nShow what I Want to do with the money is I Would hear a market for school and the mission trip\n'cause you guys are obviously LDS right we are yeah OK cool so what what I'm going to do is say\nOut of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of an indoor five twenty nine for my one and a half year old ... good growth stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college take the other two thousand and just settled in a mutual fund a mirror name\nNo big deal just regular mutual fund in your name and you just on the file when you drop the pipe organ or file right mission trip on the fire\nBut it's just earmarked for that it's in your name your controlling the money\nAnd if everything goes as planned and he's going to do is to your mission trip and ... then that two thousand will grow into enough to help him do that the other five thousand you'll add to it periodically throughout his life so that there's enough in there for him to go to college when he comes back from mission trip\nOff the nothing that my I had not thought about whether you'd have like that\nYeah just a little bit here a little bit there and then you know here's monitor if you look up and he's twelve years old and they go hey this is a two thousand dollars not grown do enough\nTo take care of this or it's got way too much in it I might take something out of that and throw it into his college or I might take some out of it and throw it at my house\nTo ... ... went crazy and there's fifty grand well he doesn't need fifty grand\nNoted that Iran and the money's ... remember that we just wrote on the outside of the fly on a mission trip it's your money so we're just going to help him do whatever but\nI if there's more than an up and there will just do some of the house you can monitor and as you go along and not let it get out of control if it's a little short even add to it if it's a little over you can uh skim off I bet throw it at the house throw it up the house throw it at the house\nBut you're just ear marking it you're just giving it a name or unintentional name in that way that you don't have this vague\nMutual funds sitting up there and you forgot what it is she just right across the top of it that's what it's for Alexander is with us in Philadelphia Hi Alexander how are you\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up\nA question for us and my wife and I have one child and for their profits were actively trying to have another and then next year wonderful yeah thank you so the plan would be one of the baby is born\nMy wife stay home for a year to not work mhm and then potentially go back to work after that [laughter]\nSo in terms of the ... we have left who does pay off our car yesterday great which is which is a great thing yeah so where that free up their house at our student loans have forty nine thousand in student loans\nAnd between the two of us right now we're calling it a pretty good income or we're at a hundred and Seventy six anyway what she meant um she makes one of five whoa okay so that's going to be\nBut yeah what can you live on your income if she comes home up there was no student loan\nYes okay let's get rid of student loan and get ready for her to come home and live on your income and we shouldn't should we hold back more of a reserve know Arizona now [laughter] 'cause we're gonna live on their income does get down to live on it\nAnd you know personally it gets too long to under ... get to stay with your baby steps get your emergency fund done and I'm you know but if you can't live on your income and you're going to burn through savings or as a result of her coming home we got to rethink how we're doing this\nRight right I don't want to build up of savings are planning to subsidize my lifestyle with\nI Want a lifestyle down to fit my game plan\nYou need to build up that that information and college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home cooked in addition to the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund of three to six months of expenses\nWhen do you how much is in that about ... the\nGood okay well when you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with the house and saved to is that free but tiles\nThree is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is

need fifty grand\n[laughter] no he doesn't you know but and the money's ... remember that we just wrote on the outside of the wild mission trip it's your money so we're just going to help him do whatever but\nI if there's more than an up and there will just do some of the house you can monitor and as you go along and not let it get out of control if it's a little short you can add to it if it's a little over you can uh skim off I throw it at the house throw it up the house to house\nBut you're just ear marking it you're just giving it a name or unintentional named him in that way that you don't have this vague\nMutual fund sitting up there and you forgot what it is she just right across the top of it that's what it's for Alexander is whether it's in Philadelphia Hi Alexander how are you\nHow are you better than I deserve what's up a\nQuestion for us and my wife and I have one child and was profits are actively trying to have another and then next year wonderful yeah thank you so the plan would be wants to baby is born my wife would fail freer to not work mhm and then potentially go back to work after that [laughter]\nSo in terms of the ... we have left who just pay off our car yesterday great which is which is a great thing yeah so we get free up their house and our student loans have forty nine thousand in student loans\nAnd between the two of us right now we're calling it a pretty good income or we're at a hundred and Seventy six anyway what she meant um she makes one of five vote okay so that's going to be\nBut more so can you live on your income if she comes home up there was no student loan\nYes okay let's get rid of the student loan and get ready for her to come on live on your income and we shouldn't should we hold back more of a reserve know Arizona now because we're gonna live on their income 'cause I don't live on it\nAnd you know first gets too long to under the next things get them to stay with your baby steps get your emergency plan done and I'm you know but if you can't live on your income and you're going to burn through savings as a result of or coming home we got to rethink how we're doing this\nRight right I don't want to build up of savings that I plan to subsidize my lifestyle with\nRight I Want my lifestyle down to fit my game plan\nUnderstood I guess that's the good at and say the good news is once you start thinking about that why start living on your income now and then where he's up all of our income to accomplish a whole bunch of girls before by becomes\nRight like knock that student loan debt out finished emergency fund and that kind of stuff and the math works beautifully here 'cause she makes bank\nSo both of you are doing real well so well done well done very cool thanks for joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in and we'll talk about your life your money power follows me on Twitter at Dave Ramsey is smart for twenty somethings to buy a house\nFor\nMarketing by by house you're going to stay in the location for while two years or more and if you're out of debt\nAnd you have your emergency fund their blood and you have a down payment so if you're in your twenties and your your debt free and you're going to stay on the location a while and you have your emergency coming in place plus a down payment you're ready to buy a house\nNow there's no no thing that says you shouldn't buy a house in your twenties what you shouldn't do is buy a house if you're broke person\nWill people buy houses it it makes them broker\nThat's why they call a mortgage brokers broker and broke her broker\nYou buy something you can't afford that house was cursing is not a blessing and so while they go off and buying a house when you're broke Lincoln that's gonna make you rich is is the biggest stupid oxymoron that this culture is ever sold a bill of goods to people everybody smiles everybody's vials no they don't refer people shouldn't ... house\nIt's not good for your finances\nHere's the trick I happen to believe every body can choose over a period of time to no longer be appropriate\nWhile you're well people don't buy a house\nMember of people\nDo the stuff we talk about here\nAnd then you'll get your house whether you're on your twenty thirty forty fifty sixty Donald there\nKnow you don't need to go buy a house when you find extra bedroom for Sallie Mae cleaned up your student loans no you don't do that\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save
