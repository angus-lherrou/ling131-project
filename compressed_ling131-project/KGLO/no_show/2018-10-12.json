eight to five five two to five Joshua is with us from British Columbia Hi Joshua how are you\nIn an era Yes sir how can I help\nYeah I'll Try to keep the tree lined in my car on and off too hot [noise] hold on to my car broke down a at I'm just wondering\nIf it gets ... I'm just curious what if you have something in that situation I guess probably\nFive have ended up I'd actually able to support Amy always struggle I'm currently working to regret Sean jobs a lot of them ... ... I should say other one I don't make a ton of that type of area about I'm ... I'm twenty three year old ...\nAt this point I I don't really want to\nEver be in that situation because by the physical health spiritual health mental health it's all going down and said I don't want to buy a radical happening again\nYou know you're single yeah OK and when did you leave your parents from\nBoth I've been living on what happened as a that Iowa clear\nBut I moved a B C and once I got the vc out with a car accident mhm about money that I had ... or a live all affected by the end of that and every the rate of summer\nAnd I wasn't able to secure work into shortly maybe are later that was the shelter and now recently the shelter I extended by like it's been hard but I'm wearing his home yeah I I parked by the ocean and I don't know\nWhere where are your parents live\nOlive about three hours away but she has a boyfriend I have a name there early [noise] it's very tough\nTough\nLiving in a bar or as a way that she is right you know living in your car it's tough they don't have another bad well I mean you don't take up much space as long as you're going to be like a smaller oh so there but she went home to\nFight for sure but you know okay I got basically a shame though\n[noise] she'll it so I live in Korea for two and a half hour drive away from each other so well\nI'm sure there's\nThere's I mean there's so there's two aspects of this is the short term aspect and the long term aspect\nShort term aspect is getting out of your car getting him into some income and getting even ... you know some basic shelter and giving back getting your feet on that aspect more than an aspect too is what you're asking about which is once you get that going than what we do from there to\nEnsure that you're never back again okay so I don't want to revisit part of the conversation 'cause I'm trying to get into your brain and see how you made the decisions to do this so you use the money that was going to be used for you to have a place to study you know in a a ... in an apartment to fix your car\nSo instead of being Carlos you chose homeless\nOr so that occurred without and park so I Do I put up with a very small town so I was unable to\nFind work because it was the end of their fellow everybody was already very over so well for me I had to have a vehicle to track down to Korea will be able to secure somewhere and the two shots at the moment [laughter]\nAnd I would use the money to get a ... I wanted that transportation to get from work I guess\nThey don't have no buses drive from\nA a cheap bus ticket wouldn't have gotten here to the pleasure that you're living now um and ... by soldiers\nYou know well being was like where was he like I said I said earlier I mostly laugh\nSo part of how you got here I guess that's my point is not necessarily jobs or even financial is just bad decision making\nAnd I'm not I'm not trying to shame now that I'm just trying to say I want to analyze how you got here so we never get here again and that's what I'm trying to do with you OK\nI'm at ... and the show what we've got to do is say OK when in doubt we have a place to live so I'm the second thing that keeps coming up is there's no jobs there's no jobs there's no doubt that I don't know anything about British Columbia in terms of allergy problems now as a new job but they suck\n\nIt says a third grader yeah yeah I mean you're making any money\nAnd so I Know that if you were in Nashville would I Would tell you to do is take your last fifty dollars and go buy a leaf blower rich people are for at least you know I mean you can you can find so you can create work right I mean I have a young man knock on our door with a pressure washer and he's\n... he's pressure washing driveways and paying for his tuition to go to college and so there's work to be done that pays a whole lot more than ten hours a week as a server with bad tips in your situation\nAnd so I got to do something to create income here and it's probably some kind of self employed unpleasant thing that you do for a little while but that page really good\nI mean for a short term all heavy cleanup septic tanks with a toothbrush or if it pays good to get you some money okay 'cause right now in the short term you need money right that's what we're doing and I've done all those kinds of things are done septic tank will do what I've done everything else gets\nA ... you know cut grass and hauled trash away and shoveled stuff and I've done all that kind of stuff and and honestly you can get people doing that kind of stuff for them or\nTo pay you better than than you can make six dollars an hour or something where you know\nUh and so what happens is as you you're spending a lot of your effort trying to analyze the local job economy and get jobs suck\nAnd I'm trying to think of how we can get you working a lot like your car running\nYeah my coyotes running\nDelivered so is there\nA ...\nI think I could probably make more money serving like I have\nI mean I again I don't know British Columbia but everywhere else you deliver pizzas if we'll do that like five six seven nights a week you can make two thousand dollars a month and we can get you in an apartment\nYeah yeah ... ... as I Do I

think you're irresponsible think you might not really I think you're doing really good because you don't have any money\nI feel like at this point I haven't had hoped to be a little bit more had failed paycheck to paycheck yeah\nYeah but it there's two parts of the equation right the income side and the outside and you know have you noticed that didn't even ask you about the I'll go side near case yeah and that's because I think you're probably doing pretty good there\nReally aren't we should have babies got number you're down in about six months\nAnd I think you're ... or anything you think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think you're spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nSaid yeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys puts it gives the better than I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on the back porch and talk and say\nWell we got to make some more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything is because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollar job and they're not stretch it and then we've got to look at something what are we going to do to create some additional income short short term and long term\nWe did last night and I actually got a job in the local library and after I pay for childcare only bring home about thirty or forty dollars a day [laughter]\nSo that's that's not that's not the answer the Enron\nAnd we got to have better a better income coming in to afford childcare if you're going to be working and he's got to have a game plan and I don't know whether he opened his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous picture in the world doing it on TV\nI don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you cannot be a budget by\nUh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where do you are right now\nIs that sense yeah\nAnd so I I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this thing or did he just fall into this cause your parents were doing it or\nYou know that's kind of exactly what happened\nYou know and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out and start over eraser life on the white borders second and say gosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that today and walk in and throw you know throw your life down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere where we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way\nIt is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed\nAgreed okay I think you ask them do it you're good people this is not a it's not a character issue and it's not a a
