you\nWe do jam I'll tell you what are we have a great self where you're going on here we have one huge can't fishy things for hope parking lot out here jam packed full of great merchandise anywhere from fifty percent to Seventy five percent off out there on some great items I mean we got men's women's kids\nColombian winter jackets out their fifty percent off right now I'm selling a lot of them we have a lot left yet though so come out and when does it get cold is you know when you walk out during this morning here it is a little bit of a white stuff floating across the highway and when I was coming in this morning so\nBut uh you know I'll tell you what we got some great deals out there for you when you're in a market for a pair of shoes we got 'em out there for a great great prices and um get every high school chlorine in college holding out there as well get sweatshirts for ten dollars out there for high school and college sweatshirts ten bucks\nWe got high school or anything you want for high school we got out their T shirts long sleeved T shirt sweatshirts like I mentioned hooded sweatshirt sweat pants\nWe got all their ... anywhere from fifty to Seventy five percent off right now wants to be a lot of clearance rack soccer starting as little as three dollars on some great items out there so\nAnd you went from three to five dollars and most of those are Clarence racks out there since ... out there\nGreat items for you to come out and check things out a lot of people have mentioned they're buying for Christmas already so there's little plug and therefore it gets them feels a lot of getting good you know but yes that failed to an end on Sunday jumps five o'clock Sunday fail and\nSo I always want to get the word out that uh you know last last chance to come out and get some great great items at fifty to Seventy five percent off it guy for sports\nYeah you guys are like do a bad so it's very buys longer everybody's so you'd be you'd rather go to some fine and home and north Iowa as opposed to back it up and bringing it back inside\nThat's absolutely correct yeah that's absolutely correct now the times my exports of yourself some great bargains people are bringing things in my arms fall so uh you got to come out here and checkers I got some great bargain\nA you know and a younger guy did it because like I said we ... very high school clothing out there to you know we got some Nike or Adidas ... holding out there we got some Sophie clothing out there for women so and I said like I said before the Columbia jackets out their fifty percent off men's women's and kids\nIt 'cause you you take in assume that these are going to be just like it's been in the past um another big thing that we've talked a lot about is this one Ninety nine eighty direction and we still continue to get more clarification on\nYou know what is going to be the qualified income what what what are all the incomes you know we we assume that you know our grain sales and stuff like that is what's going to count towards that but you know with the change in appreciation that's been another\nUm deal that's kinda thrown a little bit of a curve ball into it for us um you know so we talked appreciation wise in the past you know you you got to combine that's worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and you traded in on a on a newer combine and uh you know it costs\nTo fifty so that my out of pocket differences a hundred thousand we used to always say OK to boot prices a hundred thousand that's what we're going to appreciate and now\nI'm with a new appreciation scenario is treated as if it's a sale and approach it so I sold my mom combine to the dealership for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and uh I purchased a new one for two hundred and fifty thousand so that create some complications\nIn of itself and how that depreciation is going to work I mean I've got a Salem one fifty and they're probably have written that'll come mind off\nAnd now I've got this new one for two fifty will fortunately for the short term here we're able to write off for a hundred percent of that and so those things have a way of connecting themselves up to the same kind of situation as we had in the past however\nYou know how is that going to be treated when it comes to the income that's qualified income for the one Ninety nine a\nWell I'm you know fortunately it looks like the the guidance that we've gotten so far is that the sale of the ... mine is going to be considered qualified\nUm income which goes towards the twenty percent deduction that we've all kinds of men even our eye on here all summer since they are so they get this passed but uh you know one area that they uh they kind of came out with some guidance it probably wasn't as pleasing to us is\nNow I take that combine them let's say it was a hundred and fifty thousand is my ... you know what I purchased it for and the dealerships gonna offer me a hundred and Seventy five thousand for trade in against this new one so I'm kind of looking at a profit of twenty five thousand versus what gave for it well there's\nAdditional twenty five thousand is a capital gains\nDifferent type of a taxable gain on your tax return and and the Arabs as kind of come out saying that that isn't going to qualify as as\nUm income for the one Ninety nine a deduction so you know that's something that as we can continue to get the guidance I mean none of the stuff is set in stone so it's kind of a period for\nYou know tax payers for practitioners for everybody to kind of give their thoughts\nThe IRS and and probably try and put their arms maybe to see in our way and so then somewhere in Britain kind of in limbo period right now you know they they come out with the rules weekend the critique the rules that hopefully you know we have kind of a meat in the middle type of situation so that the benefits everybody\nVery true and that's where you know sitting down and kind of leads going\nWhat you have no right now we give you an idea it might not give you the Harvard\nWhere you're at right now depending on how some of these things shake out there for ... being given what you get pretty what was that I Know we're farmer you guys do a great job ... keep it up to date\nYou know where they're at right now you're rejecting her and just knowing the different things will be there for guidance is that all that stuff that we're on the job and\nWe try to and I mean it's a situation where we try and keep that information flowing out to our clients whether it be through our Facebook page and you don't have to be a client to or like our Facebook page and get some of the information and like what we're talking about today\nBut you know we provided newsletter to our client and throws you know these are ideas out there and and provide them with the updates that are that we're getting from our services um met a lot of that I think it was the end of the year middle of the meetings that we have what are we sit down and we start to talk\nTo some planning and at that time you know one of these topics comes up it's like okay I see that you made a trade you realize that this has changed from ... region in the past\n... this is how it works and kind of taken a step by step through the process\nSo they start to understand it and it may not be the first time that you talk about it it may take you know hey can you explain that again to me or it might be you know we talked about it already this summer and now\nWe're getting in the data that fall planning at the end of the year ... playing and and we go through it again and it all starts to sink in a little bit we're talking you know it's a pretty significant changes you know let's not stuff that is just a little weak like what we've had\nIn the last several tax bill is the word no changes the rates are changes you know this deduction or changes what you know you can write off for Clinton that we're talking wholesale changes and some of these areas\nThat are are completely different than how it's been in the past\nYeah a lot of changes a lot of things to stay on top of and uh it it\nHelp with that they can reach out to you in a in a corporate farmer and get that\n... definitely and I mean it's a great time I mean what are you going to be doing when it's downpour last night I mean uh I was on my way home from the game and it was difficult to even see the roads so uh you know take advantage of some of these opportunities try and learn 'em for anybody you know out there that just they say you\nKnow it's probably time and then I just uh give us a chance or talk to somebody corporate farmers you know what they might be able to do for us or what services they provide\nGive

that's AAA eight to five ... five two to five Tyler starts off this hour\nIn Honolulu Hi Tyler how are you are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nOh I'm In the army I'm a Nineteen year old and I'm looking at why they weren't critical time to go home and I was wondering strike ... aren't able to go oh my God father was paid for face for colon cancer\nOkay um what do you make a year\nAnd that includes currently be promoted in making around twenty thousand\nOr ... yeah okay um what's it costs to go home\nI Would look it up like last week and the cheapest what I found through our nine hundred dollars\nWorth of home uh Ocala, Florida who they jump from a ... okay oh yeah I'm military doesn't have any way you can hop a rod no\nThey haven't stopped being a program like that but it's hard to get our current that I'd be a holiday or how to get an email to their good chance that it doesn't work out and and I like that that fight like even more I'm trying to leave within three days\nYou know it'd be bother flight then you lost that money is you can't get refund\nYet you got to use the ticket you don't necessarily cashiers ticket or um well I mean it's a decision you have to make your romance a thank you for your service to the country um and actually it's a difficult decision so if you're broke\nAnd um you know you'd have to declare this one emergency to use your emergency fund\nAnd if it's a vacation and it's not a vacation but if it's a vacation than his mouth emergency right\nBut it's going to figure out if you're going to share your godfather who um you know has um then given a horrible diagnosis you in in your mind and your closeness with him and so forth and it's an emergency\nOr if you're using that to rationalize going homeless and your mommy for Christmas and don't do it right but if this is something that's you're that close to him and that means that much to you than you know yeah you would go do it probably but you're declaring an emergency and you're using almost your last dime\nOkay so it's a really it's really you're really cutting down the wires got to be a big deal to do this and sounded like it is a big deal but you got to really put it in that category it's not the medium deal category and it's not the sort of kind of odd like to go home and I'm usually such an excuse category it's got to be\nThis was something I regret the rest of my life because this man means so much to me and so on and so on be on it got a big big deal category you see what I'm Talking about\nIt or the other day I lost my father patriotic character arc is the author diagnosed with cancer and go out there\nIt's hard to see anyone get diagnosed with cancer but whether you make this trip is dependent not upon the diagnosis but upon your relationship to this person\nAnd does it you know if you're very very close to this person that's fine if you met them once when you were a story and uh then there are declared your godfather then you're using this as an excuse to go home you should let\nThe person that rate because my father passed away okay\nNow now so that's why that's the difference that's what I'm Talking about so that's the that's the way I'm thinking through this as you know what level of emergency is this because you're you're ... you're using your last freaking dime oh and by the way between now and Christmas making twenty grand living on base I don't know where your money's going you ought to be saving much\nYes um I I just started a program I got a bit like I got up and I said\nThis was October okay so I mean you've got October November and December ... check to work with and you really don't have anything to do with money because your your your food and your clothing your housing as first yeah she'll stay over already and put all your money in the account\nYeah a complete stop after all that but I didn't go to wherever out four hundred dollar paycheck taken around by\nBy time I'll able to go back I could have in my own take on your\nGovernment are they going our thinking the right way and it might encourage I've done a little bit further which country dump large you can you shouldn't have a lot of bills unless you've got some doubts about 'em because again you're using the subsidies are covered food shelter clothing\nAnd so forth and your situation so thank you for serving your country sir and I hope this works out for you appreciate the call Jeremy with us in Roanoke, Virginia Hi Jeremy welcome to the Ramsey show\nThe fact that can Michael German what's up [noise] a couple of years back or if they've been heritage or some of the other mutual funds and somebody will stop\nA roughly now it's twelve thousand the mutual funds and about five thousand a stock\nMarket are on baby step number two we got twenty four thousand dollars in student was my question is should act cash out that all of it a mutual funds and all that and just out on the desk and I have all your all of the stock Rachel French\nOkay am I going to have significant tax when it comes back out of not going to be on a an inherited I alright\nI Do believe that they could they said it was a single a counter or something I'm not sure\nIf it's just a simple stock account of simple mutual fund to count your basis for tax purposes as what it was worth when you inherited it you will only pay taxes on what has gone up since you got the money\nA cafe roughly four thousand dollar as what it is going up and fired okay\nAnd so you might have a thousand dollars in taxes or something like that that'd be the most so you know if you catch it out you know ... have them look at the what's called the basis your basis as your market value at the time of inheritance\nAnd the change in basis from that time what it was worth a ton of even heard of it up to now is what is taxable\nAnd so there is zero zero tax on anything that you inherited at the time so that that's the deal but thanks for the call my approach it touched checking facts guy and I've set aside a thousand bucks but yes we cash out everything that has not retirement\nAnd use it on a beach up too\nBecause we're getting out of that show that we

I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they reported it yeah like all of this out and he would wait Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving\nThen but I think it absolutely outrageous [laughter]\nAh yeah any role so negative equity into that to get on and so that the forty five thousand is that if it was a guy that was settled for pennies on the dollar you can probably tell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do with that I\nWas in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm wow a\nYou might be able to settle those would lump sum I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you're going away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm Talking about it or not thirty dollars and so you know you've got to put some money together here and that means bugs that you're going to get your incomes up and you both have to have like I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you guys just go bananas it's going to take a few years\nSo I'm\nNot that's what you're facing and ah but the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you is that what you wanted that your life but I don't tell people to not get married over that\nI Do tell them to not to get married over the decision to stay in that when you don't want to stay in that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not gonna last\nIt's it's it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nWhat you're going to get divorced I mean that's it's a fairly simple equation here and so you have to be in agreement so I don't think fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not keeper I don't know if he's a keeper or not I can't tell you sure it has a bad taste in lawyers\nI Know that but because he got his ...\nBut um anyway man he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer was her Seventy grand and half of his income [laughter]\nIt's it's not for the\nGood

why don't you pick at twenty fifth and down and we have about half of that now but we only that land of the company I mean if you're able to shake their land to add the down payment\nAnd Iran is like the top fifty thousand and one thing I did I get put in addition on ten pounds and I can make it twenty fan I'm I'm Wondering\nHow much do you have to put down in cat and my mom about thirty okay and that's ... that's set aside for your down payment on your house\nAnd yet we have our and they can find and that leads to weight lifting Anthony packaging everything down all we are only about like a car um and it out there and a half a credit card ... do you own a home now\nNo okay um\nFirst thing I Would do is I Would not buy a home until I was free and then my merchants who phoned in place\nSo that means you need to write a check today and pay off your car in your credit card and cut up your stupid credit card [laughter] okay okay now your debt free right yeah okay and that was foreign to\nI so six thousand so I'm Down to twenty four thousand right okay and your land that has paid off and it's worth sixty\nAbout the about fifty and uh we need sixty so you need ten thousand that's where you're getting your twenty percent I see what you're doing okay ah well working fourteen thousand in the emergency fund\nTo pay so now you have an argument for about ten thousand with the land\nYou get a construction law and take out while I'm up I'm going to take out\nAnd you're much cannot exceed or a three hundred thousand dollar value that does not mean a house that you spend three hundred thousand on the house okay the value of the total package can't be more than three hundred\nDoes that make sense huh so that means you're building up two hundred and forty thousand dollar house maximum\nOh okay\nBecause the packages worth three hundred and that gives you the twenty percent down if you spend three hundred on the house now you're at three sixty and you don't have twenty percent down anymore\nOkay you see how that works\nSo you're going to have trucks and a lot of them that is tied to your new mortgage that is your final mortgage good called your permanent mortgage that's the mortgage that takes out your construction on them and so you're construction lender will require a take out letter\nWhere you're for or your permanent mortgages already approved sometimes you get a package all that together and with increasing interest rates are probably would package it altogether checked Churchill mortgage they could probably help you with that and you walk in your interest rate on your permanent mortgage\nBecause these are more different writer ticking up and I did a lock 'em in and when you can by the way if you'd have a ... and you've got a higher interest rate loans folks the answer would be the time to call Churchill mortgage a it is taking up\nAnd I would lock in rates if you're in the middle of a deal right now walk your rights and\nAnd I probably would lock 'em in like twenty minutes ago like four days ago I Would look for but we are in a rising interest rate environment nothing to panic about whether there's going up\nAnd so you might as well take advantage of the lowest possible right you can get your hands on for refinance were for buying or in her case for building and um\nThat's my walking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see rights come back down dramatically um you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next six to twelve months they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's very easy to look at the trends um then then I'm going to walk everything in as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage the bank and get this done Barbara is weather's barbarism Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nGetting gray area there are better than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away on ... and I'm a big effect
