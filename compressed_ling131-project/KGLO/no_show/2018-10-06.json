eighty a little bad then you've got to go south and uh\nJust seems like it takes a while to get better than when you hit the Indian all you gotta kinda drive through a little bit of bowed out towards ... and all it provides a\nLot I don't know what it takes a little bit longer and one trap it gets back up you know we get down there about rush hour ... even the mouth of the things like that when they go down\nIn one of those back and forth things early all and I thought they\nCould have maybe broke bringing got something going early that might have changed his little yeah we came out and had a lot of after\nWe gotta stop essentially I'm One of us backed\nOff actually ran a kind of a little trick play a little bit past player and um it was on your show on and I don't know if I was able to do with their hands up and kind of make a little bit a plant there but that just a little bit further and everything\n[noise] to move out of the game and had a lot of momentum and even with that mess our kids are playing um I think a number of fans at old I'm I'm a law against some or all year the first half dozen\nHitting the action that I was but it looked like there are some pretty good contact\nYeah that was very physical I'm drawing a line did a great job I'm off ...\nGuys out there and and Bush and guys but ah they add pressure on their quarterback a coach and then decided to dial up a lot more blue against it you know I'm not that\nDefinitely paid off you know I don't gambling and traffic can be defensive coaches doing a great job scout and you know Ron versus bad situation um coach candidate a great job of turned on our guys are when I came to those patches wages are getting pressure on that are cute he definitely cut them off\nEven in the ... century orders\nKinda got away at the end but it was it was one of those games where you're up against another\nTen ranked team but they were on the pay that they all are undefeated team that a lot of good quality changes your\nSchedule then are definitely loaded with a lot of the top teams and for a football this year\nI don't think that necessarily something to look away at home or um even foot down or or uh you know making excuses for a house or non success but when you think about the change that we played it just shows that are preparation has to be that much better knowing that we played such competition and we\nCan't really control the guys on the way up breaks out but we can definitely into our preparation and you know just getting ready for a knowing that we play with a top teams we just have to continue to work and vital and I was actually a won't be able to be a lot better when someone will top teams\nOut this week you're up against it saying that\nThere was a couple of all games but I'm probably haven't quite the competition yeah\nYeah when you compare to schedule they definitely had some games that they are able to compete in a lot easier than some of our games but\nUh [noise] just another one of those games that we feel like they match up very well with their off on the line of defense of line is roughly about the same size as our guys just watch them on film I think our guys will be more physical and unable to get after it and\nAll that they've got to go with guys that are secondary to have to really try to lock down because that are really good at doing double movies but again if we can get pressure like we did last week against any and all that he won't have time to let those guys get up and down the hill them that could be a big difference maker\nYeah you guys have to go into the pressure and\nMore of the blue light up last week yeah I definitely think that you\nCan uh wanting to do that you know I didn't know there are some areas that he wanted to get cleaned up all the blood sometimes the coverage or walking or why correctly a behind the blood and if you're going to bless you want to make sure you got your coverage is set up a bill that way if they do some kind of a hot read\nYou're able to take that out right away and not let that go for the game so uh I Know that was focused because we can practice is just making sure that those um coverage and got a\nKind of the gear behind the blood out their coach gamble probably Dallas and blood pressure on that\nGuy [noise] you know talking to vote on it [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI think it's coming along pretty good I think of a situation with Cody he's coming into first first start as a quarterback divorces level our district opener against rocky and\nThere's only one of our game I can think of as a high pressure for someone to search for as far as the game that might have been when we asked Danny ... is our and it was on the road down at Fort Dodge of all places and that that's a difficult situation and\nYou can definitely tell somebody was against walk but he's settled and it was a game on on last week you could\nTell he was a lot more comfortable and I'm really enjoy about listening to Cody a during that program was he was aware of what it is to work on and that we talk all the time and preach out all the time to look at what you can do to improve and make the team better and\nUm the way he was able to articulate that radio and talked about how he wanted to just an absolute shared histories and\nTom as you know whether the polar pitch and\nEven recognize you're going to have these fish to me that sprint software no I'm not so what's going to make him you know trying to win and be in for the Centers for the rest of the reason\nYou're talking about that and again and again the track we met at\nNight when you're in the quarter back in time to nail events crash in art and you've got to read that don't when there's an awful lot that goes through your mind\nThat the biggest thing is just happen to trust that if you're going to catch the ball and the guy who you're pitching to is where he needs to be and I think a lot of times quarterbacks will take their eye off the read or to look for that patch back but if we can\nGet ... back to be consistent on our paths and the and the right spot at the right time and we can build that trust with Cody on knowing that if he pitches and it's going to be handled correctly\nI'm just going to make them even better\nThan the one thing I didn't get a chance to talk about small pox and Jodie is how he hands of all officers that and then it becomes a Walker um he's one of the ... gene running the options when he hands off to the dial on triple some time in\nI'm walking down the field for\nAs as good as before it gets rid of it\nThey can run the ball on\nThe defensive when they do a lot of things that will allow us to possibly run the ball and I know that information wiser and transcribe them out a little bit of times and still run inside\nBut in order for three of mine that they put their linebacker five yards off the ball which is going to open up planes or give our climate change that second level and make a lot of us are there non field and [noise]\nUm [noise] you know when the two eyes safety luck but we interest rate than the state of the box or if we start roundabout consistently but we definitely have a chance to run the football and that was that ground game\nThat you know what was for Cody to build confidence and just all\nDepartments look like this way\nIf you guys are out I Believe the air's not you'll still are injured in a job the loves out ... Johnson but most of the other guys are are all back in a healthy and I'm with dog ears and overturn last week and his uh his job snapping the football and on and\nStuff where the lights out and I know I was a area we struggle in stuff done and fill that role and a man what a difference on friday what the funding and being able to the field and and helping that was told I feel possession\nAgain thanks for special teams too because you could make all those bugs for it yeah close\nAnd and also a could be kind of rainy and what I'm looking at the forecasters a chance for some rain and a special James I'm just a part of the game just like any other a game that's one of the games free can\nDefinitely maintain special teams that can maybe get some kickoff returns and I guess in front of returns get ourselves and good feel position or give her child has a chance or in deep deep sense of laying a definitely increase our\nCoach good luck on a sort of law when a free game show on ... this\n\nOut here comes the approach on the football and the left voter pops this one up\nAnd it's taken my quiz here with the Fifteen to twenty up the right side twenty five I did the thirty ... thirty five yard line they might give them the thirty six but probably thirty five and a nice\nOn a short kick so nine twenty nine romantic and the first quarter to seven in the game Mason city high on the short end of that score\nLocks will go to work they\nWere on a ...\nAd quarterback\nThey start out with Joe ... terrible at that running backs spot right in behind\nPhone booth and under center\nThey started little motion hand the ball often couldn't Terrell go straight ahead\nLeans free yard\nAnd that'll be just about it a little bit of a porch team has got some big kids on a cold is a\nYou know when you look at\nSome of the guys in the defense of friends\nWhen I was three thirty\nSome big people a\nBench since two to twenty five and he's on that end of the right side\nSecond now long eight almost nine years to go for ...
