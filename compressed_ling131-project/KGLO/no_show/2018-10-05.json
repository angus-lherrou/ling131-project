meal and get more than you expect violence here in America ... or ... or rather than we are not in the ad council history\nOften as Cincinnati files to Rio\nBy Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nWell um my wife and I we are coming up on our one year anniversary and in that amount of time they saved up about twelve thousand dollars and our cow\nAnd we have about three thousand dollar emergency fund um we have not including our house about twenty six thousand dollars in debt\nUm and my question is I don't know what we should do with that money I I'm going to school to be a nurse I'm just starting my first year um and I just I Want to know what I should do with the money should I put it towards our how should I put it towards the car or towards school and cash flow school\nOkay um well if you're working our plan not counting school will come back to that\nYou would do what we call the baby steps and the first baby step as you say the thousand dollars a as a starter emergency fund anything above that and we stop all retirement temporarily anything above that we throw at our debts not counting our house\nUsing the debt snowball and that's where you list your debts not counting your how small is the largest minimum payments on everything but the little one and attacked the little ones so that would dictate that we would throw a lot of this money at that\nThan maybe once you're out of that but the house then baby steps three years you return to the one thousand dollar can't raise it up to three to six months of expenses and then\nA a\nPast that you restart your retirement sharp putting Fifteen Percent away for retirement start saving for kids college pay off your house early as baby step six so the house is way down the list so it it's not even going to come up you're not getting to the house you know you don't have the money so then we bring in this idea of I'm going back to school to be a nurse\nIt was an awesome go or not only will you be very employ more you have the ability to make really good money and um and can really adjust your schedule and crazy ways to really double your income if you want to for short periods of time I mean you've got all kinds of options and nursing that are going to be really good for you and your family [noise] um\nSo are we the return on investment\nThe investment in to Austin is a really good investment\nBecause of your field of study you know you're not you're not getting a degree in less than a puppetry here this is my ... degree and so\nIt's worth every penny or spending on it and and a bunch more is what I'm saying so if we're if our goal is to get out of that so that we can build wealth than the first step of that before we start anything else to say no more new that\nYou can't get out of that while you're getting into that that you can get out of holding out the bottom right so that means we got a cash flow college so what's college go cost\nUh it's about three thousand dollars a semester and Andre semesters a it's probably at least three years' worth of school Rio ah years three years of school so I'm thinking\nReally well maybe so you you didn't complete your undergrad already then\nNo I mean I'm I'm a baby in in college I I'm just now starting I mean this is from after a while and I haven't you know that\nThere's no you don't happen to you don't have an undergrad under your belt that you're adding a nursing degree to ride ... okay so you got to finish up some undergrad or do some undergrad and then move into the writing so you need a three thousand a semester\nTimes three our our ... our time for three years you said is where I was going to take you and so six thousand dollars a year for three years Nineteen thousand bucks right\nYeah something like that OK okay and what's your household income\nUm it was about sixty thousand dollars and my wife were first baby next role in the beginning of November\nWhat's your household income during the next three years gonna average\nProbably around forty to forty five thousand dollars oh\nOkay so you're not going to have a lot of cash to school and you have how much in savings\nOr twelve thousand okay oh I get\nGood in that emergency on fourteen thousand\nOr your emergency fund a small you know okay yeah I think your total money make over baby steps are on hold until we get college paid for\nOkay so I Want to set the twelve thousand over in my college fund and it needs to be a team\nAs my very first call and then when it comes to Eighteen then we can talk about building the uh you know when you talk about taking the emergency fund down to a thousand and start working on the other day that's how much of that data got not counting your house\nOr the car and watched it on the court it's about twenty five thousand oh lord and you make forty five well at the time we uh we made like I said I made about sixty sixty\nFive dollars and car if you're going to be making forty five thousand this car does not fit in your goals for the next three years okay mathematical insanity\nI mean look at look at these numbers we got an Eighteen thousand dollar a you know investment into Austin which we've agreed is a really good investment we we've got three thousand dollars to our name we've got a forty five thousand our household income\nAnd twenty five thousand dollar car no I Need to hear like five thousand dollar cars when I Need to hear\nOkay in the middle of this because cars not your goal right now your goal is get all this mess cleaned up and get your education on your belt and double your income which is what's gonna happen\nOkay great yeah so in your car okay\nGet you get you a much much much cheaper car so that you hit these goals because what you're doing is you're paying a price to when you're living like no one else so that later you get to live like no one else\nBut this car as it stands out as you had to have this really logical really smart a whole thing going on until we got to the car and then we went to stupid land\nIt just it just sticks out it doesn't it doesn't fit in your equation it doesn't even fit in your life it's like you all had a you know a really bad impulse one day and you know just went off the ranch or something I don't know but even if you are right get sixty five it didn't fit it was ridiculous purchased so it's just way too high\nAnd even if you pay cash for it in all of the middle all of this so it wouldn't have made sense some time to time to move that puppy and then let's live our lives does it good news is you'd rather than you want man 'cause your income is going to be eighty\nWhen you're finished with this and you're able to pay cash and\nYou know but you can't have these blockers in your way that you're trying to get around this elephant in the room\nThat says car it it was in killing you Kevin you plant it's it's it's just it's death so anyway that's what I Would do and I think you guys are really smart and I think you'll do it open it sounds a AAA eight to five five two to five Doug is on Twitter is it normal to continually adjust my budget during the first month\n[noise]\n\n\n\nLambs

you\nDoing great thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise] the wife and I had been knocking out maybe step to subscribe you worry we paid off about fifty thousand [noise]\nAnd we've got twelve to go and I just sold a piece of equipment that I didn't need it anymore that brought up in about ten thousand additional dollars good animals there were close we're so close [laughter] we don't want him to do in the future solar panels on our home ... utility bills and a loss change in Indiana this year\nWhere it makes it basically useless to do that if we don't get it in this calendar year mhm\n[noise] the whole projects about thirty grand but if you can get your foot in the door which will cost me about ten thousand dollars [noise]\nUh your your grandfathered in for life so I can take this ten thousand [noise] get the you know the the baby system if you will started that I'm good to go for life but I'm I'm torn because it'll push my baby step to off to probably February\nSongs on the other shot in the sun up in Indiana what do you mean\nThe laws change or something called net metering out there where you make more power than you need when the sun's out your meter scale effectively turns backwards and say you're kind of putting power back in the bank roll over minutes used to be on on that night\nHe pulled back off of those ... those watch that's going to why you'll you'll save on the power you make while you're amount it you know but but you don't put anything in the bank so I mean that would return on investment scale virtually nonexistent when that happens\nFor like those how half is not enough\nIt becomes a lot less than half and right now it's about it and you're right of return\nNo that's too long anyway so I Would have something with a ten year or if I don't actually I should have practice that there's a lot of start up stuff that's in that first ten thousand [noise] and that cost the cost to go forward from there I wouldn't have to do with it and I have a five year break even [noise] so but then there are five you're right people don't even less what\nI wouldn't do it because here's the problem technology is changing so fast\nAnd the marketplace just changing so fast I mean solar panels five years ago versus over panels now it's all about ten years ago versus now\nI'm a complete little light years different in what they do and what they cost for that matter and so I'm number one let's pretend you were sitting debt free and had like a pile of cash in the bank um I personally wouldn't vote where the ... even then\nIf it was just extra money laying around and they only a five year break even I wouldn't get economically makes sense but aside from that discussion you just don't have the money\nThat's true you're in debt and or if you can get there by the end of the year you may debt free have your emergency phone in place and then by these things\nBy your starter system if you want to get in and you can do a five year break even that way but I don't think you're going to hit all of that was what your job but that's a lot yeah and so I just I I Can't tell you I I mean I I'm a fan of solar panels in general\nI'm but I'm a fan but the only way obviously I'll tell you it's by pay cash for it and I wouldn't take it out of your emergency fun to do it so doing it instead of an emergency fund\nIs the same thing sure and so I I you know I Would be inconsistent and I got you know the answer questions or what would I Do know what I Know I got to tell you but here's the thing I have like these principles in place in my life personally like I don't borrow money like we don't use emergency fund except for emergencies\nNo matter what ever\nPeriod and it has caused me to walk away from some things like that I really did want to do\nLike you really want to do this and you're going to walk away from it at least for now unless something changes or after our conversation right but you know if you do what I tell you the you're going to walk away from his cause me to do that and I kind of went off guard gosh lord what are you doing here\nAmong God show up you know you don't mean don't you like solar panels go [laughter] you know seriously and um I walked away from some stuff and then thirty six months later\nFour years later I look back and I go oh that's why I wasn't supposed to do that\nYou know that that that that we're view mirror hindsight is twenty twenty\nI mean you can tell what was going on when you look back but you don't know going forward but I Do know that want to violate the principles I always lived to regret it using the emergency plan for something other than emergencies\nAnd I I'm not done that research around them I got burned so bad and we went broke the scars were so deep the lesson was so thorough that we don't borrow money\nFor anything ever\nAnd we don't even use the emergency fund for emergency ...\nI mean much less anything else because that fund is like it's like sacred to her because of the scar that is in our lives from having gone broke she just it's been Thirty years and she still can remember the taste in her mouth that that there were\nBrought that level of fear brought and so we really we don't even use the emergency run for emergencies I mean it is you know we got a big pile of cash and for no apparent reason\nOther than it says W I share and wants to know and you know even then something comes up we just either we cash flow it or we wait a little bit because we don't even do use of merging the funds for emergencies so that's that's\nServed us so well oversaw long a period of time Jeff I think I Would be doing you a disservice to tell you to do something I wouldn't do even though I get while you're doing that's when I intellectually grasp your argument or your\nYour um your conflict in the discussion\nSo I'm not against solar panels I Want them to break even quicker and what you pay cash for a matter of fact I'm a fan of solar panels
