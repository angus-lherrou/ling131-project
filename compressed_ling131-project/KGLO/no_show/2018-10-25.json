or\nRight I think it's like anything that we discuss you know it's a team effort um it's not something that you try and\nTake on by yourself I mean you're going to need the help of your attorney obviously your your tax man I'm probably your bank your your investment guy in um insurance people there there's going to be all those people that you surround yourself with that you're going to\nCount on and I think that's part of how you can make that process a little bit easier on yourself instead to back to you know overwhelming yourself with all the work is is lean on those people that you trust\nThat take care of those things that have that special seat and you're you're more or less the quarter back you know you're you're there to take the snap into a pass the ball off to those people that are that you count on that you think can maybe pick up the first down or a catch that touchdown or any of those things or you know along the way and so\nThat's why I think that a hit on surrounding yourself with those good people whether it's a\nYou know like we talk about on the financial side or when it comes to a state planning I'm having having the people that had have been through it had those experiences and know how to handle um the problems and and things that are going to come up is a very important in that process is\nVery very true and of course um\nCorporate farmers just a phone call wave real easy to get hold of and you know thinking about you know things like state planning or we talked last couple of weeks when I've been on the show about\nYou know thinking about tax season coming up here at the end of the year uh it's all these things that like we said you can't show not thinking about really right now because we're printing the combined record and semi but if\nYou haven't started thinking about it you need\nTo but I I think that you know as people sit out in the combine it it's a great opportunity to kind of go through these things in their mind and uh you know if if I put myself in that situation I think that you know we've got all got\nProbably you know smart phones maybe maybe we have flip phones but I mean either way you can you can keep two notes in there\nAnd to me as I was kind of going down the uh the roads I Would tend to check out some of these things that need to be accomplished I mean winter is a great opportunity and that's why I think it's a time where I Try and remind\nMy clients is you're going to hit it hit a kind of dead time there as far as what you can do obviously out in the fields and\nThat's the opportunity to get all these things caught up to take care of them to deal with these things and so you know as you as you get that a seat time windshield time whatever you want to call it out in the minor tractor semi or whatever I think you know you need to process some of these things and figure out\nWhat are your goals what do you want to accomplish this winter and and uh you know when you have an opportunity obviously not when you're driving down the road in the semi do I want you to be typing notes into your cell phone but uh maybe when you're sitting there in ... in the line waiting to do\nThe rain and then would be a good opportunity then to take those notes and ah and put it into a your phone so that you know once you do kind of hit those uh bad weather days or ... you know you've got that kind of the things that you wanna get\nTaken care of you know maybe a little rain in the forecast maybe that's what they didn't start right maybe or I might be the day to pick up the phone and make the whole corporate pat her and just say hey you know I I've been hearing about ya and everything else and I think I Need a little help\nYeah and I think that's a great idea you know is is just start that whole process is make that phone call and uh you know get on the schedule and say hey you know I'm going to commit to this and I'm at least are going to see it through and I and a and\nThat doesn't mean that you're going to again complex at all in one way or or one afternoon it means that we're going to start that process take that first step and I think you know if a if you think that uh you would like to meet with us to kind of discuss how to make that work\nYou know I'd say to give us a call and and uh you know once you get done in the fields and we can start start that path with you\nDefinitely that's very simple to make that call like I said the word reach out to online there's a lot of different ways to connect with your\nGuy yeah give us a call at eight hundred for seven to six nine three one or check it out on line at a corporate farmer dot com\nAnd Facebook as well have different little tidbit posted on the other is if you want to follow along on social media that's a that's another way as well and you know such as ah it's that time of the year a Harvard busy but you you got to think about some of the other things that go along with the operation too\nAnd it definitely want to uh you know recognize that harvest is going on and they are and we're glad for our clients and farmers in the area to be able to get out there or you\nKnow obviously like everybody we recommend that you cannot be a little cautious as you come over ... hills and downstream gravel roads or you know there's a lot of traffic out there and everything and so uh you know good luck to our farmers uh hopefully they can get kind of finished up with harvest or at least get a good go at it right now and uh\nYou know we look forward to a completing fall on me

I don't think I've got like a day and like three or four years about just thinking about it and how great it would be so what's the dream car [noise] I'd say a BMW and three forty six ones though huh\nAnd how you're going to maintain that puppy because your maintenance on that's pretty serious\nYeah a tech continuing to work you know what I hear from other owners of the\nCosts about on average Fifteen hundred to two thousand I'm a year period just keep it in good shape and maintain it and you know I'm an armed thankful that my job right now I'm can pay me enough to to you know continue to fund mhm\n[noise] um\nWell you picked out a very cool car no question about it I'm way could or for sixteen years old no question so [laughter] have yellow automobile really is\nA it typically is going to be a car though by someone who has a um a really really good income and the Fifteen hundred dollars\nTo keep it running every year is a minor part of their world instead of like a hundred percent of your income you know\nIt's a Fifteen are buys a big part of your world a year it's not a hundred percent of your income but I mean it's a big part of your world is sixteen years old and a you know I'm more concerned about that owned going maintenance cost of this thing that I Am an actual purchase\n[noise] um I I did a man and I make about uh you know Eighteen thousand a year and now that really doesn't change it they are that they are\nIt doesn't change it I mean a Fifteen hundred dollar maintenance fee for you know to keep a car running and that's if everything goes pretty good you can drop five grand and it pretty quick beamer\nAnd again the car you're talking about is I used to my car it's I Wonder if in lower on my car guy I get why you'd want it the and and if you don't spend Fifteen dollars on car and you worked and saved up Fifteen thousand dollars and you do it I\nYou know I might say well might spend tan and keep five in the bank that kind of runs through my head but uh by the time from that that doesn't bother me near as much as you're signing up for\nA problem child\nAs far as that goes I mean that's what you're signing up for that bothers me so as long as you know what you're getting into and you're willing to take it on a but you may look up one day and go I Wish I didn't know this car and which time you sell the car\nOkay or don't let your dream turned into a nightmare show by it and if you like it driving a while and if it starts to be a you know a drain on the old wallet and it's more you know you're just like every time I look up I'm gonna write checks for this thing which is true of a car or a black eye you are going to write some checks\nFor you know a a car of that type no question about it and um so I mean Fifteen hundreds the average ... five thousand or you could write five hundred\n... it's not going to be Fifteen hundred it's not that's not what it's going to work out to be so be ready that's what's really going to happen uh and if it gets to be a burden around sounds stupid thing you know what I mean data that you're paying cash for it it's what's your dream was your work for it rang the bell hit the gold do it\nIf it doesn't work out Charlotte\nBut be emotionally ready to sell it if it becomes a part because I don't think that writing those maintenance checks is going to be a sponsor as easy as you're

I appreciate your spirit hum you paid Seventy five thousand dollars in your desk and you have an emergency fund and you're putting Fifteen Percent of that and they're saving towards the house uh I think you have something to say okay\nI mean you have what's known as proof ever walking in it a kind of ... and so um I don't think you want to be abrasive but I mean if you got an old guy like me sitting there and he goes on you know I don't know if I agree with all this you say well you know you don't have to agree with it but this is one of the class works in when we did it here's what happened and what other people that here's what happened\nAnd if you do have to do heavy on somebody a little bit uh just blame it on me go on a date yeah just like I said OK and just go you know you can argue with David if you don't argue a day but you know he got so many people out of that I don't think you did sure\nSo um you know whatever it may not be that abrasive right but the point is you can good got bad guy they call it off on me and lean on that and so\nLike when ... first start speaking um I mean she was twenty four years old I mean look at what she thought sure [laughter]\nNow she's twenty eight and had three ... three national bestsellers and now a few people cares what's driving range but she just blame it on me\nOr if we're in a Christian so I think we blame it on the Bible okay you know this is what the Bible says the Bible says the bar which lies with the lender and you want to argue with that how you got yeah and the Bible you know Jesus said don't build a power without first counting the costs less to get halfway up in ... always say you begin to mark you and say this men began to build them was unable to finish\nSo you should be on a written plan is what Jesus was saying so\nReally I mean I get up with him I mean you know or that kind of stuff now again I'm being kind of sarcastic and bombastic he would be I Would even be more gentle than that in a setting in a smaller city\nThe bigger the setting the more while lying on the ah but you know when you're one on one you're just gentle and you just go I guess I'm only thirty one I don't have all the answers but here's what we did know and you know if you want to have those same results I suspect if you do the same thing we did\nYou'd have the same results we didn't have those results because of our age we had those results because we applied proven principles right you know I mean let's let's say that you are leading up let's say you were a personal trainer\nAnd the guy you or training or was four hundred pounds\nAnd he was a forty five years old but he doesn't like you tell them anything because you're thirty one and you have I have I mean come on\nYou know personal trainer you got out she got up so yeah so I mean he may have you got to ... you know you just you just kinda like this is what you're doing my point is you have proof but but you just approach it with the same spirit you approach this question well okay and that's just a a level of humility\nUm but you can be\nForceful on the principles\nAnd on the scripture as the backup for the principles and even on the day Ramsey or Dave Ramsey organization or brand or whatever as proof of the principles and your personal life is proof for the principles\nAnd if they don't get it through all of that because you're thirty one they're just using that as an excuse occur but again you don't want to be abrasive but you're not going to be you wouldn't even asked this question if you were going to be at rates right and it's just not your style it's not and you guys are okay but to really you got a great story\nThank you and you just tell your story yes this is what we did I mean you know what you want it was just what we try and look what happened in ... pounds of if you sit ups and donate this way this is what happens you know\nAnd it's applied the principals and as I say thank you so much for taking the collapse of thank you so cool that you're doing that yeah I'm an ... and you know what's what you'll find it interesting is\nThat people don't look down on age when there are results mhm okay it's when you have no proof\nIn your life or you know that that you you know that they look down and they go look I got socks older than you you know and they you know that they will but but that's what you can you show your who they wish they had been when they were thirty right you know and and so they can still be that when they're sixty of them go do it for a great question man thanks for joining us thanks for coming by and thanks for taking the class\nHaley is with us in Seattle, Washington Hi Hailey how are you\nHow do I have a question concerning some plan how am I have a point you can play

fine\nAnd I wasn't sure why that was okay are you\nFollowing it or not following you know what is not following what I teach\n'em how to answer that part of the quite variable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of an annuity if you pretend like they're usually find as an investment in the new ... is a coat that goes around the investment to keep it warm from taxes\nOkay okay and you pay extra for the annuity portion of this discussion now what you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without thinking duty coke wrapping around them okay\nSo what is the uh nudey coke do for you the coat wrapping around that to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's in an IRA already does show your mind to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you know it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay and then you move it into ... inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity will give us they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds and you're young you don't need those guarantees\nA

... years ago we were about twenty five thousand dollars in credit card debt unfortunately around that time my mother was an act the way are the only factor that was the settlement with enough money to clear all of our credit card debt and cover our mortgage for a couple of years\nWell fast forward to today we're back at twenty thousand dollars in credit card debt barely able to keep the water I'm Michael\nHow are you are I'm Seventeen years old lowered okay yeah\nWell let me help them for a second job that we aren't in credit card debt your dad is\nYou're not you're not in credit card okay\nSo if you understand the differences that someday someday you'll be on your own and you're not liable for this absolutely okay and so he's running up credit card that again you're observing this are you only child the oldest child or what\nOh well I'm actually in the middle child she has four kids and moved out and obviously the next couple of years you know it was\nOkay and so your question is what uh\nWhat can I Do they try to help him get on the right track as well as making sure I'm preparing myself for my financial future so I don't end up in the ...\nYeah then okay\nWell I think you're already preparing yourself or your financial future Seventeen years old you actually know the day brings you show is go figure\nSo I mean that that alone is is um put your way ahead of the game but most people say you know what to do and\nAnd and you're obviously observe some things you don't want to replicate from your dad even though there's probably some things that he does that are good things not necessarily win money but but it and he's probably got some good traits that you didn't wanna relocate carry forward\nUm so uh uh well the first thing is is that you learn to stay on a budget you learn to stay out of debt you learn to save money for emergencies and invest for the long term\nYou don't spend more than you make 'em you don't get credit cards and carry him around so that's how you prepare for your future and obviously you're going to have to handle your own a school ah and you know and so you have a lot of work ahead of you but that's okay you'll be fine\nAs far as ... as far as him on there's not many\nMen on the planet that will take financial advice from their Seventeen year old middle son\n[laughter] absolutely\nYou have the powder ... syndrome want someone who's powder but they really don't want your opinion about money or sex [laughter] and so he's not looking for your advice even though he knows he's probably wrong uh so you're probably not the men to speak up and caused this to happen that's my guess\n[laughter] so what are we going to do well there's a couple of things you could do um one is is there a person in his life particularly another man that he respects is their\nBusiness ability their money ability or even they're just they're spiritual walk\nA well definitely are after and I kept or have tried helping them in the past\nIt seems like no matter who's talking to them or what or how they're trying to out and he just doesn't seem to either comprehend any of it or want to replicate any of that and the very stubborn and painted on man\nMhm okay well I think if I were you ever talk to your pastor again\nYou know I I find people every day I've been doing this for a lot of years and I find people every day who\nTwo years ago weren't wouldn't listen but now they listen or five years ago they wouldn't listen but now they listen so all of us you know the stubbornness comes and goes with all of us and be in our own man comes and goes but if the past or you know just a leans in and I think\nI'm most pastors if they're going to make an era where it would be on the side of being too saw not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask her past her to turn up the heat and just a little bit more\n[laughter] and just spending time with your dad and push on your dad on this subject\nAnd not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved\nYeah you can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut and you're not going to make things worse\n... yeah because he's going to go he's going to do whatever he wants to do and then you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over book or something you can do that but you have to be real\nI was thinking about doing that for like Christmas I think it would\nJust say this summer and I read that I liked I thought you might enjoy it because you like this much\nOr something like that not like a hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat\n[laughter] that doesn't work right that's insulting and follow me and the ... you know instead you would just say are just kind of blow it off and make it not ... not make it a big deal oh that would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nJust yeah it's kind of keep it nonchalant and just go hey I read this I thought you might like it 'cause you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on a minute outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to some people aren't listening anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my dad in spite of his um\nIncompetence and this one area of his life and I'm just gonna loving worry is it's all I can do\nAnd I made that you may do that your whole life you know he may go to his grave doing this\nAnd then so your love is not conditional upon you know whether you handle money well or not your respect for him it's not even conditional on that\nBut you're not gonna take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not going to speak into your life on money issues but that's all that's all you know I don't speak into people's lives on growing hair because I Can't seem to do it on top of my head so I don't tell people how to grow here\nSo if you can't do something you shouldn't tell people how to do it right you shouldn't have even have an opinion as wild about it but people try all the time so just to keep that in the back of your mind there Joey hey thanks for calling in Mount open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Jay is in Jackson, Tennessee Hi Jay how are you\nI I Am doing
