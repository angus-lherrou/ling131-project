I couldn't I wouldn't call you stupid I mean you're not out of control you're not being irresponsible tiny low mortgage as you said but I just I just couldn't go back\nOnce I got out of this hard to

is so good\nWithout any payments so you do what you want to but um I Can't tell you to do that it would it would just like me throw up I think about it\nUm I Can't there's no way so what would I Do I'd say either you know piecemeal out of your income you don't have any payments you save up some money picks up the hatchery and as you said there's some upgrades or if you want to save up you don't say it's hard for a couple of years\nYou probably have a fifty grand two years without any payments if you watch what you're doing um but it doesn't mean that means you don't get the house that you

that it and has gone down in value from my unit different Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had I had it for five years ago right now I'm there for the units have the same style and land mine and I know the lower\nPrice at like a thousand dollars good\nA Himalayan it came on the market I have in the last one hundred Ninety five out of him\nAnd I think that if they're going to pay to have because it can be when I was thinking of cap and my eyes to one Ninety four and adding tend to have that out over paid five square of condo [noise] got\nOut that I Would pay five six seven hours out of pocket on the market chicken discharged from Microsoft and how\nWould you how much what you pay out of pocket to get rid of the thing how long would you go\nHow's he going to ... to ... obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one of the limiting factor and I don't know what I'm going to judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and they don't that's going to give me my urgency um I don't I don't want to just get emotional about it I'm On a judge the future and say these things are going down in value there's already five of them on the market\nI've got to be the one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um oh what a drop in another fifty thousand no I wouldn't you know so you know so we had some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo ah but the five thousand out of pocket will be done with this two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage out yeah that'd be done without in a heartbeat I'd do that 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation as well I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and work she gets kind of a and

taking my call sure what's up with my wife and I have paid off in Ninety four of a hundred and twenty thousand and we can kind of see the finish line should be next summer I have to tell me that if the guy driving a checkered flag or life life\nAnd the reason I'm asking that as we're about thirty four thousand dollars behind on making our mortgage caught up caught between your pace\nI'm Sorry no you're not you paid off Ninety four one twenty\nFive of obvious a step to stuff like stood on Long Island started towards the mortgage at\nAll that's not your mortgage okay well how what's the balance on your mortgage a one party than okay what's your household income or right on the hundred good for you you're doing great man killing it why do you do um\nSo what's your interest right on your mortgage and a half a minute about re fi yeah you wouldn't know riff on this um\nYou'll just start paying extra moment when you get to a baby steps six and you'll probably pay it off at about seven years maybe you would\nSay you wouldn't leave it back there even though we started off the thirty year I was I wasn't sure if we should put that in a two and finished that get caught up for them for a\nNo no no because here's the thing when you pay eight thirty like a Fifteen in other words if you calculate your a Fifteen year payment and a third of your payment and the difference if you just pay that extra on your thirty every month to pay off in Fifteen\nNow that you don't have to refinance to convert a thirty dollar Fifteen particularly with the three and a half percent interest rate and a five percent interest rate environment you definitely don't want whatever all that great right we got\nYeah there was no chance of ... I was just I'm Wondering if we should just put that as a thirty four down their heart cherry ...\nI'll tell you what you have all that I see what you're saying no no 'cause you know all we're doing is just baby step sexist pay extra around the house and you're just going to show that you're going to turn to that house it's going to happen at about the same pace as if you put it in the baby step to\nWell I can tell you that my life is going to be very happy to hear that she is just about tired of drawn out weekly menus and a grocery shopping and pension with a baby and yeah\nYeah well you need to give you need to get through with baby step to that's why we have a baby steps six where it is and you need to get through with it and get your emergency fund in place and then you know you do for five and six at the same time but you\nGuys are you know you're on track you're doing good work and I think you're going to uh how old are you\nKnow I Am thirty three\nYou know I I really think that you're probably going to have a million ... million dollar network before you're forty five\n[noise] well um I really I Love hearing that from you and one other thing one thing that really resonate if when you talked about being a father and scared in\nThe summer we had our air conditioning go out and show them great to be ready for that I mean ... eleven thousand dollar check with a baby with a nursery that Ninety degrees\nThree years without an never been that prepared and thank you for that you know\nYou're doing great man you're gonna be fine knock out the baby step two and\nMove on through three and four five six goes at the same time and you're going to pay off a house in a in about the same time as if you had done it the way you were thinking about it it really doesn't change the math that much to move the baby step away you removing it um except that you're probably going to let your foot off the gas just a little bit which you should do when you're in baby steps four five six\nBut still you know you're making a hundred how fast you pay off a hundred and forty seven five maybe six years\nThat's probably that's about the standard that's going to work out

sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole the tree and the amount that you are upside down\nAnd the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for it which is more than they will show it for the report lot so his bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences in greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover their mouth that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars less than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they
