all the winters before the games happening and uh and don't have to I guess uh do anybody who had after the fact that uh yeah\nBetween that and everything was going on in Washington we\nGot it all solved so we'll save that for another day though today we're going to talk for me yes we would look what I mean I had to call this morning\nThey definitely will and I mean they've they've you know we've had plenty of other conversations\nWith a different things as we've kind of you know done some pre planning and stuff and ah you know looked at\nSome of the situations financially about where people are and tried to talk through things like that we've talked a on the show you know where's cash flow given me before the end of the year you know you've got some big expense is coming up with a you know you see guys probably going to be knocking on the door here sooner or later\nYou're gonna have to make some decisions on fertilizer and\nAnd maybe what you're going to plant and you know just finished up probably paying your crop insurance bill and\nYou know you got all these kinds of things that are pulling money out of the account where are we going to you know put some money back in and\nYou know guys maybe getting close tapped out you know on 'em and operating notes and things like that I think you know overall what I've seen is is the guys that were proactive a couple of years ago they can afford saw that this isn't going to last forever\nWorked with their bank you're trying to reorganize or what they did have for debt locking some interest rates what has happened with interest rates seeing it kind of take up a couple of times here already this year and I I think\nWashington has been more than up front that it's not done so\nYou know the guys that procrastinate that again we talking about you know almost weekly it seems like that or put things off worry about it tomorrow\nThat attitude comes back to haunt you and are the ones that have been pro active in and prepared are the ones that are in good shape you know financially not concerned about going into this fallen and probably the ones that aren't as concerned about the weather because they don't have these other worries and ... you know hanging over him\nOr you hear much about the president's conversation this week has been about a well Canada and Mexico and so forth I'm agreeing with a much\nThen definitely I mean it's brought up right away and Monday morning we had a client from southern Iowa had come up to get some tax work and stuff down and do some planning and I mean it's first thing that is a you know looks like they got to deal with Canada so\nI mean I I think it's you know these things are still cannot fresh I mean there's other things that can uh\nI I think are are the big items on the airwaves you know as far as what's going on with\nThe Supreme Court you know justice situation but uh you know for farmers that's probably something that they still got to talk about what their main issue still are kind of these trade issues the hang out there\nYou know something's going to get resolved 'cause that's a big issue when it comes to\nUm you know what we're looking at for commodity prices and concerns there and so I mean just some good news coming out of those discussions as kinda bumped you know at least so it'd be prices and I think\nYou know for our livestock people they they're kinda optimistic that that's going to be a help for them as well and you know hopefully you know as we ticked off some of these\nYou know kind of issues between uh you know some of the more local type countries on our borders that or maybe the big looming issue with China's then you know the the last thing that hopefully that we can get a taken care of and I think that that's\nKind of the biggest concern as far as long term for farmers in what's going to be you know the\nThe prices going forward and the fuel issue too don't you remember the ethanol\nYeah it's definitely a big deal I mean I I I mean obviously the markets and and that's a big market for a you know the grain that's raised right around here and goes to a you know primarily ethanol and so\nYou know that's something that will definitely impact you know corn prices and uh\nYou know I think there's so many of those things yet that we've talked about all summer when it comes to a you know the farm program and I ... there's been a little bit more rumbling that maybe they're getting serious about finally\nClosing that deal down and uh you know probably be pretty similar in the end what we've had in the past but I think it's just all these uh you know dark clouds of Ken Hung over farmers for all summer hopefully here starting\nBits of paid you know at a is not just talking about\nThe weather that just talking about all the political things have been going on\nAnd you can deal with something of you know what that sounds so that's ... that's been the hard part\nOf it I think so too I mean you just the uneasiness with or what what can happen I mean nobody really trust I think what are the politicians are going to do when\nYou know these issues are raised and can we count on them they made promises but are they going to pull through when it comes a time to you know get get things done and so and I it just a matter of not being able to plan long term when when you have all these kinda open question marks\nBut you can always plan long term when you have corporate right so they gather with corporate farmer maple\nLike I said we just need you to come over between you and I we can hammer all these things out and we can tell you know a little personal ball what's gonna happen and\n[laughter] everything down here you have the data they reached you guys for farmers that\nThing to do is give us a call at eight hundred for Seventy six nine three wander chickens out online at a corporate farmer dot com\nThat answer whether it's president of the corporate farmer I Am Thirteen hundred cagey yellow is nine fifty to your taking the hawk or Minnesota by the way\nDefinitely yep I'm not going up there to watch them lose\nBig I sure hope so I think that they should be able to win it by a couple of touchdown sounds like that line that's changed pretty significantly so some of the people that watch that more closely than even higher tennis jumping on Iowa at this point and\nYou know it sounds like they lost their best player for the season so uh yeah I think they're kinda ... if you want to use a cliche they're kind of rowing you know downhill at this point in time in the wrong direction so\nOkay so you got to have a little on the line backer gene ... a ... that's what happens I mean it's football somebody's going to get hurt in there so things when you deal with and hopefully the next main stepped up and make some plays and and they have so far this year jets actually wanting you to do an Thirteen hundred ...\nA plane ... celebrating fifty years say with special

anything that's left in there at the year at the end of the year they keep some do not over fund it\nOK slightly under funded so what is your daycare budget a month\nI might get fat sixty five when they get sixty seven eighty or they hear Mac second day when I say it's five thousand\nPeople there you go you're under funding it automatically them so that's perfect yeah I Would I Would put the whole five thousand through there which is going to save you about Fifteen hundred dollars a year that's a nice benefit\nDefinitely thanks thanks appreciate the call Anders next in Canada hey Andrew how are you\nAll to tell you better than I deserve what's up [noise] cage so we have just recently paid off her house and yeah so we are completely debt free and just wanted to ask you a question about next steps okay\nHey so\nWe live in a two bedroom count out pretty tight we have a family of four and one on the way\nMhm so we are a\nReal case here for a little while but in the next few years we want to say about them pay cash for a larger cause good\nKilled so\nMy income is roughly a hundred thousand a year my wife know that she was on maternity leave really making anything\nIs she going back to work she won't email okay so you have a hundred thousand dollar household income what's your townhouse worth two hundred and forty to fifty and when you move up what what price would you move up to\nRoughly four hundred\nOkay she and a hundred and sixty thousand it's gone up in value during that time so you need a hundred and something thousand dollar how long is it going to take you to save a hundred and something thousand dollars\nFor our question is I I Am putting away the Fifteen Percent a month long on my employer nachos four percent of them\nSo we have the Nineteen percent that's going Nineteen percent of my income is going into retirement mhm like question is what makes sense to go back to St baby step three D. no and no you know\nWhat a what is your age uh I'm thirty and my wife is going on in okay\nWell you got plenty of time you're going to be okay I'm In two here here's what's gonna happen during the next\nThree years five years whatever it is your income is going to go up and the value of your town house they're going to go up or slow value what you're trying to buy is going to go up to right but and so we're not dealing with a fixed\nItem to do forecasting with the fix item your your income is not fixed it's you and you're gonna see some increases and the value of the town houses not fixed and of course your target is not fixed\nUm and so we don't know exactly where you're going to end up there\nBut um no I I Would say at Fifteen Percent if I were in your shoes and then I Would just save aggressively I Would take extra jobs any other money that comes your way inheritance is bonuses anything else the role that in the house fund don't consume it anytime you can get your hands on anything just do it now is fun though in the house one thought in the house fun\nAnd um but we know if you say thirty thousand dollars a year\nThat in three years and some change you'd have another hundred thousand but winters down almost be there so I think your three I think you've got three year plan you might have a four year plan something like that while doing\nFifteen Percent but it's going to be tied to be a tight budget to do that but you're not going to get back into that you know that and you didn't have to go back in the smart man Sandy's immobile Mississippi Hi Cindy how are you\nHigh bail out I Would\nThink so I'm looking at
