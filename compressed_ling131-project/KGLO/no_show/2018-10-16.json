stuff I I like the boy the best\nAnd and I you know I liked the idea that the judges are not looking and then just hearing these people saying and then they they turned around just select them if they like the sound of their voice\nSo all of them looks and all of the the other things the dancing the clothes whatever that goes with the costumes that means nothing so the judges there John judging based on\nWhat they think of the of their voices and so um\n\nYeah I think that if it's a pretty good\nUm\nThat's a pretty good people on the show this year uh I I mean I think so anyway\nI don't I don't know if it's if it's gonna be\nThe best of all time or not but I ... you never know was that get into this put a Adam Levine and Jennifer Hudson Kelly Clarkson and Blake Shelton are the ... or the judge it this year and they've got now they're at the um\nAt the main tourist days where they bring in Keith Urban and Thomas read the policy and she loved green as they try to move some of these um these performers forward and the competition\nAnd um yeah it's a ... it to me it's it's kind of fun it's kinda fun to see where they do go I mean how good are they really and um and you just don't know until you are\nUntil you see the show or in the in the fall so oftentimes I'll be able to um\nUh picked out a favorite of mine in the early going\nAnd I don't know that I had of that yeah it's\nA I think there were some people that were ... a surprise last night I'm at and one of the um one of the picks\nAnd I I again I don't know if it was just um the\nSong or whatever but I edited they pick the the way that I thought that they would\nPick it so um it's a it's been pretty good it has been pretty good so you get a chance or I Would suggest catching edging the voice\nIt's one of a one of my favorites so here in the next probably two episodes of that they do this this battle round thing\nWhen they put people against one another and they kind of compete that way\nAnd so and it allows that on a competition and then they would let down to where they're singing live on the show at that point you can usually pick out a favorites that I like this winter I was one of the teams so far\nI Would have to lean toward Blake Shelton\nI just think the blood Shelton has um he's got the better variety of singers he is loaded as he always is with a bunch of great country singers\nBut then he's got some others too that um that take a chance on Blake Shelton because he's one of the show so many times with his singers and not just with country singers\nOr he just had the an act of finding the right songs for the right people and getting the right people to work with these folks and so anyway so I like his team I like um I\nLike Adam Levine team too I think he's got I don't think he has the depth of the two ladies have on their teams these got a couple of singers that I really liked so I Would I Would say he'd be my second choice and then a\nKelly Clarkson then Jay hide in that order see

anniversary this town\nIt's our last Aaron today Jimi just need to pick up some light bulbs\nThe same thing when it comes to some of these uh entity structures is ... what ... what do you need what what is your operation require and so\nYou know a lot of those times would say okay who's involved in the operation does you know the the L O G isn't the corporations have come into play in situations where maybe it's crop insurance that we want to separate some land um for crop insurance reasons because we have some\nYou know bottom ground the higher register floods a lot and so we want to separate that from our other ground so that it isn't all pulled together for a you know claim purposes um maybe it's that we are firemen with a you know parent or you know a a\nBrother sister and and it's easier to kind of form some kind of an adult see partnership or corporation so that we kind of work together instead of keeping our ... our operations separate and sometimes you know it's for um some session planning was trying to work\nNext generation in to make that process a little bit simpler separated into different mass gets to say okay how are you going to move the ads as we need and how we going to preserve\nYou know maybe the equipment needs to move with the next generation but I Want to preserve the land because that's my retirement nest egg and so those are some of the things that we I always ask questions because again it's like going to the doctor in and saying hey you know I'm not feeling to get what ... what do you got for me and if\nThey had a job or some pills you look at 'em and go what kind of crack exists but uh you know so that that's what you expect that to your doctor they're going to say what are you feeling what are your symptoms you know\nWhat a ... ... ... answer these questions before I'm detained over prescription to you and so I think it's the same thing when it comes to that and so that's a lot of times where it's you know asking the question and then also educating a little bit on what the benefits and stuff for some of those states\nYeah you're right yeah I mean they have to know what\nYou're dealing with because everybody's different obviously\nAnd I I think that's where we kind of pride ourselves on on getting to know our clients and working with them they can understand their situation I'm obviously going back to where we started you know the biggest thing that people come to us with his concerns about taxes and\nSo obviously the when the ad is their number one priority there's some you know and the selection that you can do to kind of help lower the tax liability and so we look at you know what what is going to give you the most advantages one\nFirst and foremost in my mind is liability protection we want to separate the operation from her ... so that we protect those assets that we've worked so hard to build\nSo that's one thing that we look at with the selection number two is just the easy in keeping that business separate I still feel like it's very important that can separate the business from the personal situation personal expenses because\nYou know so many of our people they have one account and that's where everything goes through and they take their personal living expenses outta there and I think\nYou know sometimes you get lost and how much you're spending on some of these things and you know how much it requires just to live at some point and so I kind of separating those in separate cows that keeps I'm a real some on you know what what your personal expenditures are and and how the businesses doing how it's operating so\nYou know that's another priority and then you have the tax rate on vacations and obviously you know there's some benefits to using an ... specifically of some of the\nL A season corporations there I mean obviously\nWith all the big businesses that utilize those into the structures that they wouldn't be doing that it\nDidn't make sense and they have some very powerful and bright people that are helped them you know make some of those decisions so we want to utilize some of the same and the thoughts and techniques and things like that that they use\nYeah but it it's it's a fascinating you know the outside looking in and in some of that that would work and\nUh and I think if a farmer is thinking about what do I do next didn't operation\nAnd they haven't gotten together with you guys that it is time to sit down and I know today's the day of the sun's out there thinking about are both in the next time doing it is to set that one where they come on and just sit down and got to go through a\nKind of a question and answer session with you guys to see whether what's the playbook looking at my\n... I mean I I definitely recommend it I mean it doesn't mean necessarily going to get\nForced into doing something with us I mean maybe it's just the fact that he won a second opinion on what you're doing and why maybe should consider something different um\nYou know I Know going into those um kind of cool called type of appointments that it's not a situation where I'm trying to convince every single one of them that they need to come work with us because\nNot not every relationship is going to work and so I'm feeling them just as much as they are probably feeling out me but\nYou know I I think that at the end of the day what yourself a little bit just to get more information you get some answers to some questions find out if you're doing things you know the right way uh getting back to the doctor situation I mean if\nWe were diagnosed with some you know fatal disease and you know we got that first opinion I think most of us would feel like we owe it to ourselves the cabinet at least get a second opinion and most doctors probably would send us to a specialist writes a\nKind of get a second opinion and some direction on treatment course or help us with those decisions and I think it's the same when it comes to\nYou know our financial situation is that uh you know we owe it to ourselves that kind of get a few different opinions and that may be from a couple of different towns that might be from your account and then from your attorney it may be asking your bank or what his thoughts are and some of these things and\nYou know or other people doing this does it make sense do you see it working for them\nMaybe it's your insurance guy you know that says okay I hear\nYou know that we could do some of the stuff that might help me with my crop insurance does that make sense to you and and I always encourage people to reach out\nTo their people too because you know I'm just one you know\nI'm One of the wheels of them that are on that a truck going down the road and and if you don't have for you're not going to go anywhere and so I I think it's very important that kind of involve all all of your advisors in in those\nTypes of decisions that stuff jet if somebody wants to reach out and say hey Chad or hate or one of your staff members and we'd like to get together with you how do you do that\nYeah just give us a call at eight hundred for seven to six nine three one or check this out online at a corporate former ducked down\nA little bit of a sports question for those who are asking for going on here because I Know you were at the same on Saturday Night of you you didn't\nGo on the field or had a couple of people ask me about that but no I I refrain from that I didn't want a\nCoach from West Virginia you know tell me into those are unprofessional people that are starting to feel that I I don't know I mean I I I'm not against that I think it's fun to show emotion and enjoy the moment but it was fun being down there and I enjoyed that opportunity to to be down and they use for that\nBig victory yeah he was not very happy ... uh you know and you start going across the field and then he realized he ah he has they started to come pretty bad\nOr you know I Know I Would stay on the other side of it they took care a lot of safety made sure the right off the meal that everybody OK so and then the hot guy\nYeah big when there was an awesome game and it looked like the fences really role one at this point in the season ah which is great for some of it so that\nProbably remember a couple of years ago or we wondered if uh the only way we're going to win the game for defense when scored enough touchdowns to uh to beat the opponent so uh it's fun to watch just put up that many points a couple of weeks in a row now oh man

luxury started the conversation ... ... uh I didn't sign up for this and I am willing to consider helping you in this way\nAnd I think you thought you were honoring me with this and I appreciate the

of the executor shop because those are my terms for serving as executor does that sound unreasonable you\nNot at all I I appreciate that's how I was feeling as well ...\nYeah that's exactly what I Would do and by the way if he won't take you off as soon as he dies you step before the judge to say I refuse and\nI'm not gonna take it I told him always alive I'm not going to do it and I'm not going to do it after that don't get ill put into it okay\nThanks for the call open phones a AAA eight to five ... five to to fly by wire folks that little exercise right there was a really good for

jump in and we'll talk about your life in New money it's a free call AAA eight to five five two to five Daniel is in Fargo North Dakota Daniel welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nSo my wife and I are relocating for our job we currently live in Grand forks and removing the Fargo and um when we sell our home will have roughly fifty thousand dollars a year for a real turkeys and we're wondering what they would do would you put the fifty grand on on the newer home\nOr hay off something on that we did and that is a thirty one thousand dollar car loan and put the court though\nI Would sell the car [laughter] those are okay [laughter] I thought that's what you might say I'm okay what's your household and a hundred ... about a hundred and sixty five though\nHuh All right so let me let me let me kind of walk into the equation went there so clearly okay let's say that we pay off the car with this money and then that lives as twenty thousand dollars put down on our house\nAnd if you have the exact same house you're talking about buying earlier I'm a ... actually you have financed your car\nOn your home mortgage would you agree with that\n[noise] you are correct\nAnd um that would take a dumb car purchase and make it even worse\nOkay that's where that's how I got there so quickly because okay basically we're financing a Cornell over Fifteen Years\nWorking I'm not going to ever obviously what I refer to answer my what I refinance my house in order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car not a million years you know and it's basically the same equation orders saying it in different ways as we continue our conversation here\nAnd sometimes if you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you see oh my God that really has done you know and so it's not it's not as a you know it's not just Dave says sell the car is do you really want to finance this caller over Fifteen Years\n[noise] you know what I Want to do that so and it's a card for it I don't can't afford it because I didn't pay for it um if you didn't pay for it when you can't afford it so yeah I'm Sorry that I Know it's a sweet car car guy like nice cars but I'm\nToo many times are nice cars that have a set of us have them Shannon is with us in Atlanta\nHi Shannon how are you Hi hey what's up there that have you have ...\nI I'm I I'm I'm trying to figure out what my apprenticeship forget that paid at all about thirty grown here\nWe are ... and about a year he ... the maker critic at around ... shall registering for what\nHe kind of an architectural fail to this [noise]\nUm and he's got a great opportunity and we definitely agree like I said you were living on parents based that yeah we live on that and\nThat one I think that what you know and I I'm actually doing that I think he's gone down forty hours a week like we're just barely getting by ... aren't living in the sense that like\nCan you know and I've been working part time and I've had a baby but I think during and after bringing ... how how she's eight months old how old are you too oh thirty four thirty six okay All right\nAnd he took the show and he did this apprentice job how long ago\nAbout six months\nAnd there's written promises that at the completion of The Apprentice apprenticeship that he will have access to this kind of an income\n[noise] no no I never heard of an\nArchitectural sales apprenticeship so I'm guessing new to me I'm trying to understand why would do this\nYou know it's not I'm not out on like a very common thing and that's all right but in the door and accomplish and I'm an opportunity that a lot of people don't get 'em\nAnd we we never likely we totally believing that it will happen says I don't know if you're in the meantime it's like okay\nWell the only working forty hours during linked him and he's been working on the job\nRight\nYou got got bills to pay you can't pay and his wife has got a baby at home is calling me it's a pretty simple equation and he's more money so how far back what what is his income that I was thirty and and what do you how much what another thousand dollars a month to change your life\n[noise] calm ripped off I help with foreign are calm and you know like we can look at that and I that I didn't know that we're not we're just barely hanging\nI'm not trying to you for the call I'm trying to get to where you could mathematically pay the bills mathematically does a thousand dollars a month extra do it\nYeah okay what is it like living off out\nNo I'm not trying to move you out your own apprenticeship agreed to live in her basement now you're having to put up with her [laughter] those are the territories what'd you signed up for you know you can't afford to move out while he's on the apprenticeship\nWeight that's your dog gr you're stuck there for six more months or as a six more months left in this thing\nI'm like a family I mean you know actually I Would I Would get a year\nOkay I Want to know exactly [noise] ... friday Henry by friday\nI Want to know what the guidelines are others apprenticeship one of the ends of my income goes up so I can move out of your mother's basement\nThis ... this I Hope they keep their word I think they're going to keep their word but I'm not even sure what word they gave me it doesn't work for me I think you guys need the mail this deal down sort of you know what you signed up for and you know what you signed up for it so you can see a live beyond the tunnel and you can put a chart on the wall when you get to move out of his mother's basement\nAnd um and then he needs to work and extra job to get the bills paid and I'm going to guess and say you have a big honking car payment and he'd sell the car or should the gas but it's a fairly educated guess so I Would add that to the equation as well\nI Hope that helps you to open ... owns a AAA eight to five

things million I see a lot is you don't have to wait until you graduate from college to start working on that this is something that you could have a side business\nAnd start while you're in college to help you not only pay your bills\nBut then you're building up demand building up your brand by the time you graduate this could be your full time job in fact um I worked with a guy that did that he

to read a money book from a guy that went broke that's what I used to think and after seven Fifteen million bucks I kinda figured out everybody wants to buy among the book from a guy who went broke and learned his lesson\nAnd so it actually turned into my what I thought was my disadvantage what my my insecurity that felt like a disadvantage\nEnded up actually being my brain differentiate her because I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirts you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch on the furniture\nUm and you're going to put up a different kind
