these bills the foreclosure or all the bills that he opened up and your name had been paid for years\nYeah\nCorrect your opinion on them for years so there's really nothing on fire today that says you got to file by friday right\nNow today oh wait till figuring it now because I've I'm applying for other jobs that they apply for you know I lost my other one\nAnd um I have the possibility of getting hired at another company and I think they're starting reference checks and everything all along the ...\nOr ... feet or does your career field what are you trying to get a job doing\nThis um what I did before I was I I Can't play ball hit or try to get um work with a a non profit to help the housing\nThat's okay\nUm and so you think you've got a lead on that and you're afraid you might get guard sheet by somebody showing your if you got that job\nCorrect okay\nThe good news is is the instant before they go in his shoe or you could file and they'd never get it done\nSo we're still on fire or a ways away from having to worry about this so you'd have to get a job and they would actually have to file garnishment at that job and find out you have that job\nBefore you went that far you may end up filing\nOkay in it might end up that and I would certainly understand with all the hell you've been through would clean give me a clean slate\nAnd um you get a fresh start and you may end up filing a because it may be unreasonable to try to work your way through these things with your income but to day you don't have to make that decision\nOne of the things that happens when someone's been through what you've been through issue field tyranny the tyrant\nIn your head from the background and it pushes you to do things a\nVery suddenly very quickly and out of almost all out of almost a desperation and emotional desperation I Am I wrong or am I reading your mail now correct okay\nAnd so what I'm going to tell you there's a slow down a little bit because the worst financial decisions you make or when you're desperate because you feel like you're forced or you're trapped and you start slashing and flailing around like your grounding or something and you really can do some stupid stuff and I actually know how much credit card debt is involved here\n[noise] um it's probably about twenty thousand dollars okay\nGood and um do you have any other debt student loan debt\nI didn't like that yeah that's probably about twenty three thousand\nThing that is not bankrupt All right okay and you have any IRS that\nYou know just for a class on the house\nAnd and what type of a home loan that you have ... ha VA or conventional\nOn the way it would watch it off but then I got 'em all day refinance I'm at this point I don't even remember what kind of what\nIt's possible that they're not going to chase you at all\nSo if you just said that's not there and and we start making some money and we wanted to settle with two and three year old credit card debt for twenty cents on the dollar four thousand dollars that's that's the case and a lot of fighting on your part you'd have to have your fight back\nA arguing with them you can probably clear twenty thousand dollars worth of old credit card debt for around four thousand dollars\nAnd the student loan that doesn't change if that's all the case and they're not going to end your wages and you just began to work through this\nAnd you could have cleared it for for bringing them than it would all just gone away without a bankruptcy because the the bankruptcy starts the nightmare the credit nightmare the money nightmare over again right starts with a whole new\nBut if you can just clearly things up like drop off in the past a whole lot faster and they're not as permanent as a bankruptcy as you may end up being forced into bankruptcy about garnishment\nBut to day I Would not filed based on fear of something that might happen that has not yet happened the man is not real you got away from him\nRight you're going to be okay if I Am able to start paying off but that uh what do they bashed a girl from flowers that collide with ...\nI was actually the smallest a larger so called the smallest one is set up with them\nFor ten to twenty cents on the dollar and then I Would set of what the next one for ten twenty cents on the dollar ... meanwhile I'd get my student loans going on a basic payment plan\nThat's all after you're back to work and feeding your kids and have lights and water and published to live and all that which is infinitely more important than anything we are talking about right\nNow have

Manufacturers Association and his members [noise]\nSave our area of matter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nQuick question about paying off my house I Am Twenty years old working full time and I am free so that's a good ... other than my house but I have about five thousand dollars in stocks and by that roughly about Eighteen to twenty and cash money in for a long day\nUm so anyway with my house I owe about eighty thousand on it or the mortgage about three percent rate so\nMy question was do you suggest that money in stocks and the cash to pay it off the fed up fresh I Do have a job so I Am making money or a kind of keep it in the stock it could have watched grill over the past couple of years ago what are your thoughts on that you're ... you're twenty two years old\nI Am ... how are you doing all this kind of what's your income\nWell I'm only making right around fifty a year but I did have some some family helped along with a lot of\nUm why it's so small family help and and a lot of smart people our lifestyle invested a young age without Seventeen about five years of investment that is kind of help um the fact that small their money into having about Seventy thousand dollars or so and cash cash is actually\nVery well done sir you are way ahead of the curve congratulations ... well what we teach folks is to follow a plan we call the baby steps we think it is the shortage rate shortest route to wealth\nOkay and a baby step one is a thousand dollar saved too is that free but the house you've obviously done those three as an emergency fond of\nThree to six months of expenses you've obviously done that\nFor five or six new simultaneously that's Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement is baby steps or five is gets college doesn't apply here six is pay off now certainly so that brings us in our question now\nThe way I look at paying off your house with non retirement non emergency fund money which is sounds like if I heard you're right you got fifty five K. and miscellaneous investments that some on retirement and not your emergency fund is that right\nTrack and you oh eighty on your house did you say is that right\nYup okay and um\nThe uh the way I look at that is ... if you over\nThirty thousand bucks on your house\nWould you go borrow fifty thousand to invest it in stocks and bonds and my answer quickly made no\nYeah and in essence if you do a column of your assets and a column of your liabilities of what your own and what you owe that's called a balance sheet you probably heard that before\nAnd uh uh the balance sheet says that those things offset so it has the same mathematical effect as if you had borrowed on your home to buy the stocks\nDoes that mean if we if we don't if we don't use that money to pay down on the house now I Would not to clean out your emergency fund I Would be willing to take it down a little bit to\nThree to six months of expenses at twenty three thousand or two thousand or whatever it was might be a little sick I might pull that down to ten or something you'd be safe as a single guy making fifty but the ten thousand dollar emergency fund\nSo I'd probably pull ten or twelve Thirteen out of that and I take the fifty five throw it at the house and you know that house paid off in a year what south we're\nAh it's only about a hundred and ...\nThat's my point too but I only figures over the pay four hundred and ten thousand dollar house\nAll the pretty you know and then take and then you take that payment you used to have and all of the freedom that you have mathematically now in your budget and use that fifty five will be back in twenty minutes\nYou'll be amazed how fast you can rebuild and how fast you can build investment portfolio when you don't have any payments at all and that's the reason for doing it plus here's what's kind a weird you've made really unbelievably wise decisions for twenty two years old I mean you you're just you're killing your head\nAnd I think you know what else will happen is that you remember when you signed the mortgage\nDid you feel emotional weight\nUh yeah I started off with I've actually already refinanced one\nWhich I mean when you did the original deal the first time and you went from the debt free young debt free with money in the bank to now I got a mortgage do you remember feeling the weight on the of them\nYeah especially when it said Thirty years of trying to yeah\nThat's what I'm Talking about that because there's more going on here the simple math there's a complicated math that entails risk\nAnd and even even relational and I'm spiritual things the borrower is slave to the window that's the way you felt Thirty years now I Can't stand this I got to get rid of that well the same thing will happen in reverse on the positive side of hey when you don't have any\nAt no wait nothing on your shoulder it changes the way you play it changes the way you do you're investing it changes the you get so I got I got so enthusiastic dude when I got free with my investing and with my generosity both\nThat both of them went into outrageous mode very quickly and so yeah I don't get that fifty five back so freaking fast\nThat it it'll it'll it'll come back faster than the first time you've got a lot faster it's not gonna take it five years or stop 'em much you've got more income now too so that's not fair but I mean\nMathematically relational and spiritually emotionally when you're free you just do better\nAnd you just make better choices and you're already making really good choices so all of that to say yes\nI Would catch all the investments that are non retirement yes I Would take that emergency fund down to about ten or that doesn't quite get us there so you got to lean in and out of your budget cash flow out the rest of that thing and finish it up within\nYou know four or five months the debt free on this whatever it is six months whatever it takes and then when the house has done than you than you if you want to build up at emergency put a little bit but then kick those investments in the butt to get them going again and you will prosper you are on your way sir\nSo hard to talk to you very very well done wine is an Indianapolis high wind welcome to the ...\nThanks bad I just want to first say God Bless you for all the work they do it certainly made a difference in my life\nWell
