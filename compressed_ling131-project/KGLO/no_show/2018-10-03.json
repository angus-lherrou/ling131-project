you literally sold everything so the rest of it is going to be working really are I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking that's what I Would ask him when I saw that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of IV F. that you guys are looking at\nUm well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and got all park of about twenty thousand mhm I'm\nJust you know we haven't found anything or start any any profits as yeah we're just still kind of shopping around the ... what we're looking at a we spoke with other couples and all the ... who's got around there um\nLet me give you a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nFor having having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh\nYou know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I I'm a medical idiots okay [laughter] but uh I have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years\nAnd what I Am hearing\nEven as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press in and they fined several different pricing models and prices\nYou don't just accept the first opinion you get on how you go about this okay right in other words I heard the other day are thirty five thousand for one pricing model but that was like a guarantee as many times as you need to do it till you get a baby right\nOkay well that's not one we're going to do [laughter] and then I heard the other end of the spectrum I'm hearing a you know a single tries as low as Seventy five hundred a try\n[noise] and uh but they they want to show your packages and or guarantees or whatever the cause they know you want a baby and they want to help you get there I understand that but this is\nProbably add that this is also this is going to be here for a genetic disease I'm sort of what's going to be a little bit more than just you know we're not not having issues getting pregnant it's just we're working to prevent um a disease\nI okay that's cool I got I got an issue with that uh my point is it's still a I don't think that's going to change the equation\nBut I uh I I if I'm In your shoes I Want you to not just accept carte blanche to that there's one way or not not I mean not medically one way but pricing structure in approach to this\nPaying for it there's only one way to do this is the twenty thousand dollar while you're on TALK to friends and that's what they all say it's all twenty thousand dollars because they don't want the same doctor it's all those dollars ... I Want to learn about the Seventy five hundred dollar idea and try that a couple of times I'll I'll gamble a little bit with the medical profession if I'm In your shoes in other words\nAnd that helps me if I'm In your shoes go\nHey we're going to take a couple of months off and we're going to take ten thousand dollars and and then we're going to go back at it again on the debt while we see how that works out and then if we need to stop again and go at ten thousand dollars and then go back after that again that'd be fine\nThey're okay but I Will be very happy to hear that yeah I mean I I Would do that but but don't just except\nThe one guy as the only way to attempt this okay in terms of ... not in terms of medical procedure I'm not talking about that I don't know anything about that but in terms of the pricing structure and it has to do with you know the the the\nWeather they guarantee you know multiple tries you know you buy a package of five or whatever all that kind of stuff I've heard all kinds of ways of getting it is and it's kind of weird to talk about it that way but but that's really what's going on\nAnd so just learn a little bit more push back get some other opinions from other pricing structures and then based on that yes\nYou know if you want to take a month or two off of the baby step to and you know I have the cash to do whatever you're doing and then go back out the baby step to again and then if you have to stop again and try another time that that's fine I don't have any issue with that but um\nDo we just say oh no it's thirty five thousand dollars like this guy for the other day which is absurd and we're just going to stop everything and go do that because we've completely lost our minds and uh because this was an emotional subject and it's very very important to have babies and I'm completely with you I mean these are the best things on the planet I mean it's awesome I Love it\nSo I you know that that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes that's what I Would do is just learn more about it and then based on that structure you're starting and stopping of your\nOf your baby step to thanks for calling in open phones a AAA eight

...\n\n\n\n\nUs of Malcolm Brady is with us from apple a sexist talk radio where you'll\nBe All right thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise] well\nUltimately and my question is whether it's a good idea for me and my wife to sell her house um\nBasically we could never bought it but we did for now are trying to figure out the best route to go from here so that we can even get started on your plan I Would say we're a baby in the row right now\nHow much is your house by all eight Seventy ...\nAnd what is your take home pay\nThirty eight hundred a month okay\nSo why should you ever bought the house\nWell we bought out knowing that I Would need to work several ... shift of over a month to be able to afford it um we have a daughter with special needs yet ... we have lots of medical bills each month I'm and basically over time scale or not [laughter] ...\nWhere your house payment at thirty eight hundred bucks over eight hundred does not demand overtime\nYou can pay an eight hundred dollar house payment on thirty eight hundred without working several shift\nAnd find out what hello\nYeah I'm here I'm just hearing were voices coming from somewhere else\nOr my wife didn't that that may\nOh oh okay good All right so uh um\nBut the the thirty eight hundred over the eight hundred is not your problem what where are you paying and rent before\nFour hundred okay\nSo four hundred dollars is breaking you guys making thirty eight hundred a month\nAnd that's what I mean I'm having\nA look at our budget multiple times trying to figure out where we can we do have a vehicle payments we have both our cars are paid off mhm\nBut kept medical bills for my daughter are a Quaker about nine hundred a month mhm\nUm do you have that or whether you rent it or whether you bought though\nCorrect the house didn't didn't change that and when ... was four hundred dollars a month\nCorrect and you don't have any do you have any other data other than your home\nOr go alone um we have six thousand dollars in outstanding medical bills we haven't paid yeah and then unfortunately uh about five thousand dollars on a credit card or can\nYou you you've got a tight budget but this is not um\nYou know the the ... I mean I\nI ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in that okay so if you call me out of time I was told you to buy but this house is not like you know if you call me up you're making thirty hundred dollars your husband's Fifteen hundred dollars now we got a problem\nI'm going to put that house on the market but your house payment is\nWay less than a fourth of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem I think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of a a ... of dealing with a medical situation you're facing and when you're with your baby I mean when you're babies hurting they're just that's just it just wears you down you know\nIt just makes you human it makes you a good daddy and a good mommy\nBut the truth is it makes it kinda hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the drama math numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I feel for you guys I pray for you but\nI have the emotional weight that you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with this situation\nThat's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars minus a eight hundred dollars for a house payment or you know minus food honest lights modest water not to leave a lot of room but you can pay your payments on everything doing that\nAnd then you can pick up your overtime is start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them off in his late ... he's a little that's clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're going to start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I think that that you're just\nYou know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of cloudy and this is doable though where are you are is doable I I think you can pull it off no I Would not sell your house\nOr would not have bought it because I don't ... house while we got that but\nIt's your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nUh for your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you're dead gum rotted what a clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster\nSo are you have you got a couple of years are really hard work and lots of overtime and side jobs ahead of you yeah you sure do\nAre you guys gonna be taken much fancier vacations new you got a bunch of that\nYou're clean it up a ... reality but hold on I'll have Kelly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to ya and\nHelp get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can I'm Sorry you guys are facing all the challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is one of those in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how're you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you among baby step which should pay off my house early [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt because my house I have this must be merging the fun um but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really like that but anyway um I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less to pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual funds and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take a hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment put that all of the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment on my how\n... what's your household income uh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand so you can be like that free in one year after that the\nUh um yeah yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I\nIf I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nIf your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments with your borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments\n\n\nLive on the borders of Ramsey solutions Ramsey show were dead is dumb charge is getting paid off mortgage has taken place for being um W. status symbol\nOf Georgia or whatever I was supposed to say there are only sort of like a million times and I can't get through this all areas you know people always think we have a a intro a pre

Sacramento I Gerry how're you\nDoing very well and just to let you know I Do a dorm at the end up at night I I think that you out and that I fell into our head how that free\nJust by our it's all good with me how can I help\nExactly okay so we have a house on for Twenty years with our first family home and they have turned into a rental and has been to Iraq teen years and so our monthly mortgage about eight fifty per month and we are in the process of looking for any kind of thing\nAnd we had um narrowed it down to three of our top but they are unfortunately all of their credit scores are in the last six hundred and they do have little marks on their credit such as a bankruptcy\nA divorce or medical bills and a collection\nAnd added some one of our per second and it's actually just had a um I credit card that said there but like hanging down but all of them had actually gone through financial university and had chicken they catch\nIt all for it at me and and they have their emergency tiny and they have\n'em tight and can you tell them I Am wondering it is that um show as a determination act good enough to write to them and now they have a checkered\nCredit history\nYeah I read people will trigger pass all the time\nUh I'm worried about their future and all kinds of aid to the extent that they are past as an indicator of their future you don't rent to them if they got an ugly past but a lot of the others are those stupid stuff in the past the question is are we still on that road\nAnd they don't like hanging around in this case all three of them are at least making some level of effort to learn how to handle money and not be in the mouse anymore the financial pays university certificates that's pretty cool I never thought about man go through after you maybe I should do that [laughter]\nI don't know it's really interesting because they all volunteer that information on their applications and they're all very proud of that I Know\nWell I'm going to interview them and what I'm trying to figure out is two things is there anything in their past that's going to come up and tackle them like if they got an outstanding judgment that's getting ready to seize all of their income and they wouldn't be able to pay the rent\nOr something like that is there something in the past that's looming that even though they've changed it's going to still tackle them from behind okay so that that one I'm going to try to ascertain and thing too is and I think it's just an interview process\nAnd um we many times after required financial pigeon Rosemary goes real stupid that as I should have done it but I'm a we many times have asked them for a budget\nOkay that's an indicator of how they can pay if they're if they're if the your grads are donut budget and let's see you know are we are looking at their income to rent ratio\nAnd um you know if if one of these guys what\nIs the guidelines for the and kind of ... what ...\nWhat we tell folks and after you is to not take out anything more than a fourth of your take home pay right gotcha um how can they survive at more than that yeah they can survive and more than that and again I Want to hear the story around the income you know they just started the job and you know might be their incomes going to be going up dramatically in the next two years away and\nSo I have I have that they're protective tenants out like that and allow and I have I think the five hundred dollar per month terrified income and then I have on a high end ... at twelve thousand wow I'm terrified income and and\nSo I Am kind of leaning towards that the higher income with no pets yeah versus said that the lower income just for for our security\nYeah I mean I I I Am again if that's if they don't have an eight hundred dollar car payment or something I got to know what else was in the mix the whole story but all things being equal\nYeah that's the direction I Want to see that they've got the room the ability and they're not going to be tackled from behind and then you just talking to them and ask for training have they really learned their lesson another really turned the corner heading back the other way I don't really give a rep if they file bankruptcy two years ago at that point because\nIf they're trying to trying to change their lifestyle change their life you know I'm fine with that at all I'm concerned about\nYou and we'll you and are you prone to pay the freaking rent that's what I'm concerned about you know\nExactly exactly now I really appreciate that and I just thought that it was so ironic that you have all on their applications and I said you know what I can I call DeMint has got to now\nActually so all you people are trying to get a rental house if you want to show your landlord be sure wave that if they use for sure if it get in front of them that's pretty cool I like that only marketing plan for me [laughter]\nAnd they got out there all your welcome\nHeroin and with all ah with all the other things you mentioned there I'll go ahead and tell you we have no pets policy I I've got two wonderful dogs that I Love as much as I Love anything but um\nI mean there's a rule when your landlord and that's a ten thousand dollar cap\n'cause that's what it's gonna be value your house\nOr because you can't get kept pay out of a house you just got a burn the house I mean it's just it's just smells and um dogs the same way and so I Love puppies and I'm not a cat yeah I'm adult God but I'm done matter I mean we have a no pet policy\nIn the\nYou know I don't hate animals are what you people that go control your animals and let them do to my house that's what I ate and so that's why I don't know pet pet policy 'cause sometimes stupid people have pets\nThat sword amounts to and you know no no no that's it period will you'll understand y'all do understand but no one has a long\nLong time I bought\nA lot of houses in my lifetime man I'll tell you what\nAnd it'll it'll ruin your own stuff so no pets not negotiable I'd rather have the house it empty no pets\nAnd yeah you got to pay the bill and yeah you better plan on paying the bill and you're going to find those to be the nicest kindest Swedish landlords you've ever had the fix everything instantaneously because we're not broke something broken we fix it we want you to be happy and we we leave you alone which at the

stuff\nAnd you know you've had gum uh I I'm supposed to be a manager a steward of that house got owns it and I'm running it for him and saw you got to take care of it to take care of miles by the way you want to what it is\nSomething breaks over there ... and I don't know let's say in ... even though I have two dogs I don't let them destroy the um\nThe ships or would he actually thinks he's the king of the world but she's not big enough to do a lot of damage to drop kick point [laughter]\nYou know that's not going\nTo drive rooms each um\n\n[noise]\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance was not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family\nHas that and not enough savings to provide for their financial\nMates that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands\nAnd wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace so stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance sense is the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage\nAnd not break your budget Goto sander dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two\nEighty two these are the guys I personally huge term\nLife insurance as inexpensive and your

on the things that run to my street on my house is not on any of them\nAnd if something breaks I Will just pay somebody to come out there and dig it up and fix it it's that simple I Would I Do that well I Would use an emergency fund how did I get an emergency fund didn't give people like this money\nSo I had more money now are you taking a risk in the meantime yeah I mean you can happen between now and the time you build it up but the point is get your financial act together and the weird thing is it causes you to end up with more money\nSo here's what's cool you ever hear the term the rich

credit card day and we do have nine grand and like he didn't allow it so\nI'm I'm a stay at home mom and I had been worked not have retirement and I had Seventeen thousand in retirement before when I was working and my husband and I think a bit in Thailand to pay that night came to power and I think that we had a guy\nThat we can pay it out I couldn't get fired or anything like that really helped me so I might think that you're\nOkay well I guess you missed that part when you read the total only make over\n... as the answer to your question is in that book and says never cash out retirement\nUnless it's to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and here's why\nWhat's your household income\nHighly paid about by pay every month that take out\nSome sixty thousand is your take home so that means you're probably making Seventy five eighty\nIrritated okay when you put your twenty five percent tax bracket right now if you were to cash out the Seventeen thousand out of your savings out of your retirement the government is going to charge you a ten percent penalty wash your five percent tax rate\nSo you're going to get kicked in the teeth to the tune of thirty five percent\nSo it's kind of like saying hey Dave I Want to borrow money at thirty five percent interest to pay off my student loan answer would be and I know\n\nYou see what I'm saying\nThey lay down\nThe good news is you won the argument the bad news is you both have to read the book again [laughter]\nAll right thanks for the call Rick Carruthers rates in Fort Lauderdale Florida Hi Rick how're you doing sir how are you better than others or what's up\nI'm just calling about a ... to have a I bought a while back called Avi new L\nA variable universal life yes\nYes sir Yes sir I'm and I'm not really sure what to do with it I'm not I know I'm not a fan of it but again even when I talk my eyes are on the ins and outs of it I used to walk away confused and not sure what to do with it\nIs that's because of his one of the techniques they used to get people to keep it [laughter] some in the dark and treat them the lure him [laughter] oh mushroom process or keep them in the dark for the manure tried to grow mushrooms um [laughter]\nSo ah\n... the deal is this just a cash value life insurance policy\nThere are three types of his whole life universal very more universal live and just bearable life and a universe alive or variable universe alive and the variable universal sometimes has a mutual fund selection inside of it there's years\nYes enough yeah okay and so\nWhat happens is though of course that you you know you're not a fan of it 'cause you've not seen good returns\n[noise] no it's about eight percent returns but all the fees and built into it I think that it not more yeah well\nAnd usually if you're in a good mutual fund that's making ten or twelve you'll net somewhere in the seven range after fees which is due to just bought the mutual fund you might have made ten or twelve in your case you're making eight and their fees are getting you down probably in the Ford\nRanger actually will be my guess usually the ... are going to eat four to five roughly in those things\nAnd so instead of buying a mutual fund directly you're buying it through the stupid policy and they're kicking you in the tapes to the turn of another four or five percent that's where it comes down to that's problem number one problem number two is the ... the life insurance portion of it is what's called an A R T an annual adjustable\nTerm and uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy this term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then in a dress up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year\nFor one year it's not the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year\nSo you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly okay less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs just increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[noise] I have not okay and uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and gives you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nDoes that make sense it does plus when you die with Avi well they're going to pay the face and keep your investment\nThat's the worst part of it so it's a horrible plane when you die [noise] but ah it's just really bad while you're alive and it gets really worse when you die so what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage into your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet is because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just add that just got ripped and there's also means you probably need a new financial advisor because I think I think
