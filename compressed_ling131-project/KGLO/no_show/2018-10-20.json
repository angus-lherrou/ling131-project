{"month": "10", "state": "IA", "station": "KGLO", "content": "You know the situation that presented himself a was presented to them a through you know circumstances outside of its control you know it's not a great job of\nA kind of a break in that role and I'm just taking on a tremendous leadership role and and showing other kids that it's about more than just individual accolades but it's just about doing what's best for the team and um you know guys kind of rallied around that on on the offensive side and\nA running back why you know kill jobs at a pretty solid year when he has been on there and a joy Terrell is made some things happen offensively Chris Keller uh one of our smaller junior size or running by was had a really good season as well\nAnd uh you know just some of those small victories I'm ... that we've been able to have a weekend and when he got just lots of growth and\nLots of kids up and up and doing things that they haven't done before\nOver on the defensive time the football um some of the highlights there for you\n[laughter] yeah and it goes back again looking at some of our younger guys I'm quite a few juniors has had to step into certain relatives here and I know when you look at her to safety is with Kevin Rocco and Chris Keller uh they're not the biggest things out there but you know Kevin route for right now is leading a team and tackles and\nUh from the state you thought you know that's not always a good thing in our defenses may have our linebacker lead the way there but\nA Kevin Russell is on a great job safety spot following up you know Danny Campbell was uh was here last year and\nYou know Daniel entertainment tackled is now Kevin this uh this year and I'm not so positive and a Jeffrey skilled in on the defensive side of the ball has been a really good lockdown corner for us or I mentioned many guys that have been able to beat him deep and\nHe's had a few take away all over the football last\nA fried egg in a couple a far more recovery and just being in the right place at the right time and\nUh on the defensive line bashing rocket sophomore up and down and he's really excelled at the last three weeks just being around the football and then a whole bunch of his own against some of the bigger teams that we've been up again so those are some good things that you know some individuals and\nParty line up front then ... solid all year no matter you know if its cage or a ... I'm just on a an excellent job [noise]\n... um you know I I Know there have been some ups and downs certainly in this special teams can this year yeah\nDefinitely a roller coaster of emotions when it comes with special teams in some way to look it looks really solid and\nUh I Know in the middle of the season there we had a long snapper\nInjury a problem or top two or three long peppers end up getting hurt and couldn't have for us and we kind of got less searching for who's going to be the guy to replace some of the parents and adult stepped in and done a great job stamping uncover in ... ah the last two weeks or three weeks and\nI'm Eric one thing as a sophomore or just has a lot of promise a lot of potential as a kicker a you know you it's his goal is to get touched by acts and I think he's a he's got two or three ... season and that's more than than than we've had in the past and\nUm his leg strength of developing a when it comes to field goals and you know ... I think it's all a lot out of them there and\nI think one of the highlights was against Johnson\nSo where are those snap kind of went over his head and he ran back and change the ... side to the end zone\nUh basically and was able to pick it up and on the run up with a lot of fun to really get off I mean just all types of things uh you know just shows the amount of potential\nUh these kids have an you know we're going to lose a couple of great returned guys in Logan along and joined crunch heroin seniors graduating but they've had a lot of positive returns and\nThat just goes to show all the guys that are on the kickoff return team up front that they're just doing an excellent job\nYeah you're talking about the ... to ... foot python I talked about on the broadcasts a most people probably didn't even realize that he just picked it like he's been doing it every day yeah\nI just I was on the head since I just put down the sideline and the coach and said he just kept out with his left foot you know I was like I was impressed because he went back near the goal line and\nKicked up from the I think about the five yard line and ended up you know close to the fifth year before it was down I was like that's an impressive chicken heck of a play and uh he's been in some situations I Know you kind of ... I'm taking some\nYou know personal uh hits on himself or dropping a few snaps here and there but I'll tell you what you just a a heads up a player and and that will just making a play and that kind of um\nI guess approach to the game as a sophomore and it just shows his mind and and then a mentality to get better and improve a and just making players is is there and and again that's just inspiring I'm as a coach and I know kids around them a worm inspired by that as well\nYou're coaching staff um [noise]\nUh it's something we we haven't talked much about that and we probably should because\nYou guys uh many of you are teachers some do other things but uh and the only thing you do a much longer after practice you're working weekends you recognize film\nDepicts an awful lot of devotion for those guys to be football coaches to\nYeah I think about how much time they give up or what their family has to be here you know some nights were here till seven o'clock eight o'clock\nOr just breaking down practice film and and talking about practices as a whole and we'll be talking about athletes and you know how how we can help them get better every day and\nYou know weekends spending time watching film\nA you know their teachers that are preparing for classrooms or a hold on parent teacher conferences after practice is over and a lot of things and a lot of time that they put into it and\nAnd uh really it makes my job you do that because they they are still willing to help out volunteer hum you guys doing an excellent job than most of them had been around you know all four years that I've been here so I mean not\nA good because you know you you start to learn how each other operates and kind of how we think and you know we're we're all getting on the same page with things and just that continuity and its head south developed some pretty good bonds and a really helped us a work together to put the kids in the best position to when\nHe's on like this one where you've taken some hard knocks and things and that's one that you can you can say will help you build a character moving forward\n[noise] yeah I I think you know it's definitely been up you know haven't picked up a wind yet during the week nine here but uh it's a it's one that's been challenging and and one that helps you look back on you know what you're doing and and uh it helps you evaluate what can you do differently and how can you grow from it\nAnd you know personally I'm at the coach and and the situation I Know there's a lot of things that I'd like to do different\nUm to avoid in these situations but I Do know that the kids have gotten better week to week and they involve progress than you know the the attitude a multiple has been great all year long and to me that just shows and rebuilding you know these kids having the perseverance that they're having\nA you know I tell them every day that the experiences that they have even though they're not winning I'm are going to set them up for a situations in life it will be difficult to be able to fight their way through a chance to see it so you know having a lot of guys walk away and and not want to come back to practice or\nUm come back and finish the season and that just tells me that you know they're not going to give up on life and you know give up on the situation so uh yeah it's it's definitely one that's gonna make you reflect in and hopefully girl as the individual\n... a little bit of a somewhat to a football team I've taught that it's kind of like a mirror as you look at them and you kind of look at your cell is what you're saying as far as what you're doing on a football field\nYeah they run triple option just like we do they'll go on the the Fox formation and uh they'll go a little bit of ... so a lot of that they'll do shot gun and he won the shock honor the pet store even under under a center with the formation behind him the traditional why\nAre they are going to run triple option just like we do the same ... same pitch keys on\nVery similar blocking schemes and\nThose are things that we should be able to recognize our kids have seen that in practice enough they\nUh even when they're running our uh the the opponent scout defense they're still in it and one thing I've noticed a A R linebackers I've got a lot better at reading all sense of lying to to figure out the option of through our practice I mean this week uh getting ready for it so I'm always been\nYou know pretty inspiring because you know these guys are able to stop that option right away and like I said they've seen it not only running it but they also see it when they're on his couch team so it's just another week a practice really for us\nStruck her all the way it on that staff are based Seventy five it's second down seven after I've picked up three\n\nHalf your face made the trip from Mexico City tonight's a long long way\nFrom the top of I have a lot of of Iowa [noise] that was

and uh when it wasn't you know in other words they were involved and being in the weight room and showing up for workouts and\nYou know they have great attitude so a long adult and order and many Reeves men's um they kind of embody what a what we want not every one of our players were doing and and just being active and involved and\nHaving a good attitude so appreciate what they do and and I want to want to bring along a lot of people could a deer with I have to say so\nWilling to go first I Want to go first\nTo go first All right Charles Bell everybody a little bit of by yourself what else you are involved in that makes\nThem involved in a run track and spring are debating on doing wrestling this year for that year next year debating on it so ... on it [noise] ah I Do a lot of

and then put a W and then when Donald\nAll or nothing at\nAll or nothing it's on up in Alaska and we have nothing to lose yeah tell everybody what positions you play\nA I was on all things I play in wide receiver and on defense I Am outside linebacker primarily I play will back or\nIn the sense they had any play rover a little bit but I was 'cause we're short hand we've become short hand on people people being injured and so forth but I primarily play those positions I also I've also played a plethora positions on a special teams being\nOr is it called uh like I played I played up back in the past years on kickoff return then you move me frontline I've been moved from nine then now backed up back\nA ... I I started to shake off a I I did I used to play I think it was like guard fresh start playing guard for points or and then I started in part trying to shoot actually I actually would surprise on that one that's our I'm part time I was like okay we'll do that\nAnd it was like we started developing against other teams and how they were on their part ponds and so you know I kinda seated after that but I've played a lot of all I got a lot of different areas and special teams that played off into play defense so I've been around the board I guess so to speak\nGood for you so do you think that September can come together again next year and a and get over that you're talking about yeah I feel\nI feel like we could do it honestly in the beginning of the year we shoveled with something that we we honestly did shovel it showed that we started we struggled with the office we tried to put in but as time went on we adapted we we start learning it we started executing more as writers said as you said as all the other coaches and so we started executing\nWhich is very true and I feel like the past couple of games we've executed a lot more in our fence and we had a really good chance to win them over and with the new off and so we've been really slow season\nOutstanding good deal at the microphone over\nA guy to he didn't seem very nervous city did he seems ... ha well they've ever now are you never know when you came idiot proudly wearing your I Would say colors that's where you got to give you about that I was a nice ... day\nWas now yeah it was ma'am van so as the Hawkeye painted cycling fans on the team to get back and forth at each other a little bit yeah it's always fun to have that kind of competition yeah yeah but to tell everybody a little bit about yourself and and what else you're involved with\nWell I'm involved in track and field and I like to lift weights in the wintertime when I'm off and I also work in the winter as well where do you work at a fair way of good for you\nYeah so uh lifting weights how how big a deal is that any more if for high school athletic\nI mean a lot of guys straight away from lifting weights but I feel like it's a very important part of your success in all sports because it's going back to the fundamentals\nI honestly I I talked to people all the time people that are away from ... coach does too and you'll hear a lot of guys to after they're out of school they'll say things like you know if there's one thing I could do going back I Would go back and spend more time and the weight room\nTo make myself better player on the field or on the court on the map that kind of thing\nYou agree yeah I agree with that I mean it all comes down to the fundamentals on getting stronger to help you form better\nSo you guys have got to drag guys ended the weight room with you yeah\nWe really have to drag people and I mean like I don't like to less but there are also are a lot of guys and other sports in winter sports like wrestling basketball so that's good too\nYeah they get a little too you know you got to get bigger faster stronger the what the what it's all about it anymore a tough position to play\n'em on offense I play receiver ... defensive back\nWhich you like better I like often better off yeah\nYou want to throw the ball I yeah I can say coach throw away the ball right\nYeah yeah for sure I got to get a double you feel like you can get them\nYeah I feel like things get Tom on we've done work and all all season long hard on this often send me then pinpoint in this game we know we can keep up

morning and thanks for coming in early ... yeah a\nCoach or it's always fun for us to to get these guys on the air with us um and it's been fun throughout the year to to have a couple of your players every Thursday morning on the meet them on the program a it really does give us a little insight as to what's going through their minds to young ballplayers\nYeah I really enjoy a it's probably one of my favorite parts here other than you know getting a coach you guys will be around them a day in and day out it's just getting a year and I'm a\nYou know talk about their personal side and you know having everybody out in the community that listens and get to know these guys a little bit better and and stuff like that so it's it's fine um I Know the coaches talked about it you know and and uh some of the players will talked about it if they actually get up and listen to their teenage but\nUh yeah I enjoy it it's a good time\nAnd we do a a what I'll do to resolve opposed the interviews up
