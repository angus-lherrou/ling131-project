I spoke to were probably hundreds and hundreds of witnesses to strange creatures all over the years and what I've found is that the vast majority of them\nDo come across as paying ... overwhelmingly down to a rational now close in feels like they should always going to get someone who you know how she really tries to hope show just to find the states don't just some crazy person\nButs what I found is the vast majority do come across like regular\nNormal hateful but I always think that you know when you're dealing with something like the paranormal it's important to let the rate now when you know something to show her I'm waiting to speculate too and I don't think there's anything wrong with speculation providing the rate or understands that that's what it is you know\nI'm I think for that reason um you know that's the I think that's the responsible way to do it it's just sort of look at a day to an end shattering and that's what I did I put the diet tracts of papal to say and if I got out and says I tell people if I don't how to says I'll tell them\nYou know they say she's a ... or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people that make forty some

really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees that more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seeing and again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where you know something pops up and people are like want to know that was fast\nAnd then it's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Berkeley Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ... on the witness a mountain I give them out and I'm Brian Khan failed\nUm he sold the

wings but he caught it looks a bit like ... ...\nAnd I'm I'm for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite they use in that area and then like a lot of other days\nYou have this other cases it just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be a ... year than to men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nOr you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indication that maybe some of them are\nAre a very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a man and lack of trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you chose that I'm doing fine books now I'm\nOn this phenomena foreign demand in black and one on the women in black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports like that don't send anything like you know they ...\nI haven't figured out the CIA or the FBI or they had to say\nI'm a you know nothing like the concept in the movies that typically are described is looking at the same way you know go on and skin is white white white\nUm um people talk about I I seem to have the ability to control the personal hypnotized them\nPay for you to talk about when they're in close proximity to them that I fall sick after well it's almost like a superb actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when many black ... black turned up in homes right after pay for it using wage boats which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in movies more sort of like\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's\nThat's how I Would sort of describe this but many black history it's fall on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess you know I'm asking them to contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that these animals relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons I'm the sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction piles but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\nOr yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the cat will be a choice as to you that they really waited long next week so rich Shaul\nApps to explain there is a power though with the ... black where there's no doubt but in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for their mind they smoke to great but says they the January unexplained was on the way it was\nWhat I think is happening on a few ... patients and there is some evidence to support is\nIs that over the years agencies might actually have employed as the men in black\nAs a means to cover their tracks in other words it might have within government to do that many black or to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the legend about have\nResumes too to threaten and quiet April who may not one of them talking about cases

doing really well in your town and better than I deserve what's up\nMy dad was in\nThat and I just stopped looking at ... who is the student loan debt on and did you sign for\nIt um my mother like Monday I actually don't know how much it is\nOkay so she borrowed money to go to school and she signed for it you did in the sun for it you weren't the student\nOkay is that what you're saying is that what you are\nOkay if that's the case you are not liable for no when ... when she dies if she has that that that will be paid by the sale of the items that she on rooms before airs receive anything\nSo when you die you own is sold to pay off your debts and if there's anything left\nThe ash distributed to the air's\n\nBut you are not let let's say she dies penniless and she has three hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt the student loans that people get nothing\nNo one will pay them no one is liable to pay them\nBut if she has a three hundred thousand dollar pay for house it would be sold and we would pay off the student loan debt before you guys got anything in that example if there was a three hundred thousand on that for our house they would you would get nothing they would get paid\nTo do a\nRefinance our parents um ... ... how have and I'm On top of that\nSort of a higher price ugly saying she's doing stupid on parade\nFor my father is um they're not trying to hang out there I not separated from what I understand you know\nWhat you might sell it at home and not getting back together you know\nThat well that's a lot of bad news for all of those folks but it won't affect you okay unless you choose to write checks into this madness which I Would not there\nNow I attempt to get my affairs in order to stop it okay I plan on a ... I ... like hiring a millionaire so\nOkay go direct to bill but yeah you're not going to be able to you you do not inherit that when someone dies what they own style is good for what they owe\nAnd the differences left over the years that's all it is and so for instance uh for some of you listening if you wanted to keep the family home my mom had fifty thousand dollars in credit card debt than you would have to pay the fifty thousand dollars in credit card that\nI'm In order to be able to keep the house in order to keep running to sell it to pay the credit card that you're just paying out of your pocket to keep the house but bottom line is what you own stands good for what you of your assets monitor liabilities equals for network and that's all that would go to the errors in the event of a someone passing away\nAnd that's assuming you did not sign on any of that person's notes which obviously we wouldn't they especially in the case of Amanda guy I was with us in Greenville South Carolina Hi ... how are you\nKnow ... how are you to the better than I deserve how can I help Yes sir\nIt's home lowest zero relevant yeah OK cool is I'm I'm always restructuring and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now it's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] well\nCertainly he got to a live below the Marines say a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I knew people do stupid things I find the stupid things so I think you can limit\nThis thing I should do along the way that's good I like that\nBecause it could every every everybody listening right now is has\nDone or will do stupid things but it is you can manage my eyes though we should be given to Maine was along the way and live a modest lifestyle with Bluey meeting I'm no void\nSo do you think it will be done cannot twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now and finished listening to me right now\nIs probably probably even higher if they if they minimize those companies yeah maybe I get minimize or as much along the way he is\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and is that some on the math on networks to your benefit at a Wal

a fixed up a house on credit cards and borrow money from the inlaws into the Irish and no student loans and cars and trailers and everything else is out of her summary once you told me so far\nYeah we pretty much all everybody something\nYeah okay there's a there's a couple of things there's three sides of the equation that you can move the needle with here\nUm the first side of the equation is anything you can do to get your income up temporarily the two of you are you you're in order to get out of the whole you're going to work like crazy people\nI'm Wondering what's your house worse now that you fixed it all up\nIt's it's not completely gone Ali ...\nHow did you get the adoption completed if you're not living in a complete a house\nOr you wouldn't believe how desperate the foster care system that they have a we actually did not own a house for these kids who are in a contract for the I'm trying to find a bank that wouldn't be willing to give us the money for a non traditional long because their first time homebuyers on an unfinished house\nAnd I did find a bank that was willing to I'm a very pernicious within five years and ah but it would have created that truly um recently\nSo are they foster kids are adopted kids in there and got it now and they were quite as an adult and completion ... yeah what could you sell the house for right now as it is\nI'm Glad we could probably get to fix the for it\nAnd you and you are what on it one Seventy that's pretty tempting era and I'll go rent something in clean this mess up\nMy my only concern with that is because we have many a night thinking about that is our kids that we have five kids or with two biological and tree adopted our tree adopted kids all have to clear the record attachment to some fairly\nSerious mental stuff that they're working in fighting the crew and I I'm afraid that I'm ... and a shift in their life again is is gonna\nI'm afraid that parents being stressed out and never home because they're working all the time to clean up a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars or the stupid that's going to cause he gets problems\n\nIt ended up kind of all of that yeah I work a lot yeah I'll bet and you don't have a life as a scrap bones you something's going to give\nYou need to decide what's going on you or it's going to give without you deciding it's going to blow up on your dude yeah so you need to make the call I think you can sell your house\nAnd and I think the kids will deal with that temporary shift and change much easier than they will deal with two years up to three years of high stress in the household and you never be in there [noise] yeah\nI Know I'm no kid expert I just raised three but kind of and I never dealt with the stuff you're dealing with and I understand they're very sensitive and\nI get all of that I I I'm not trying to be feeling I'm just trying to say I'm a rip the band died off guy and I think even with the kids with that situation that might be the case\nI think you guys don't want to sell the house because part give them a dream of rehab of the house too emotionally and so I'm going to blame that on you and your wife I I I'm gone man I I'm\nThis how you're you're working on a house you're trying to run a business you've got kids with the issues that you've adopted you got a house full of different things coming at you at one time you need to get a few things off your plate\nI mean if you lived in a house that you didn't have to work home and you didn't have any that we got rid of\nTwo of your three huge stretchers here and I think your quality of life will go way up\nSounds really appealing to me it by the way it's stupid how there's houses on every corner you get you know the house thing but you guys have painted yourself in the corner you're gonna get pain on your change\nThey just decide which one you know and so\nThat's one thing you can do anything to sell her car or you saw much of your equipment that you've got and start the process of cleaning this out but who am I not going to pay is not a formula that takes you good places in five years when you've got some other options so I I'm\nI I Love your heart I Love what you're trying to do for those kids that are messed up and you're loving on them and trying to help them turn their life around in in the middle of that that you you're just you're good people man you're my kind of folk I liked the I Wish I could just wait wanted to make this go away but if I knew I'm going to concentrate on these kids\nAnd the quality of life my family can have over the next five years and if I don't have this that\nAnd I don't have um the stress of working all the time to get rid of that that all of a sudden I've got my quality of life back\nAnd if the one thing I did give up was this house mess um\nOh and by the way I don't have to work on the house what they what hours I Am home\nI actually spend time with these children ... swinging a hammer when I'm at home um I just think there's you you just put you put your Superman Cape a brother you're\nTrying to Seventy three things at once I don't think you can do it all and I think they're showing up in your numbers\nBut um I think you're good man I think he loves people and they keep trying to do the right thing and you're trying to love your family oil but I'm if I'm you I'm selling the house is just a stupid house you can get to know how you get out of debt you get your business built up you bring up a big pile of cash you can buy you another house and two or three years\nAnd you know settling down there and you're just like the dream of homeownership is not off the table the dream of doing a rehab ball I have three kids with P. T. S. D. in my house\nThey they just don't mix\nYou know it doesn't mixers too much going on this thing I'm stressed out this talk about all of it and I don't have to deal with it so I see what you're facing I'm so sorry but that's what I Would do and that's what they're shows about what I Would do so I you know whatever you want your grownups but um\nI I ... who you are not gonna pay is not the answer have you're not you are going to pay mom and dad does you're going to do that out of guilt and you are going to pay the IRS or they don't come take stuff um you put the student loans on her trip before you can decide not to pay the credit cards but eventually you got to get this mess cleaned up\nAnd it's going to come back to roost Anya so I'm Glad you're in financial vision burst and if I can help you further you come back anytime Lewis is in Palm Springs California Hi Louis how are you know how he did better than I deserve what's up\n\n\nLands you Dave Ramsey show\nBillion dollar

a eight to five five two to five\nTrevor is whether it's in Greensboro North Carolina Hi Trevor how are you\nI'm doing great they thank you for taking my call\nSure what's up\nA well me and my wife were working on the debt snowball I'm In July I got laid off\nI'm kind of a blessing in disguise I Am working again\nI'm making less money but a lot less stress and so what is your input on a plan that we had to sell our house who to pay off all of our debt and and kick start us going in and be kind of start over\nHow much that they have not counting your house uh fifty three thousand [noise] and so on your home will clear that yeah and they in front of a much more would you put in your pocket pass that\nAre probably about forty five plus thousand rather you know real defeated everything\nOkay and so um what's your household income today about eighty thousand okay so you just don't like the house\nWe're not in love with it though we bought at four and a half years ago um 'cause we want it to chase somebody else's dream and then we're realizing it's not our dream and it was either a mortgage racing [noise]\nYou're deciding oh whoever else you know I'm so we we don't we're not ... uh and we have different goals in our priorities have changed so\n\nOkay so where are you going to live\nA well that was kind of it ended up playing with we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put a from the other money put it in as our merged refund and then either rent for a short period of time or we built up more of a down payment or even if the money and buy smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know that will enjoy\nMhm oh yeah [noise] um\n\nThere's nothing wrong with any of this equation um but I Will be a straight with you I I'm afraid I'm hearing something else that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that is not a script I Want to join in on\nI'm not going to be happy and make more money\nAnd this idea that in order for your life to be good you have to take a dumbed down job and you're not living to your potential and I'm not suggesting you go back into a high stress situation but uh doing something you love you could make double what you're making now and it feels a little bit like your surrendering settling\nDropping down into something I don't know if I'm hearing that but I'm afraid I'm hearing\nThat well actually long term goal I did want to own my own business um this was to get me back working and to have an income um we we were already planning you know long term things that we knew that getting out at that with our way to get\nTo where we want it to me so yeah I I Want to make more money okay All right now it it it so that they can be working and working on our future plans\nAll right I'm ... and so this this um move down in house are moving more than half of the house uh it sounds like a ultimately but even if you rent for six months or something in our moved back in the price range\nA you know it wouldn't be if you're worried when making sense I'm ... and so this move down to half of the house has probably three to five year plan\nOkay\nAll right because you're going to do something to get your income back up a without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work a gift that poured I'm not asking to do that but I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that's not an equation I'm going to participate in agreement 'cause that usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were for it\nOf care organization that we believe in it wasn't that the ... you know they wouldn't do mission and so we're trying to looking at trying to get what we can to people who need it\nUm but if she's on the other hand what it's like a church I think what we don't we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give the church and\nHad a big argument about either yesterday I was\nOut on the the definition of the eyes the definition of the time is when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed good in the New Testament is chance it literally means chant the word means can't\nIt doesn't mean fear that doesn't mean twentieth it means camp now you can decide whether you want to ... you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says his or what may wrenches opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker ... Tucker's opinion has done matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do\nIn his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you I Love you and you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to give and all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed\nThan the New Testament is a time like tens of you're in from evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years that that's why this is your baseline minimum given comes off the top [noise] before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the argue\nThat the biblical lots of your wife was argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually those are probably true [laughter]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nThey actually managed to make something that was already difficult to understand even more confusing\nIt's never been more vital to your business to consult with attacks professional to determine how the new tax law will affect your business employees and quarterly filings I'm Talking about consulting where they tax in the worst local provider here are some of the changes that affects your spending now\nThe ... those meals and entertainment adoption is gone any meals drinks or ball games for clients is on you there's now I one million dollar to adoption for equipment which means you can write off the phone calls rather than just a portion of it those are just a few things\nMaximize the new tax law benefits consulting with the tax endorsed local provider near you and Dave Ramsey dot com slash E.
