whether this this morning with Mason city volunteers that are always good morning Tam I Do is\nDoing well doing better if there wasn't this little light dusting out there hey\nYou know it takes a few days ah but this last weekend movie we saw some of that are just reminds us that it can and will ask but it\nHas this year if it's happening in January oh this looks nice\nA nice did not know hey I was just mentioning to you I I saw the headlines about your notes for the day of the living a better they'd be happy as being able to make others happy and volunteering allows you to accomplish both\nThat plane that sounds like a campaign why not campaigning but I Do really afraid says and I see it happen every day I'm\nYou know like volunteering does for people and you know for some people I guess I'm an opportunity to change people's lives and we do see that happening and it might be small things and\nUm it also can change your life when they see you know the good that comes out of their volunteering and\nUm it gives you satisfaction if they're really saying we're all in someone else's life helping people who might not be able to help themselves so tiny carrying as just a a great way to get back to your community um develop some social skills for maybe some people that are going to college that need to get out in a chair and\nGet some some life skills going\nAgainst and pollen tear or not pollen chirping some valuable experience just for for them and\nThe other thing that we know is on hearing does play a significant um health benefits so I'm In that chair I'm half a lover rates of cancer heart disease I'm obviously we do it's health care costs are an outcome of ... so a lot of a lot of good things come out of that\nKind of amazing is that when you say those kinds of things are statistically like the good stuff yeah and it's just the volunteers gain as much as they do\nI mean it's it's really fun for us because we talked volunteer as almost every day and and hear the story so you know we hope that people are just take a few minutes today go to our website and consider one of the volunteer opportunities that are listed there usually we have about a hundred at any given time and\nJust ... center dot com click on a sign up for volunteer opportunities as the ISI have on the right side and complete the farm and you know that form it's important for us to to know what what are your cats in your skills and tell us or basically what are your interests and at ...\nSo that's really match you up I'm really well with the opportunities that are out there\n[noise] you know there are a lot of things people can do an awful lot of things [noise] um so what would we said today that would encourage you to volunteer right now\nOkay I'll ask you what can we say and you say you know I people tell me all the time oh I heard on the radio so now we really need people to go out in ... there are a lot of volunteer nice out there and\nUm we just you know we have forty members of the things I'll enter center right now that I'm most of them have a need out there on our website\nI Would say that so I went back up because one of the things I was thinking about oh with volunteering in in our area is the number of years ago the school decided that they would do with her silver record or whether it's this program for that program to get the students involved and volunteering\nAnd I think that may not totally show up right now but I think it showing up better than it did certainly five years or so or you have to go right you know a building that I think that's\nRight and just you know I could example of that is that those kids a thousand next to the high school kids out on homecoming day or the friday hum of homecoming and doing projects that across to our city and that's just really phenomenal just see\nYeah and and a lot of schools are doing that are like really really good so I Would say um if we don't do it it won't get done so that's kind of me the way I look at voluntary so hopeful volunteer\nTo and and I'm Glad that you mentioned the youth and how important it is because really and went back and I was looking at our members and really twenty five percent of our members work in some capacity with the EU and so I thought it would be fun today to talk about\nYou know if you're someone who loved working with kids or if you don't think you are I always professed that I'm really not a ... percent but it really is amazing when you're there and just see how\n... thirty one thirty nine for three hundred Seventy nine yards and a

but hopefully uh things will get out of the field and we will have a good fall for sure well and you know uh with the\nProducers going as fast as they are going right now I'm not really a lot of time to stop and think about other things like taxes or you know things like a state plays ... ah you know\nThat's something to that you kind of got to throw into the whole bundle Chad of ah the the operation and having a plan in place a as a things progress down the line generation after generation it's important to have a solid plan in place otherwise things can kind of just be a big mess\nAnd I think you know the reason to talk about a little bit today is because you know after we do get out of the fields um you know most of our guys are going to then refocus back to end of the year type planning\nAnd they've put off probably for the time being inputs and a lot of them haven't decided so far you know maybe even the are they going to plant\nAnd uh you know get on the schedule and say hey you know I'm going to commit to this and I'm at least are going to see it through and and uh and that doesn't mean that you're going to again complex at all in one day or one afternoon it means that we're going to start that process take that first step and I think you know\nIf a if you think that uh you would like to meet with us to discuss how to make that all work\nYou know I'd say to give us a call and and uh you know once you get done in the field than we can start start that path with you\nDefinitely that's very simple can make that call like I said or reach out to online

different little tidbits posted on the other two more follow along on social media that's a that's another way as well and you know like we said she had a it's that time of the year a harvest is busy but you got to think about somebody other things that go along with the operation too\nAnd it definitely want to uh you know recognize that harvest is going on and that and we're glad for our clients and farmers in the area to be able to get out there huh\nYou know obviously like everybody we recommend that you cannot be a little cautious as you come over and announcing gravel roads or you know there's a lot of traffic out there and everything and so a lot of good luck to our farmers are hopefully they can get kinda finished up with harvest or at least get a good go at it right now and uh\nYou know we look forward to a completing fall and being ready to get back into the saddle in and start making some financial impacts decision for the year\nDefinitely look forward to a high school

five two to five\nCents for only eight to five five two to five [noise]\nDanny starts off this hour in Des Moines Iowa Hi Danny welcome Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are hit or\nBetter than I deserve our you\nI Am fantastic it's an honor to be able to speak with you today and uh you and your advice and books have changed my husband and I ... I'm so excited\nWell I'm honored to speak with you how can I help\n[noise] well I Am wondering my husband and I have five children together I have had three children from a previous marriage and I have two children from a previous marriage\nAnd we are currently on September to me to have a few thousand dollars left to go before we're able to kick our debt goodbye mhm\nAnd so we are planning on a\nYou know helping our children are calling as much as we can ...\nAnd ... five of them we realize that could be a significant sum and all five children currently have five twenty nine plans that had been funded by cash gifts and things have received from their grandparents over the years good\nI'm into his boys are are significantly further and math and my girls are my girls are quite a bit younger but we can kind of want needy around about ... to ... on what we should\nPlan for each child or how to help each child through college because I feel like it could be such an enormous amount of money over five of them but we also want to help them out as much as we can so\nOkay there's a couple of ways you can calculate it um as far as your target amount which is you know your target amounts you're was to ask for that then you can back into how much you need to be doing\nSure the ones that got a little bit of a head start 'em they may be a little bit older are so it might come out fairly even I don't know spends on how much of a head start there is and it also depends on where you're thinking about going to school so\nIf I were in your shoes it doesn't sound like what's your household income\n[noise] we had um a little over a hundred thousand [laughter] okay are you guys millionaires\nWe are not yet a mature on your way good we are going to have five kids going to school how old are they what's age range\nOkay the youngest of seven mhm well fourteen almost sixteen and Seventeen ooh God I'm going okay in\nAny minute here we are going to start this process okay somehow I admire that were younger but I was well\nThe older ones or you're going to be you're just going to be writing checks remember cash flowing into that direct ... all the money you're saving one year is not going to change this\nWas in the process of getting out of it this year still so um that does answer my question then you your target is going to be in state schools\nHave to ask for number one the cost or the number one mistake people make with college is college choice\nThey sign up for a school that freaking can afford and they come out with a hundred thousand dollars worth of debt because they went someplace they shouldn't have gone\nYeah my heart can't afford it it's the same thing is ... better than a share of her life probably ... you know it was probably better\nIs it more expensive yeah three four times more you know the same thing so can you get a Chevrolet education and be fine out here yeah most of us function on that\nWe didn't go to a prestigious schools that were a hundred grand a year\nYour kids aren't going to either unless you're going to run them deeply in debt which I wouldn't recommend so we show you call you know your local\nIn state tuition schools that you think your kids might go to and you find out how much it is\nAnd we have we've gotten a pretty good start on that we have a a great program here in Iowa that are high school kids are able to take college courses for free and a lot of are a lot of the kids graduate with not only to high school diploma but also they're two year degree at our local community college uh we are\nHighly I'd seen each other and to do that and who out of out of the fact that they're already doing that and kicking college classes and I'm a command\nOr if you took community college is free\nWell if you were taking classes while you're in\nSchool yeah yeah yeah well the other thing you can do is if you don't do that and your graduates Moscow you still can go to community college about a third the cost of the typical him stay called four year college\nAnd the first year if you don't have your first two years of stuff studies out a way because most of the core stuff anyway and you just make sure that that community college or transfer full credit into you know I'm I don't know University of our or wherever it is they're going to go right\nAnd wrong or I Wish date or whatever it is you just look at that and you lay it out and say this is where we are going to go which is what it's going to cost and then you back into your budgets on it and go okay Seventeen year old we're going to be casual into college choice is your biggest\nVariable and a kid going to college debt free variable number two is they make their part time job filling out for scholarships\nYeah jump over a hundred and eight dollars suddenly filling out scholarship money and um you know we're we're meeting parents and kids who were you know that they're they're getting two hundred and fifty twelve hundred and fifty twenty two hundred and fifty dollar scholarships\nAnd add them all up in a pile and they turned out to be thirty grand and they pay for school not a bad part time job when you're Seventeen\nAnd you work your butt off filling out\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year younger people do that but you guys aren't living on a plan to businesses now planning your personal lives on a plan I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I mean we just got ... in the mail today and whatever that that\nThat's a good start ... and I'm going to send your company the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going no one can quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not gonna quit that but what we are saying then is is that we can get behind and give\nA I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it is we need to find tuna systems at the business the profit and loss statements though the budget set the business and so we know exactly\nWhere every dollar at the businesses going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home

a hundred percent some of them do have a co pay you after you meet your adoptable\nEither way you do have a higher to duck to bowl with a nature essay and they lower premium as a result\nMaybe you'll

you're hardly ever sick Ramsey knock on wood we hardly ever end up with the dock then in that case obviously we save a lot of money because I'm only pay what comes out of our pocket and we never go to

is after getting her policy\nAnd use that money to put into our festival\nAbsolutely\nYeah they're horrible product they're just um you know the whole life is the payday lenders middle class I mean it just as I write a ridiculously low right of return on their money and the worst part is when you die they only pay the face value the policy they don't pay them\nThe cash value also which means the extra money you pay to build up savings in their disappears at death\nThey keep your money you know and so it's just a bad bad product the math on it is hard windows and you're you're much better off to buy inexpensive term insurance and do your investing anywhere except in a life insurance product and so\nUm that's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\nThere'd be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes the or the other words what you paid into it it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you\nDon't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't write the law but you ended up with having put more into it then you get out so there is no game now yes um and it happens about five percent of the time with an ... with a very very old whole lot policy\nThey there it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in but you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nFor Ninety five percent of the time Ninety
