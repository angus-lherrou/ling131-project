lay there will be open to inside lanes are still some work to do on the north side I guess we'll see what the sidewalks and things like that so that that label will be closed off so the contractor so working there but there will be one way to traffic open\nInside lane so that will be a that would be nice [noise] opening it everything back a little bit closer to normal than traffic on the\nEast bald lane sixth street will uh there'll be one way like they are right now while the contractor gets in and on the inside shoulder and stalls are deciding that needs to be there with everything facing for\nThe tropics that will be one way as well probably for about a week but then that should be open up the two lanes\nUpset also said there is one area of the project where motorists can still expect head to head traffic for just a little while long\nTraffic will head to head between Massachusetts in Carolina on the east end of the project they have to finish up the south side the self two lanes in that area but a working towards that goal isn't mentioned November twentieth of having everything open and right now we are on schedule\nThat since the first phase two of the whole project for one

postcard well farming and the ... yeah\nI mean a ... year you may drive by going down the road that corn sock it to be a you know harvest that okay you might get that part of it but there's an awful lot that goes with it that the average person um that's real close to it doesn't even get\nYeah I'd recommend somebody in town and go out and just you know if you know somebody that farms go visit them in on the weekend and ride around with them a little bit in that combine there's probably more technology than most of the offices or businesses here Mason city I mean it's crazy how much a fire\nPower there is inside that cab when it comes to keeping track or you know moisture and mapping and yields and all you know all the stuff that is going on inside that cab not to mention that the thing's driving itself right so you know I mean it you say\nIt's complicated yeah they definitely farming is a lot more complicated than when I was a kid and uh you know I mean it's just amazing how much uh that whole process has changed just in a short period of time all the rules the\nRegulations the tax things that that needs to be followed and taking care of and uh you know a fitness versus parts\nIn all of the breakdown that are there\nIt's just nice to have a partnership with guys corporate farmer to the kind of help\nAt least let like breathe easier than in the end of the year you want to finish a feeling good about right Eighteen and looking ahead door Nineteen is a great\nYeah make sure that you get some plans in place and I I mean it's no different than counting on that monitor that's inside the combine I mean\nThat's something that they they aren't able to do on their own that they need that technology in order to help them you know do what they do um farmers many acres is they do and and you know continue to produce the a\n... that they do and so you know when it comes to the accounting in a\nUm tech side of things I mean why would you not want somebody similar professional that knows what they're doing to help you with that process because then there's just not enough hours in the day to try and stay up with all these things that are going on and all these changes and\nLast minute information coming out that still ah you know from laws that were passed ten months ago at this point in time [noise]\nYeah [laughter] I don't think I Know it seems like that forever ago but we still don't have all the guidance and we're still kind of trying to digest a lot of it and and so for farmers up there to try and weave through that whole path and\nUh it's probably not something that they want to do alone no no\nAnd for you guys I mean your your staff or it's a it's a day to day thing for you guys stay up all of\nIt is but I mean that's probably why I enjoy it is you know the change if it was the same and it was monotonous the you know from one year to the next day I probably wouldn't enjoy doing it I mean it's it's one of those deals where I think that the\nFor us that get into that that it's neat to see okay here's the changes now how do we need to utilize the ease of you know ... if we get a new tax credit is beneficial to take advantage of it should we you know jump through the hoops it takes in order to qualify for it or does it not make sense and I think\nYou know that's why our clients trust us is because they know okay hey Chad tell me that tell me about this\nYou know and then you start talking about I don't really need the details just tell me whether it's\nWorth the I got to do yeah yeah I trusted you just tell me what if that makes sense or not and\nIf it knows what am I gotta do you know I trust that you'll ah tell me what makes sense for me and so that that's kind of where we are with our clients and that's again why I enjoy those challenges is because uh you know it's nice to be able to help people and be able to point I'm In the right direction\nYeah I well I can see that for sure trying to gather everybody up and get them to uh to corporate farmer this time of year probably a good time than to\nIf you're done or if you get you get that rainy day I Know there are couple of little sprinkles maybe in the offing you get a little time to set up an appointment publish still good idea to do that yeah I mean we've had a few phone calls at\nOne yesterday from a guy that I mean the combine so it may not answer back when you call me but I'd like to get together with you and I can talk a little bit about your services and stuff and so it is a time I think ah where a lot of our\nFarmers are out there and not thinking about things get a lot of the time and uh you know they all want to see okay what are the are going to be like him I really going to need to do anything new I Need a change all those types of things and so usually they put it off till about this time of the year if ah\nIf they're thinking about switching and so uh you know I I think that it's probably the biggest time for us to have those types of uh meetings and the prospects and and people don't want to get a little more information about a\nGood idea to do that how they how they get in touch with you guys\nYeah give us a call eight hundred for seven to six nine three one or check us out online at a corporate farmer dot com\nWhich is a guy on the other day that I had to get yeah he gave me a couple of days at least they can come down um yeah it was disappointing I think for all of us we felt like it was a game I'm going into it that we had a chance even though it was going to be tough and then\nYou know with the way that they played and pulled out all the stops and the first half I think ah\nFor but he felt pretty excited about the second half and it's just you know execution has been difficult for a team in the last couple of years especially in big game you know and you know on the road um\nWith uh with some bigger teams they've had troubles are kind of doing what it takes to win the second half and that's kind of I think what happened on Saturday\nYeah and I I'm a steady in the crowd the weather can earn an awful lot of things play into that and I you know\nA yet as families there he's got a fair shake that went off because of that game Iowa was not going to the door mhm uh two more plays ... and they win that game as opposed to losing that game yeah um\nAnd so yeah pretty tough to take pictures of the friends of mine were out at the game and you know they're standing in the tailgate a darn near up to the rank of mud and so I Know the condition of the best um but yeah it is a tough place to play it is yeah it always has been\nIt is it's more of a pro style let's say they feel to it I mean which is different you know for the Big Ten because we have a lot of the more the historic type\nStadiums and so uh you know that's a little different environment and then like you said I think the weather the DV didn't do it justice and what it was like there and\nAnd I know that that that caused some of the issues that we saw and unfortunately first day in Miami and he's taken most of the heat at this point in time and you know he stood up afterwards and took responsibility for it and\nHopefully they learn from it they still have a chance to win the west and you know they can control their own destiny there and uh\nYeah they can win out maybe we'll still see him in Indianapolis but obviously they have some things they need to\nFix before that's even going to be a possibility yeah and and but I Would say yeah that was a great I've watched that beforehand and you know another great victory and they're kind of starting to catch some momentum so uh they're fun to watch that's for sure\nThey are they really are just going to say I have great

car and drive it for six months or four months while you're talking about a bunch more money and get your Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car that cash for it\nOK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen then drop it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash\nOkay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the armchair and

I'm saying and the sure\nYou have a second mortgage on your house you're that you're going to stay on the house and you're paid off ... absolutely and then you can also first mortgage and then hopefully by then the rental will come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd on your debt for uh yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on something Michael ... rental property up as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand upside down the toilet wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in\nThe U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't but I'll give it to another year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to write a large truck to get rid of it I'd rather I'd a hundred and thirty six dollar check than it would have forty thousand our checks all do that for\nA little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling on tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out to do that it's just where you ended up marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it and in the meantime pay off your second then pay off your first there we go think Kevin's with us in

part um\nMy dad came to me a couple of years ago and um he was getting ready to retire on a\nTakeover offered for me to take over a whole life insurance policy for them I think he just kind of looking to get rid of the premium before he retired I Would like to get rid of it now knowing a little bit more about life insurance but he keeps telling me I Need to hang on to it mhm and they had heard that when he retired when he\nSays I have money to pay the taxes on ah the inheritance money that will be coming to me [laughter] so how large the sister state [noise] uh I Would say close to a million\nThere's no taxes on his state so he doesn't know as you on TALK to them\nNow you don't have like ... there's no tax federal there's no federal or state tax on states over ... ... unless they're over five points for nine million this year\n[laughter]\nOkay so everything like Phil ... for ... years can you can pretty much like there's raw than his throwing caves and all those things so\nIf it was a state is one million dollars there's no taxes on their problem pay any taxes on any of it\nNow you might pay a state probate tax but there is no federal estate taxes on the site of one million dollars\nNone zero K through\nSeveral million dollars for the fence to get off the show so he's got you know what he's doing he's parrot back what the idiot whole life agent told in the ... you need to keep their costs state tax planning and and he's been hearing that since you were born and so he's a betting those same words back out like a parrot and the cage\nOkay but I don't know
