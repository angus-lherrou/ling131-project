pay cash for it\nUm and you know a lot can even if I get tired Nineteen months which seem to be high but for just supposed to be temporary so slowly today they are in contact with my home up in Colorado and we had an offer in our house for cash out cash offer\nWhich is not the poll that are on Earth Day to buy one and the next Thursday when this why well apparently are real tricky not shy to the buyer is how\nThey can put in to threaten the actual application\nTo ensure the kid mountains of buying a house for him does not have a job\nSo he probably could be just qualified combined homey and we're thinking out because we took his mind sixty day loan out of Iran\nBecause it's kind of like why did you do that [laughter] yeah it's exactly what they said you know all night because the stock market and if you're going to be a temporary transaction back in right away and no penalty\nOn your day you know what's the concerts gay or whatever if you don't close on Thursday\nI what being told if we had the option of St stand out into the leak cashed we sell our house and I wanted to know what you felt about these cats alone would you\nWonder if you don't close on Thursday\nI guess if you're going to be they have backup office already and they tried to home\nOkay so ... this is a knock the manufactured home and this was a home\nYes manufactured home actually what stand even make a ten to twelve thousand dollars\nYou know how much of a how much of an earth my check that you put down south yeah you're probably gonna lose that if you don't close right and and wish your mind Iraq to have a contingency on the sale of your other ... you\nKnow they would not allow him to continue out here a house gets an album sold by the end of the day\nYou know so I'm trying to save money market you know so I'm ... years what you're doing you're getting desperate and every time I get desperate I get stupid and you're about to have either been unit or not close on this house Thursday let it go\nAnd go okay well that's what I'm telling myself just to how they work and on house to house sit and you know we feel like you're getting thrown away to Ninety dollars a month that you may\nBe but it's just a house six hundred dollar a major problem you're getting ready to make a multi hundred thousand dollar problem and then if your house doesn't sell over back in Iowa for two years you're up a creek\nAnd health care in any any um humor in Longmont, Colorado working in actually\nIn Long Beach the manufactured home that didn't that the kids not closing on\nHis mind oh okay ... gill okay and they just found out yesterday for a realtor what she had shared if the kid heritage put the cash for weeks ago when they put the offering for her and we just found out he didn't\nYou just need to sit there and you're manufacturing home manufactured home until you get it so when you get it sold in when it closes only then can you close on another purchase [noise] if I mean if that means you rent for a little while in between that means you rent for a little while and between the two houses\nYeah I Know I don't really I needed to be honest I don't do a ... foot brother\nAppreciate that but don't do it you know what happens is is you get caught everybody does it I'd do it do you've done it you get caught up in the the the narrative of it is the story of this and it starts to feel like you're stuck and you have to do things\nBut you don't have to do anything\nUntil we don't have any interest a house\nI Know it's just that how do you remember your heart so big an open when you move to Colorado When you're trying to adventure I Know everybody kind of their fingers just the opposite of that and you know your heart heavy like it's in a cage\nAt ... ... yeah I told my husband I feel cornered right now ...\nYou know why don't you feel Warner is because you're cornered could that's real court so here's what you do when you're cornered you throw up your hands when you walk out\nYeah I did that last night I walked out my husband was talking to her I said I Can't even say I\nHave not dealing with it I'm not talking about avoiding sometime I Know I mean you know ... I'll be happy to close on this deal when my trailer shells\nYeah when my trailer is sold my trailer hasn't so I Can't close until that happens and so you guys have your dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to them that kind of guy and that's probably what's gonna happen oh well there's a house on every corner in Denver\nYou'll get you another house and don't get desperate\n'cause as soon as you feel corner to show your field as British or you feel forced\nThat's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you shouldn't close on\nIt should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it one 'cause you're just not done a close\nIs if you do you're going to regret it you're going to end up falling both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem it's going to damage or finance or it's just going to take a decade to recover from a bad decision walk away or tell them just we're going to tap the brakes boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get this closed\nAnd we'll close if we can and we're not going to be able to oh we're gonna go to the next guy well I don't know I understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday\n\n\nIn Miami to show\nLike the um\nYour life and your money it's a recall at triple a tape she's five\nFive AAA eight to five [noise] five two to five K. C. star\nSolve this hour in Tallahassee, Florida Hi Casey how are you\nKnew or I don't much do better than I deserve how can I help\nUm I my question is what we've been doing a program that some of amber and gotten rid of a lot of good my mother\nShe babysit their kids or our kid right now will be two here and November I'm and she is planning on moving back so\nRight now we live with my mother in law which is my wife's mom\nAnd if my mom leave my wife has to quit her job to take care of the kids because the cost of childcare here is exponentially high\nUm and we have an option to move down there with them\nI'm I'm thinking we should but\nBecause of all of our jobs are transferable mhm we could transfer their Phil ... for a job if she quits also we are health insurance goes to my health insurance which is a lot more expensive than her and so what does your wife make\nEr about thirty two thousand a year\nAnd I make around forty\nYou know she's not going to know a lot out for daycare on that was loose motive she basically be working for daycare on health insurance but mainly yeah I'm just not gonna be paying twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be a you know Fifteen hundred in\nThe Eighteen 'cause I'm a little bit of one or two babies okay yeah I'm All right uh and and what do you do for a living\nI'm In sales or my wife works for the state what are you so I'm Out of control and termites stuff like that\nAnd that your company has a branch and the other city\nOh yeah throughout the state okay um well here's what she waits which was living and I think I Would want to decide where idle Leo's\nBased on some formula other than where the babysitter live yeah okay\nI don't like that formula much I get how you're going there but I think you need to decide where you live based on the quality of life based on I Want to be near family based on the job that I Want is their land we figure out a babysitter\nI'm it sounds like you're following mom around a little bit I don't mean that in a negative way I mean yeah it's just the babysitter thing at a drawing you and you know and and it it feels like that's the wrong way to make this decision I'm not sure it's a bad decision but I I yeah I think it might be arrived in the wrong way and so it wouldn't help your next\nTime so I'm you know I was asking myself okay you know ten years from now when these kids are are are late teens\nWhat I'm you know what what what\nWhere do we want to live what do I want to be doing for a living at that time and those are kind of moving our life in a long term trajectory a long term mentality trajectory rather than just oh God we got to have a place to go to measure\n[noise] well I grew up down there and my brother lives there and their family and my cousin my wife doesn't have any family here so when you're living with mother in law All right yeah well she's the only family she has here in the state her family live in Cuba\nOkay All right well I mean it if you know I Want to be near family and I think I can my career can prosper there as much as here or more uh maybe because I Know more people are and you don't have more credibility to sell pest control or whatever you're going to do what city are you talking about moving to\nA would be North Port which is court Charlotte area or just below Sarasota\nOK okay bicycle suburb of Sarasota yeah yeah pretty much right and that's a\nGood strong economic market and um yeah um you know in terms of your your long term uh\nProspects 'cause if you could sell you could do a whole lot of things and make a whole lot of money over time maybe and maybe even a different form of sales at some point in your life I'm thinking\nOut there ten years you know where where do you want to be doing ten years from now where do you want to live ten years from now and does this take us there I don't see a reason not to do it if you want to do it I just don't want you to let let's say that something happened to\nHer ability to keep the kids later and you go home and we moved down here for that now you moved down here for other good reasons and she happened to be there to keep the kids\nUm that's the kind of the way I'd want to view it because it's more of a permanent decision then we're not just\nUm you know bouncing around because you don't want bounce around that that'll cost you a lot of money and a lot of\nEmotional pain Victoria's with us in Hattiesburg, Mississippi Hi Victoria how're you\nDoing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nDown there that aren't that college tend to get married at out for a month ago we have forty thousand dollars in cash in the bank wow where'd that we both work a lot about the job I'm Out of mind for mom and I'm like at a bank of our kids wow look at you why to go\n[noise] care and we're at the point where we decide here we go ahead and purchased a home or a daily and that all of that\n[noise] um and how are you paying for school\nWe have a full ride department that get paid up Fifteen thousand dollars each semester mhm on the cover I think that this may want like housing ... ... ...\nRight and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on fifty seven oh\nOkay ah and it's nine percent non prevent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pinch and we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run true it's all horribly run state\nAnd now we're better than all those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted as a four or five\nIf we can all those are for them that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got to put in that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly wrong and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so I don't know that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and goes round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting them Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but you know I was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so um\nUm you know go do it\nAs that's but that's what I Want to back it off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us today Ramsey show [noise]\nMall big giant extraordinary things start from ordinary things and

how are you [noise]\nHow Dave I'm doing great how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nA plane for the call I'm a university\nProfessor who get paid over my mom pretty good at it for summer living expenses and credit card and then pay them off after getting paid to forgive them\nHowever on the ... you know they're monitoring is about what what kind of ... in baby steps one thousand dollars should I thought how money for the three months if not getting paid\nAnd then we could pay off their credit card or should I start to pay off the credit cards first and then for the summer which didn't really work before kind of got me in the coming from\nOkay yeah we got to break the cycle so let's go ahead and say for the summer and then let's go to the credit cards what I Would do is try to do both I Try to be by summer have the savings and have the credit card debt from last summer gone\nA that would be ideal right that that's a that's optimum so I Want to start there and how we gonna do that well obviously you're going to cut expenditures any might do something to increase your income of course the other option that mixes end of this that changes the whole equation is find something to do during those three months that creates income\n[noise] I I thought about and uh I'm I'm already starting now planning on um I'm trying to get jobs or or at least one or two jobs over the summer I worked ... hours really keeping them together it could get off of the credit cards\nAnd you're you said you're a college professor for what subject to teach\nBut this can you theology specifically for individuals with disabilities\nWow and I would guess that would also apply to athletes would have not\nNo my athletes it can be there for the sport but my research specifically for people who have the ability of cognitive disabilities and they have trouble getting out off the couch\nExercise or being physically active about more for the competitive fun yeah\nOkay I Would think an independent practice separate from your teaching where you worked hand\nA hand in glove with some people in the therapy community a would be ideal for an ongoing extra income and your jacket up a lot during the summer\nA in a sense you're you're a tutoring if you will your own students are but you're using your research and your expertise and your information that ought to be very valuable\nUh and that you could build a coke business consulting business working with therapists are that you come in and and you know supplement what they're doing and and move things alone so I I think you've got a real upside there on your income that's exciting stuff\n... with us in Pensacola Hi Wesley welcome\nTo the Ramsey show that you are you doing today better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so a little background my wife and I graduated college last year for the debt free I'm and I'm looking into trying to get a separate vehicle because right now we've been driving like you said you got a a United States marine driving a few hundred thousand miles Korea so thanks for that\nBut [laughter] I'm driving to face or whatever\nIn the car payments because I told my body as just struck me told me about a fifty thousand dollar car and I'm like eating it thought\nHey why are so my question is I'm trying to figure out what the next because I Want to get rid of the previous they don't want to replace it with a truck and I got in Nineteen sixty four Chevy back home and my uncle is willing to buy your labor for me for free\nI say I get it fixed up putting new engineer for training and stuff it's really sweet looking shot truck a problem for the is that you know it's not going to be quite as reliable it probably never to be reliable as a moderate are waking\nWhat's rod would you consider going down the road and you know stop at a couple of thousand into struck can make it you know\nWhat you know driving around or do you you know save up and wait for a year later off\nI think that trucks a keeper and it's a project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOn so I I think that previous it's going to be I hate it too I'm with you but [laughter] but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up sixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty advantage rebuilt for the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to Carver\nDue for but dual sorry for girls on it it's a beach a lot but it is a project car I mean they you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be some day um but if you want to sell the previous and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent on the truck motor and that kinda stuff\nAnd move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a who move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd like to ... get away and I want to do the project 'cause it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is with us Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh how are you\nI'm gonna do better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card for business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for

with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while and we are required basically to shape for some of those business expenses during the trip\nThat money is definitely reimbursed for the company that we're going to feed pays for that but we have to kind of that money I had a time um we'd clothes out all of our credit cards except for one for these business trips because we don't have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for the expenses\nI might have been much of the expenses run a month\nWell I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but I mean every time I go on a business trip it anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollar is covering the hotel\nAnd then you're going to get the money back then you get the money back within thirty days yeah\nOK correct so I mean we're we're we painted off an an obvious lack of using a credit card for our own personal use it in\nThe ... century losing that you need to see that one time
