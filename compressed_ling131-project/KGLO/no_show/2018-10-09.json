about your life and your money it is I recall\nThe triple eight eight to five five to five this was a strange talk radio show to talk radio show where we actually talk about things that matter\nTo real people in real cities everywhere now I Know you think a lot of that other stuff matters\nLet me tell you what matters whether you change your family tree me tell you what matters whether you get your financial act together so that you can give and do your community what happens at your house as a whole lot more important than what happens in the White House\nWe're here for you\nIt's actually what drives us in our country you do not the characters on the television\nAnd oh my God are there are some characters on the television wow ooh man scary scary stuff but we're glad you are here with us today open phones at AAA eight to five five a two to five Arab guy is with us in Chicago Hi Erica how are you\nHow to do better than others or what's up\nOn it and they didn't and then they add on about twenty thousand dollars a night ... and and I was curious I hated to upgrade or if I should get\nPlay out now I live in more shy than than calculator lying if I had to add an ad spending a little bit of that will\nGo file [noise]\nCool what's your homework or about ... what do you owe on it it's okay one of the homes on your street so far on average\nI'm Out of [laughter] okay All right so you're right into barely at the top of the market right where I write it down there and you're just not like double that average house on the street but it's one of the nicest one's\nA wacko tightly hey it's worth to Seventy and the average house on your street has been fifty five is the information you gave me is that right yeah that that puts you in a little bit nicer than the average house is that right yeah okay that's what I'm Talking about ... if you're going to spend some more money on how much more money or are you going to spend on the house\nI only got twenty but we're going to spend the ... you weren't gonna spend the whole twenty yourself okay so what are you thinking about ten Fifteen around there and how long you plan on living there\nOr if they're okay and what's your household income one okay All right so if you spend ten thousand dollars on this house you're likely not going to get it out when you resell it\nIt's not going to increase the value of a homeless at the top of the neighborhood by another ten thousand it might increase it some but it likely won't increase it by the equivalent amount it's already one of the nicest homes and stuff but the people that look for two hundred Ninety in three hundred thousand dollar houses don't drop down your street\nOK so when you price when you have a house is worth two Seventy five and he's been Fifteen more on it that is to Ninety and that's sort of you're likely not going to get your money out so whatever you're spending there is in a sense consumption is like saying I Want to go on a really nice vacation which is okay you have the money\nAnd I probably would do some of that work I probably enjoy some of that money by spending it on the house [noise] but the likelihood is if you told me your house was worth two thirty and uh the average house prices to fifty five and you spent ten or Fifteen on it then you would be like up to average\nAnd you would likely get your money out depending on what you've spent the money on what the repairs were or the re models work I probably would do some of the work just for the fun of it you know just to enjoy the money\nBut uh but we can't do it based on the fact you're going to get is going to increase the value of your home 'cause it's not likely to what the numbers you gave me Eric is on the line in Salt Lake City Utah Hi Eric welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\n... Michael trauma once I\nGot a question just started listening to your broadcast or my dad but from Steve and he's been recommended for a while that uh we've been to you in and get your financial piece of my wife and are planning to do that just finally got her on board with everything [laughter]\nUm my question is to start budget have I'm a contractor and so I get paid you know performance a per piece rate um so my my pay changes all the time after a one month we might make a thousand one of my mind for thousands or how do how do you set up by people without\nConceptually here's how you do it in the mechanically will walk us through a couple of different ways okay conservatively we just say okay what's our worst month in the next coming twelve likely it sounds like you're just five K. very like very very likely you're not gonna be below five K. in the coming twelfth grade\nAgree okay it might but it'd be very unusual now so much that the budget up regular on five K. we start with five K. coming in or going to give every one of those dollars on a mountain assignment of mission and show five K. remind us my categories equals zero every dollar has an assignment\nOkay on the five K. and so there you're going to take care of most of the things in your life\nThen the things that you couldn't get on that list but you still\nPrimarily in this case is gonna be want to do not need to do\nOr it might be one to save some money it might be one to go on a trip that might be they want to pay off some debt it's you know but it's not necessary for your living you can live on the five probably this kind of gravy bonus money so to speak above five K. we make a list of those things and we say art after our regular budget\nIf we make a dollar what is the most imports\nThings on this new list that didn't make the cut on the budget the understand\nYet they're okay and I don't care what it is you and your wife look at that and you say that's number one\nI got you say are what we made enough above five thousand to do that when you put a dollar amount decided it's four hundred Ninety dollars okay so now we made five thousand four hundred dollars and we make the next dollar what's the next most important thing the ... this month that don't have to be for the rest of your life is just put this coming up\nAnd you put it turns out that and then a three and then a four and then you read about the list in order now you have a prioritized spending plan for each dollar that comes in it already is spent by prioritization above five caves that logical tell you\nYes or no that's your concept the practical application is one or two things you can use your every dollar budget out to do all of that\nAnd just change it through the month as the money comes and just go okay we're going to set up on five\nBut as we get more money I'm all changed the income and will drop down in and will change the list okay and you can apply route to every dollar budget out or\nIf you've gotten your financial ... materials or you've got the total makeover book or any other any of the books that are having my based on the front I'm just about to have a budget forms in the back in the back is an ear regular income planning sheet that teaches you to do what I just talked to the day\nBut you can go to yell at me when I just described it's basically it's your Saturday morning to do list momma momma they're honey do list right momma said get it done last\nAnd what's the most important thing here is one of my car smile that's number one and then what's most important thing and after that number two we get those two things we had a pretty good Saturday but we'd like to go on the number three and so All right it just your prioritize them to do with your money\nThis is the ...\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family\nHas that and not enough savings to provide for their financial aid that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well stay at home\nParents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance since it's the most affordable way to get the right amount of\nCoverage and not break your budget go to sander dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two\nEighty to these other guys I\nPersonally use term life insurance is inexpensive and your family needs this no matter where you are in your baby steps that Zander dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two sander dot com\nQuick

you don't have that lying around obviously on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue to in the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're an entry level um the simpler versions of helicopters my all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more\nAnd so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah

some MOH but it's a ... I don't make any money doing um a traumatic minority but I'm just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies cost and this was not going to cost you and it's actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty dollars much of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years the cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return we promised to work there three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a pilot that\nYou know that much intensity uh sometimes I an employer will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board of trouble finding the health in that area\nOf destruction [noise]\n\n\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage can tell you if\nYou could save some cash each month they've helped thousands upon thousands of my listeners keep more cash in their pockets through smarter mortgage\nI Want you to call Churchill for your check up and see if you can lower your monthly payment or better yet she how you can pay off your house or but think about it what could you do with your money if you didn't have a mortgage\nCalled Churchill a triple a loan to hundred AAA ... two hundred or visit Churchill mortgage dot com for your Churchill checkup that's AAA loan two hundred or Churchill mortgage dot com\nThis dissipate advertised about ... won five nine one ... consumer accent dot org equal helping lender seven sixty one old hickory both heartbreak would Tennessee three Seventy five to seven\nYears old yellow goldie ... cage yellow special to President Trump is under the federal building up all the routes yellow gasoline plenty of addicting Bridget out that all\nCurrently a gasoline with ten percent ethanol maybe but any time of year in the United states the oil industry has to preserve rules that have prevented higher percentages of ethanol from being added to gasoline during the summer months\nYou know last night about year round he Fifteen sales that President Trump firmly on the side of corn growers ... expected to how his administration to promote ethanol during the rally in council block this evening radio Iowa I'm OK Henderson\nAdvocates that of course they all are praising Trump for making a major announcement about the fuel on it today and just finally saw the executive director of the hour we'll be able to show us yet\nAnd we like each for each one restriction would come back in the play so President Trump a United States next summer\nJob or next year I wanted to go to court to try to block the labor ...

best the best fucking all star team that's pretty cool\nLaura's with us and you just don't tax us Hi Laura welcome to the debt Ramsey show\nHi how are you better than I deserve what's up\nHey I have all of that going to have a real strength training five years old and I\nI was offered to buy that I felt like I didn't think there are a lot and I have come back and let that go out and all that will have to take that for four\nHundred and eight dollars an hour and a temperature down fat and now I get all of my own age thirty thousand dollar pay that cash cats but\nUm but I'm just wondering if it's something that divide rather they start out because I Know how to start up with that stuff like that and I want to get your opinion\nWell\nUm what I have found is the number one cause some small business here is cash flow and cash flow is restricted by primarily to things that cause businesses to fail that don't take care of their tax bill and they get by on their taxes and they go into debt number two\nAnd so um you you increase your probability of failure ten ...\nIf you go into debt and do this and I have to tell ya I personally don't borrow money for anything and I have never in Thirty years of doing this show advise anyone to go into debt to buy a business ever and so I'm not going to do that because you have to pay this bill was almost clients leave the next month or not\nAnd that could bankrupt you\nIt could be fairly easily actually because you basically don't have any money\nAnd so I don't know what the value of an insurance agency is better value you know you've got a a you know you've got a book of business the book of business has a value and it has a um upper systems right I mean the number of people you lose two attrition or don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance and an industry it might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you a salary\nFor what I can tell you would make three hundred and ten thousand dollars in the first year\nThat profit I don't have advocated book yeah profit out after the rent is paid the secretary has paid every body payroll after I ran a fair point after ensuring\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years now\nThat we kind of tricky it's like\nWell if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three Dan you live on nothing you\nPay it all back I think I can tell you oh okay\nWell then it takes three years yeah All right but uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like that about four times the net profit but there is that does not include having paid you\nAnd so there for a factor that's a fairly normal appraisal race so they're not ripping you off on the price of a but I Would not going to have to do it I Would start your own\nAnd then when you were going to make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own about buying out another practice you could say about the money and do that the viewer might into ten and through every three years you could save up and buy a business it's worth six hundred right\nRight and so I mean that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies are buying out of a stand alone but I I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old if I was forty five years older perspective I personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room was never bought a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here and it's a two hundred million dollar businesses seven buildings\nSo uh but we started on a card table in my living room and all the bumps and bruises along when I'm really glad I didn't have any that Vicky is whether it's in Orlando, Florida Hi Vicky how are you\nHow to and it's like if you are to what's up\n[noise] okay or trying for for
