to prove people wrong and I think it's good to be able to use motivation and and whatever and get them excited to play and keep after when they're not having success\nHuh that's that's really important especially when a white gets difficult after high school and they're into college or they're out in the in the workforce or they're in the military\nBeing able to look back on their experiences if they've gained some persevering through some resiliency and develop some of those work ethics and work habits um to uh to fight through difficult situations I think they're going to be in a good spot\nYou know there are a lot of lessons in the game and when you when you really think about it in ten years from now they're filling out a job application someplace there isn't a line that says how many wins did you have in your senior year in high school a month there are some of those things you're talking about that will take them for their and their job\nYeah I just think you know when you look at the game of football there's so many lessons that can be learned because uh any given night there's a lot of things that are outside of your control and\nUh we talk a lot about being able to respond to situations and when the vents happen um you respond and that kind of determine you know the direction that the outcome is going to be in and and like we talk about you know we can do everything we can to put ourselves in a position to succeed but there's always that X factor\nThat we can't control that's part of that uh that formula that equals our outcomes and\nUh they know that when they go on the job interviews down the road that you know there's other applicants that might be as qualified or maybe a little more qualified addict can only do what they can do to put themselves in a position to get that job or you know even in relationships are there is always you know other people that are pursuing relationships and\nAnd how they approach a you know talking to somebody or\nUm how they approach treating that individual um they can only do what they can do the best of their ability and\nAh they just have the the the other factor is kind of play out but there's a lot of life lessons out there and you know we talk about those after games and after practices and\nUm they're definitely learning and and I I find that these guys will find a lot of success\nA post high school well let's\nLet's look back last week I mean your your kid battled you and I were just talking before during the pregame show there were some good moments in there were some not so good moments a week ago I never missed opportunities left out on the field\nThat we talk on Monday during film all the different opportunities that we had and how many points we'd Salt Lake we left out on the field just due to mistakes that we made a mentally and and just didn't execute and a ... just being able to see that if we do things correctly and we value the football\nAnd block and and carry out her assignments or how much better we can be offensive lead but also on the defensive side of things too I mean if we just make sure that\nUh we have the proper laminate the snap or we don't get beat as deep a as often you know so sometimes we just wind up a little too closely receiver and what their speed you got to give a little bit more room otherwise they're going to be leaving behind and you know just seeing if we executed our our ally Amazon we practice all week and\nUh we executed at that at that level that we hadn't practice that these guys I mean a lot more situations define success on the field and now that's just part of the learning I'm as well\nWell we've talked a lot about this to the schedule you guys play it's a\nReally pretty incredible you played some very good football teams [noise] um I don't know how many people on that you find this year that hasn't been ranked in the shots and in their class if you will and it is no different this Johnson team this week this might be the best\nYeah just weekend and we got we're going to see some of the best competition and that's part of being and for a football and uh definitely being on the western side of the same with the CIA Mel schools we know that we're going to see a lot of top teams and\nYou know it's a it's a situation where I hear a lot of people talk about well what if you know ... ... said he wasn't for a uh how we compete and and the schedule might look a little easier and\nUh you know the current reality has worked for a and we might be one of the smaller for schools but we just have to make sure that as the situation is difficult for us ah we match our preparation onto that difficulty level we actually have to work harder\nAnd executed a higher level um if we want to compete and it's not a situation where we look at it and it's difficult so we went from it if it's difficult and gets difficult we have to raise our preparation and a change our habits and in our work ethic if we want to find success as one of the smaller for eight teams\nI was looking at the roster and this Johnson football team they're going to ... they've got big kids um skilled people are rolling up some big numbers and and beating other good teams are only lost his years has been to the Dow like Catholic and I'm a need to do a lot of things well\nYeah there are well coach a team or
