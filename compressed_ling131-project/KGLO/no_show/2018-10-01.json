we're at October I Know domestic\nAbuse awareness month again it is we're gonna keep doing it until it stops all those maggots up yeah which is good so what are some of the things we're going to be talking about this month what's going on\nWe have a lot of activities happening this month to help raise awareness and the big thing we want to talk about is our event this Friday it's called the remember my name where north Iowa domestic and sexual abuse community coalition honor the memory of Iowans that have lost their lives as a result of domestic violence\nUm we gather together and um read the names of individuals who have been killed as a result of domestic violence and honor their memories and sharp support for the victims out there today\nAnd this is this is different location tuition and we're we're holding it at the same places last year the city room to making the public library we've changed the location from year to year by the defense of different places I was thinking it was amusing that square or anything\nThat was at the mall you ask them good memory uh yeah it's been a couple of different places and like you say at some point in time it'll be so nice we'll just have an October picnic and and we were worried about this stuff\nWe would love that but you're right I Hope I Hope that happens in two thousand Nineteen\nBut at the Mason city a public library Mason city room at work you have to be\nWhich is a nice place to hold and it's beautiful at the parking everything for people to come absolutely ... at a get when they come what would they experience but what's the\nWhat we're going to start the day off right at noon with a free a light launch a provided by the coalition so it's a way to get people in the door and about twelve ten and twelve Fifteen will start a program and then we'll have a we'll have readers that will read a\nAll local a scenario scenarios of cases like actually you know rent or we we can't read all the names of the victims that have died and domestic violence but rather take all the local cases and will reduce the number of\nThe victims ah since I started evening specific back in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd I would say that it's all the time when you come in and talk about this it's kind of scary isn't it ah the way these numbers though are we talking about and mentioned lightly we'd like to see this go away but it's not\nIt's not um ... and the one thing that troubles me and the sheriff and everyone else that works in this field is domestic violence homicides are absolutely positively one hundred percent preventable 'em and every time we talk to family members after there's been a homicide\nSomeone knows something that's been happening you know there's been abused and the relationship um this isn't just a one time heat of the moment angry\nI shot my wife I mean that just doesn't happen it's a history of violence and we we need the community we need family and friends to step up and help protect victims and and hold offenders accountable and\nMy dream is that we can hold offenders accountable without utilizing law enforcement you know if there's early intervention um family members talking to family members and friends about hey you're controlling behavior it's getting out of hand\n'em in and get people doing the harm help early rather than light\nYou know you hear people say all the time well why why did she just walk away you know that you know uh and that sometimes easy to say from the outside but we're not that intervention without somebody talking through that whole process that person feels pretty alone in that that old deal\nAbsolutely it in the the other pieces and when when people ask me that question the first thing that I think in my head is um why doesn't the other person just tap nice\nYeah act like how we were all taught to act in kindergarten um but but the flip side is many times up people love their partner you love your husband you love your boyfriend or you love your husband you love your wife you don't love the behavior and\nJust like other types of behaviors you want people to change 'em you know maybe maybe you eat too many French fries and your wife wants you to stop 'em it's really hard to stop now\nWhich I did I I Want to turn it into something\nThat everyone can think about you know I think every year I should go on a diet and then I said I played a ... and and they don't um because\nI like to sniff it at all and I'm not trying to equate this with weight loss or unhealthy eating choices but um domestic violence is a choice for the person doing harm and that's what we want people to know and it's not a choice for the victim\nSo some kind of a trigger that have um a lot of times yeah just maintaining power and control in a relationship what we also now is I mean it seems logical we'll just leave\n'em when we read through the scenarios um every year at this event and we talk about the stories so many times um it's after the people have left\nIs when the homicide happens people are doing exactly what we tell them to do they they've received protection order and it's called law enforcement and there's no contact order in place and a lot of times that's when people doing harm will escalate and losing control of its relationship so I have to step it up once\nSo it oftentimes after people and everything that professional tell them to do\nUm the that the offender still\nActs of violence against them [noise]\nYou need to know in advance about coming to the event on friday for example is that something you need the urge to be the owner just show up to ...\nWe we want people to just show up just gone we would love to filled the room and have standing room only and scientists space for next year it it

doesn't allow the the the first read to to move up like it's supposed to and the thing is just range of motion is look over your shoulder and then uh bring your head forward into it you don't have the range of motion you should write so there's a lot of issues there that are that\nCan happen with just having that that had for a\nDoctor Robert very won the Nobel Peace prize Nineteen eighty one with his uh\nResearch of the brain that Ninety percent of the stimulation nutrition to the brain\nIs generated by the movement of its mind so if we're doing things that are generating and I'm I'm not allowing the range of motion her spine happen that brain isn't going to get the the stimulation and nutrition at ...\nI was ... it affects them is this correct absolutely went after the joints moving allowing the the the just to kind of thinking back up absolutely can and yet we train them this fine reaching the muscles or help bring that to the next ... should be\nLike you're talking about when you think about it really there's a whole generation coming now but I pads and and all of these tools the phones and computers of sorts that they're reading with everything on their last\nAbsolutely as a big thing that I'm I'm seeing my office it's in my ... years of practice seeing a lot more teenagers having this uh um the curvature is fine or the next isn't it backwards curve is more of a a very straight curve occur but\nStrengths fine and I think that's caused from a lot of these cell phones or we're having some big issue down the road ah so\nDid you talk with the two along with any adjustments and\nSo forth when due adjustments and then the work on um sufficient rehab exercises to help\nKinda strengthen the muscles in the back of the next ... instructions that they can do to to kind of help offset that as well\nAs there's always an exercise that can that can help future I and I was looking at I just didn't find a ball\nThat are that are willing to share this week\nI I I I did go shopping at a couple of stores and they just ran out of time but I but I find the little one I Know that I not big enough I got to get one of those great big one and you know I noticed that when I walked in here today and you didn't have the law that\nYou're going to see it some day I where are you going to take care of the er this is where I'm we talked about posture last year in\nThe workplace business we're really starts to really start to uh you know help you out down the road as having a better posture as you're sitting there at work you know bringing forward doing different economic things to say OK elves\nNow you're seeing companies that have and most companies are cutting back on the amount of benefit they will provide for an applicant I used to be that you might be able to get a contract that has a a poor lights that anymore you're looking at perhaps five years has been up that maybe a little bit less than that\nAnd then how they're designed a actually determines the amount of premiums that person's going to pay I mentioned cautious well it's kind of like a car if you think about that pony car out that that has none of the bells and whistles on it that's kind of the base price and that's the way it is what the contract but\nThe more benefits you add on to adjust like more where do the ads on the car it's going to increase the price of the car\nAnd that's the way it is with the long term care policy so the longer the benefit the higher the premium that sooner start paying a benefit the higher the premium the the more coverage you add to it whether it's a dollar amount per day or whether it's the assisted living or the shared care or the\nOr the inflation writer which will really double the premium\nOn all of those things ah\nContribute to the cost of a policy but as far as when would it be ideal to get one the ideal would be the day before you need it but\nThat's not predictable cell\nOr the people that really need it and we did talk about it a few programs ago the people that really need is those people that have something to lose a poor people that have few assets uh the bottom line is that they'll probably be untied Nineteen or could be an titled Nineteen\nAnd a extremely well I don't think they're going to be able to find their own programs so that that middle brackets so to speak so you know\nThe middle of a letdown again we're a good business are you guys to figure out where they're at the ... all the other things they have put together as they look ahead toward retirement\nFor actually so the four pillars sell very important I think that's the foundation of our of our office we're going to make sure that no matter what happens in life that we're going to be able to take care of you and I'm Glad to say that I think we do pretty good job of that yeah you\nKnow building so and I'm One of the other things to bring up stage today is actually our last hope will help help wealthy\nSpice lay program for a while we're gonna take a little break um we got really busy season coming up for classes and um and obviously the weather during winter isn't so great in Iowa so here it would be a\nDidn't get a little yeah sometimes I mean what along the lines of classes we do have another class and clearly a on Thursday at six o'clock this one's going to be our Social Security and Medicare class you know a ... it's a wonderful class if you got\nTime to come out and check it out it's it's well worth the the knowledge you can gain\nEspecially that person is nearing sixty five and they're already starting to get bombarded with all kinds of literature and it comes in waves of information and then you'll get bombarded with phone calls also\nAnd so we can make it simple white come to find out how to make it simple and don't be over stressed about how ... what do I do when when the way when we're all what planets that's for me you know what about the drug cards you know although what else we can answer\nBut that's Thursday night Thursday night six o'clock and it's at the a little\nIt's it it's not at Central park at clear lake at that um they've got a shelter how said it's a beautiful facility actually it's right across the street from from the lake and are just so lovely to sell it and so we're going to do more of a roundtable discussion there and so\nUh you know we still have all up like PowerPoint material but I found out that you know while we can protect off of in there\nSo we do round table it's got that\nHeld it got all the way it was on it and I said yeah and the ... [laughter] shutter amount it's I've been a number of times\nReally nicely I was very late in the ... well that's good to have you on the show if they need to touch base with you at a Franklin financial how do they Richard Gere\nFacts number to call to explore one four five six four six four four doctors jak issues speech and get a get it set up a little quaint little if either of us and we'll take care of you\nBut that's just several good that's great Tim super\nHaving both at absolutely we bring an apple so an apple a day you know [laughter]\nI don't see the ... oh yeah a health ... financial services but ... ... am Thirteen hundred gay G L O\nHere just a few of the reasons why you should check out cagey yellow\nAm dot com every day\nJak three in the morning show handful of sports broadcast gauging yellow new cagey yellow farm new Tim Fleming morning show bay you'll also find links to political national new world news business news\nWhether ... whether I call at ... am dot com and plenty more check it out today\nKim flooding in the morning on AM Thirteen hundred cagey yellow\n[noise]\nHey I'm certainly not a bill oh we can help while the spice of life well I imagine the flu shots were coming they decided she was going to come in today so she could there here so I was getting ready\nSay hello good morning how are you good how are you doing\nReally good but yeah it looks like you are you brought two shots [laughter] or who votes for you to at least back to ... I certainly can sure sure can at least I'm ready you cry I Believe\nI'm not going to go out of I've probably won't even feel like that that's a good\nOne of the things that the reason we're doing this on the air so we can tell people it's really it's so easy to go to\nHide the east and get a flu shot and do that at the um the pharmacy area and um there's a\nPrivate area where does it does it feel it they still think I saw it go in a lot of them I really\nDidn't hurt a bit the name of the best though I mean yeah I didn't feel it\nOh so you're getting a band aid on the time I ...\nYou know a little bit of it yes or no notice\nIt very easy I mean come on it anytime you don't need an appointment\nLittle simple form to fill out I mean I think it's really a couple of minutes to fill up\nThe yeah yeah because you kind of a questionnaire and you do need to make\nSure that all of that kind of stuff is up to speed it up and all that comes to have you done a lot of these already\nYeah yeah ... ... and ... and then the other question I have as much earlier than normal it seems to be er no\nNot at all no we actually um we started feeding our flu vaccines in middle of August I recommend as early as possible there have been reports of people getting the flu already in August mhm so it's out there already the earlier the better because it takes a couple of weeks to build up your immunity even after getting Maxine\nDoes it help mhm okay and then and then so you get the vaccine and you're good to\nGo for or is there is a time limit on how longer it's like how long is that I was in fact she left the whole flu\nSeason so it's good until next year the flu shot out of it covers you for the whole year\nSo it's ... it's probably the strongest obviously through the winter months yeah\nYeah I mean it doesn't taper off after they're but they're earlier you get it the better protected\nYou are for the winter months okay yeah well\nIt and for you guys you're you're in a similar situation than for me you're around people all over the you don't walk around the corner without having somebody cough or sneeze\nOr touching hurt after or anything so uh it's everything [laughter]\nWashing your hands yeah very either got it ... oh my\nWell I got wives are a little by little but how do you stay away from it and really\nIt's really not such a way to work with the public\nAnd even I mean it's a little more prevalent in the winter months because we're around a lot more people in a closed environment\nAs opposed to be worth up to it no cool\nAnd I just got a choice that you'll see her man I don't that's why I'm not like what is that you have to just wipe your car\nLike a lot on your to live in\nA very good yeah I'm right in your writing ironically\nI said I Would do the left or which is the [laughter]\nBut I Will I Will move the microphones and all that kind of stuff yeah I didn't feel\nOld but yeah I Know and it's a really it's\nPretty simple to do right took you let them [laughter] yeah\nAnd I mean I'm not even going to scream although I attend you're really funny about it\nUm but that's pretty simple other oh that's it so I drink a band aid\n[laughter] probably I've

five\nThat's AAA eight to five five two to five thank you for being here Barrett is whether it's in Gainesville, Florida shirt off those are my beret how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up hey thanks for taking my call me and the wife or twenty five and twenty seven when we moved from San Antonio Texas game developed like a law school here\nUm and I'm getting a scholarship we have zero that um we currently have fifty thousand in the bank about forty five thousand in retirement\nUm and we're taking Fifteen Percent of the wife's income and putting it into retirement but after we do all that um we kind of have about like zero not quite there but very little for that on when I was wondering how much should we be allocating to join our time years until I get a beep or tougher\nUm three years is it okay to eat in to our savings a little bit or should we be living like for college students\nIt's up to you I mean what are your goals and where do you want to be you're kind of writing to horses at once I mean her careers up and going and obviously she's making some money or what is her into\nUm she's making about fifty five\nOkay and obviously that's carrying the water for you guys right now and so you can take two approaches to it you can say do what you're doing right now I live like\nYou know Fifteen Percent going into retirement and that is heating up money that would be used for fun um or or you can just say you know we're in a a transition time while I'm In law school and so were you know we're really not walking the baby steps right now we're just going to be on hold\nAnd her incomes going to be used to make sure I get to law school and make sure you know that we enjoy this time here in Florida and then when I come out then we'll be what both incomes will be game on when you can take it either way or you could take anywhere in between if you want um\nYou know obviously the more you live like no one else the more light or you live and give like no one else obviously a by right and and so those are ... there's the choices you do um the the point I'd make a good idea at the good part of this discussion is you're actually thinking about it and whatever you do at least you're going to do it on purpose\nThe the danger of backing that retirement off substantially and a ... is that you might not ever go back to this\nAge you know you got to really commit to if we do that so that we can quote unquote have fun while we're here or enjoy our time in Florida or whatever the phrase was if you do that you have to really almost writes herself a letter and both of you sign it and blood that says in two years it's game on them\nYou know when you come out of law school pass the bar\nSettling in the new location okay now Fifteen Percent or walk in these baby steps and we're going to do this right if you're going to do it you have to commit to really going back to it that's the danger of walking away from it is it may it may come back\nYou know you might not ever get back in the groove again that that's the scary part\nI'm so into either want you're ... you're not going to be broke you're going to be fine as long as you pay attention it's it's all about intention our money\nHey thanks for the call Glen season Daytona Beach I quit she welcomes Ramsey show\nThey thanks for taking my call sure what's going on so we saw a couple properties and we have about five hundred thousand dollars in a bank account on from the sale of that\nAnd we want to use that money to pay cash or a home good he won't are not going to be buying a home how ugly for maybe three four years dry and so um we're just mentioned right now he why inquiry relocating\nUh because we [noise] we filter properties that we weren't living at it with US law Honda weaker I only had it when I got a rental property\nWe live downtown like for our situation out and we don't intend to eat here and that's location in three years but we don't want to buy like a primary residence here\nBut we won't be leading on\nThis it's just that changes your bottom eighty right guy so I mean you've got really about two years you got to be really really starting to pack furniture\nWe're okay so what do we deal with it in the meantime what vehicle should we put an end uh what's your household income [noise] um like over three hundred acre\nRight well obvious that there's two things you can do there's no middle investment OK you can put it in a savings account and money market account is ... or more than half my real close to the to something like that and it's going to nothing\nOkay but it's going to be safe and and you can do that or you can put it in some good mutual funds the conservative type of mutual funds and it could go up and if it goes up ten percent that's fifty thousand bucks a year that does that three times as a hundred and fifty thousand bucks\nRight mhm during the three years but it could go down ten percent\nSure you could lose ... fifty thousand bucks if you can emotionally handle to lose fifty thousand dollars in order to get out the possibility of gaining a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to go through your period of time you can invested in mutual funds are probably something like a growth in income fondest what I Would do\nOr or maybe just don't know maybe just a no load index fund where there is no commission and you're just park it but you've got to be able to handle it financially you can handle the risk of that losing ten percent mhm because you know you could recover making three hundred grand it's not going to run your life right\nRight but uh but emotionally if you can't\nThen you know you don't take that ride you just let it sit there so you're either going to earn almost nothing\nTake a risk of losing fifty to get out the possibility of making one fifty all now ... during that time it used to ask yourself that question the other thing you could do it split the difference\nYou can put half of it in a money market and take the other half in and put it in a mutual fund you know and take the rain and that would cut the risk and a half but it also cuts obviously those returns in half those numbers I'm giving you a half\nSo uh in my situation I could afford the risk and I can emotionally handle the risk so even though it's a short term I might park it\nAnd I'm In some mutual funds but if

market if you can take some risk split in half of you can take a little more risk and it's all emotionally you mathematically can I all the rich\nI'm Sorry you could go to a ... you know probably just go to an index fund an overload index funds you got no commissions you just pop it in their whatever it makes it makes its exactly what I personally would do with it but again I'm In a position mathematically and emotionally that I can handle that that ride\nAnd if it goes way down I'll be All right I'm not going to freak out over time I'll just ride it out a little bit so um but it was all

I guess with the whole it they'll pay you to be well the thing that you talk about it I guess how do I find myself getting work out a long way\nWe're always trying to strive to get that number and not enjoying kind of life that goes by\nYeah um\nYou didn't get there by controlling every day you got there by controlling every year and have you and controlling your your habits during the day but you did not ... your way into wealth\nAnd now that you've set this next goal to get up to eight million what's your current network right at two okay now you just set a new goal and now that you've set that go where you started spreading you didn't use to fret right no no not at all okay and all it is as you you've um\nYou you shorten your vision window to daily vision window instead of an annual or or or or every two year\nAnd show need to look further out and that'll get you looking past the bombs and then it won't control your mood I don't look at my mutual funds and I don't tally my net worth a once a year\nOnce a year I have no idea what my you know what the stock market going down this month a or up this month did to my network I Do not look at it and it's not because I'm home late or something like that I don't have time to screw with a number one but number two it would drive me bananas which is exactly\nWhat's right [laughter]\nYeah yeah it it's like you know it's a you know you're the you're the guy who in the second\nQuarter of the football game the team is down one touched down and it says if you've lost the game's not over you know finish the game and you got to walk a lot of football last you know and that's all you're just doing it to yourself\nAnd it's because you became goal oriented you became focused on it but I don't think it was it I I may be wrong but I just don't smell that there's a spiritual problem here I don't think that it's a lack of trust in God I think you just got caught up in the short term the long term am I wrong\n[noise] yeah yeah I think that that's fair credit for it you know in part of I feel like if in fact I remember in your book\nYou talk about when you click on top of the hill or you start peddle all will are a little harder I was like you feel it's so close and then they get harder even though you're closer to the top of the hill you know like a little bit of that as well\nYou know um I I think like a couple of ... if you wanted to put a spiritual limbs on it and I'm not again I don't think that's what's going on but we can talk that just because it's a good discussion for the rest of our audience to here you are not talking about but um it it helps me to remember um I'm managing it for someone else\nOkay so yeah it is the owner that I'm managing this stuff for upset on a daily basis that's his mood change does his judgment of mine management skills\nIs it depending upon how I Do in one day or how I'd do over a period of time\nAnd I think you and I both know that that means that you know our heavenly father owns this stuff\nAnd and he's more saying are you a faithful\nSteward argue a fateful manager are you a diligent\nManager the diligent prosper the Bible says\nAre you watching what's going on you are you are\nA ... ... ... and all you know the owners instructions are don't worry about today but today take care of itself you know I mean he's got to cover and if you do the principles if you follow the biblical principles of the steady\nInvesting constant\nManagement ... and looking at it that then you know you're going to get there 'cause that's what got you to to make it and they actually got you to to make is going to get you to eight million\nIt's just a matter of timing and on and so forth and so um you know I Do not\nI I just don't look short term I I I think long term and I just remember remind myself I I if I owned it I might be more upset about it but it's not mine I'm just management for somebody else and I just had hot you know that mutual when you've got to learn and do real electric [laughter]\nI guess I'm going to have to move it for you [laughter] that one pretty much sucks so we're going to move it but I mean that that's if you could kind of get\nDisconnected from it to where you don't because owners for more than managers does that make sense\nIt got it got here and that might be a little bit of that in there but I don't think it is I think all it is as you got your Donald your vision back too short and you're seeing every bump in the road and experiencing every bumping the roads that rotten over them meanwhile enjoying it are you a budgeting\nMoney uh for\nLuxuries and enjoyment\nNot not huge amounts but are you buying a toy for your wife every so often or a trip or whatever\nI Am probably not watches what she would like but uh you know we we work at the end I mean we went over the last ... the last five years she has pursued with fancy writers all of that stuff so um yeah I feel like a part of what we do\nKnow okay I'm a might turn that up a a an eighth of an ...\nOkay not eight acts one eighth of a notch okay I'm\n... years there I mean you've got two million dollar network you live like no one else so now you should enjoy your money it is one of those three things you do you give it you enjoy it and you invest it and we spent this whole time talking about investing\nAnd that's another thing to see if you're

haven't\nHit your dad wants you to enjoy it is not not not only enjoy do you want you to give it he wants you to enjoy they want you to invest it you know and all three things and you're doing all
