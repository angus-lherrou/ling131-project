AAA eight to five five ... two to five\nBenjamin is with us in Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call they sure what's up\nWell I have a question for you I'm I'm now considered trouble and my term life insurance will expire next year I'm In our cost of over for the uninsured people so one of my questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case\nI already have accidental death insurance in place so I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get term insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three why are you not ... history of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got that diagnosis removed but I've had that in the past five years of my history books have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can Roger [noise]\nWe're in the process of having them do a double check\nBroker on dry out or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more trouble in your situation so that's great and they're just ... hopefully is short lived the issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what is going to cost that shows and you've got to look at or it could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough diagnosis for life insurance really tough so I'm anyone\nThe answer to your question overall is if someone's uninsured will yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue\nUm but otherwise I mean you know statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental up as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if your term ... firing see if they have you checked shift they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nSometimes they do a sometimes it's very very expensive uh but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it might just jump way up like triple or something once you're putting them out kind of thing um so would you have like a ... year term it's run out\nRight twenty or turn when we first got married yeah\nOkay right now though that some yeah you would see you would
