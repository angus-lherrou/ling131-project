program today as we uh [noise]\nHeavily policed rain and I know that's a hell of a\nBunch of projects get down here they are like in the hopefully very near future but uh we'll talk about some of that but ah thankfully didn't rain and harvest finished a day on Saturday and there was another successful event downtown and clear like\nReally really was a in a way which kinda surprised me it didn't rain rain but it was kind of misty and cooler their son came out a little bit but it was the crowds were really excellent very brave I didn't\nWatch up and down the whole a main street from one end of the other but I I was on one and my wife had gone in the afternoon and uh\nYou know we both concluded that it was probably one of the best attended if not the best attended Harvard supposed to do that that we've ever had a lot a lot of events that you know the shape or had planned the air and you know kudos to the chamber or\nTradition company even though the whole the whole group there are a lot a lot of volunteers once again\nYou know something like that to come off you must have volunteers to carry out some of the uh some of the task there that that go with it but uh and we had you know we've got construction on there on a third street so that kinda\nHindered you know gee Jonas and was simply urged I think is down there and we apologize for that but uh I think for the most part things things went very very well and you\nSee groups of people and some of them all dressed in that same shirt or whatever and\nYou know that's that was their day to go wherever they were from to harvest Sinclair lake in uh certainly\nWill be joy tasting didn't hurt anything either\nThat seem to be a good ... uh well attended a you know people were having fun and I'm sure I haven't talked with either retailers yet but\nI Know in some places they were lined up to get into the lined up to get out and uh you know hey that's good that's [laughter] that's what we're looking for so yeah I'm a very very successfully believe that got started what back in maybe two thousand five uh\nTell someone sobering at the time I Believe and his wife were instrumental in in a part of that getting moving but now it's a it's really expanded and like I said earlier takes takes a lot of help chamber help as well as the volunteers to pull that off\nAnd that was the only thing going on on mainstream clear like over the weekend of course some day we were both at the ah\nA grand a terrible leader who uh you know it happens it's been unveiled I guess this was just a terrible thing to recognize the completion of the freedom rock ... county which is placed right there in the same block at city hall is in and a big day gathering for that and for those that\nDidn't know what the freedom rock was all the outdoor who was painted on the Freedom Riders who attended that meeting they are definitely got a good history lesson\nThey really did and and uh you know and that that first came about I thought wow how is this going to play out in the butt much credit goes to the community of a\nA um might get in and around\nAndrews in gene minutes and uh they really put their heads together and got once again a\nLot of people to help and lots of donations or which was neat in Florida that but it's placed right now at the corner of Maine and in a\nIn a street really a beautiful location for that freedom rock uh gardens that have been a long way or the or\nGene Madsen in life really worked very hard all summer long and they have for a number of years to plant and maintain that I Believe they get some help from one of the banks are with regard to the planting but that was the location that will determine some may remember that there was a\nBeautiful Christmas trees there and I came back from being gone several days and and really didn't notice that was going on until a week or so later and I asked the officers personnel their city hall or\nOr what happened to the tree and I said on the air here he just noticed that's gone it's been ten days now I said well sorry about that but they go back in history on that one I I Believe that\nJean and his wife bought that tree than it was about a six year old a spruce or whatever whatever evergreen a it was and put that in there\nAnd they've gotten so big and you know even the Christmas tree lights from way back in the beginning when they did planted were embedded so far in that you couldn't get them out then there were some wires up above so\nAnyway that that got taken down and that begins a place for their freedom rock and the freedom rock is it is a\nReally the the artistry on that is due to a re ... could be called Baba and he's really kind of a slender guy but he said when he was born his little chubby so we had decided to come up with this guy but he's just a fantastic uh artist or\nYou know an unbelievable talent or any of my calling was scholar do because he does he does a lot of research on what goes into that painting that goes on that right now ours happened to be a sixteen ... piece of limestone\nPiece of land that they really represent to perhaps in Sunday's satellites off I was so doing\nYou know they are required to have a detention bond for water and soap pipes replaced and so on to go in\nTo a detention bond that would be on the county conservation property or which was just north northwest of the one vision property\nAnd that that that was what kind of brought up the the concern about what size pipes are going to be used as an Eighteen Inches on forty and you know there's going to be going out there and\nHow how are things going to be handled flow of water you know with regard to a a large storm the they always refer to the you know if there was a hundred year storm [laughter]\nThat's kind of interesting I think we've had about five of them is you know but a lot of them anyway the or you know how how is all that and and the White House you know what if we did this and where's the water is going to go on\nDrainage district forty was a part of that and\nHow many people know it was somewhat new to me but you know all of all of the owners along property owners along that drainage ditch\nBecome a neighbor's so to speak and so the neighbors really weren't consulted\n'em by one patient a they one vision thought they were they offered at meetings and so on but anyway well it all down they never did get together and so that was the\nFor a week ... if you will in which they said the council and say okay we'll wait to act on that pie and Z planet until you folks have gotten together and and sorted out and gotten in agreement with how that's going to be having somebody did\nThey they got it worked out and what do you do believe past the planning and zoning\nA\nLand that was submitted for five weeks earlier and I do believe things are on the move now to continue to go\nUh one other thing that was mentioned in that data council meeting or talked about was reviewing some of the city parking lots maybe forty Nineteen I\nKnow one day comment simply Bush made that city hall park him I definitely needs a little attention and maybe some of the other parking lots are least department parking lot as well maybe yeah the police department\nParking lot city parking lot or the library parking lot and senior\nCitizen down there on a first avenue south those those for a\nParking lots I don't know when the last time not in my time anyway when they were when they were done and so that that I think the bits will go out on that in January sometime in spring though so\nThe researchers and in some cases like the city parking lot and I don't think there's a light out there a parking lot light like we get them it was one of our city council meetings it's it's certainly isn't light out and you know I Would be appropriate I think to have some light for safety for safety reasons only so\nAh we ah\nCouncil approved that to be done and I think that a lot improved those parking lots a lot a parking lots are at a premium including like especially like harvest festival comes along or\nAny of the other social activities that we seem to have a lot of it like those parking lots are at a premium we used to have them in good condition\nAny other construction projects you want to get a share of course it's been with a with a wet weather in the last week I'm sure some of them have a spinoff often on yeah\nExactly and the you know the third street\nA north third street is being done in front of gi Joes there and we simply very strong through there and the law office and that's a that's kind of take a little while yet like you say the rain here today and\nTomorrow and perhaps you know clear up a little bit along the way but once that does that should go fast\nThat also is part of it we called the L. reconstruction there then it goes down a British dominant in order to North Shore Drive in front of former state bank and that will be completed in the same time as the peace or a a an or third street so\nThat Scott in progress and the painting out by the golf course we've got that there's going to be will be back to the sidewalk it's done from the Columbia House all the way out fairly drive\nAnd now they're putting in the paving for the parking\nArea in the right away all along there as well from the golf course to fairly dry and Larsen constructions in charge of that as well\nHe I served district there are things going on I'm trying to think we have a cultural and tourism group by sounds like they're going to be coming in to look at some of the things but they yeah granted they'd given throughout that sort of district ... yes they they have\nGiven us several great places grants and you know how does that apply to our arts or music to our historic areas as well as the Siamese that goes along with them you know we've done a lot\nThree stars plaza that's taken place uh we've done a lot around the surfers but landscaping around there are there has been so money's also overtime and given to a north central gardens\nAnd you know the historic part of that I think that they would like to explore we would like to explore that a little more with our our history too many people\nYou know there's things that you can do to get on the the historic registry of course the surface to surface on state one as well as the national one\nBut what are what are some of the pros and cons of doing that\nWell they're they're going around the state was four stops in one of them will be clear lake and that'll be at the end of the month and\nThey simply want a little tour or what have you done what do you plan to do a\nKind of like out there on buddy Holly where we said he purchased that area where I call the blue house is right by the dragon you know that will come down and that'll be an area or Siamese not just for the surf but for the surf district there and I think someday we're down the road on that quite a bit but that'll\nThat'll be a very\nUnique uh entertainment area district if you will\nThere's always questions about the you know certain properties around town about a development and I know a one of those courses the are all dangerous pre stressed concrete property and I we've kind of talked often about that um is there\nAnything about that you've heard lately or any other type of the things that you heard coming coming into town or looking around or should\nYeah well I saw some is gossip and stuff [laughter]\nAnd that is ... and other things that\nWe have a uh been working with him out of it is as solid and set in\nAnd kind of agree at this point in time but uh uh we do we do know that that I think I talked about last meeting next to thrifty weigh three and three of you I can go in there on a highway Eighteen scooters is coming in\nAnd a lotta people don't I've never heard of that but that's a drive through coffee place they're very headquarters I Believe is in Omaha\nAnd they're great number of them they're just a little almost\nLike a little chicken house there you know that your drive right by and pick up your coffee on your way to work her way home and you don't need to get out of your your car or I don't think it will compete at all with a with the our downtown cabin coffee and I think that's a\nDifferent a venue and so on and it's um it's my understanding from people I've talked to him that Omaha Council Bluffs areas that\nCoffee is very good and it's really neat place so that'll be a good edition ground shouldn't be breaking any time on that I understand that there's a a a electrical right away\nOr he just went up there and they kind of working out at this point in time but there's also the rumor that ah\nA quick star may be looking at something uh west of I ah thirty five\nOr most people know they've got a new one over in garner a smaller new one over there plus the one that they put east of ah either if I primarily or a truck stop as well\nAs

have a a ton of medical bills um and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a medical bills that I had a they stopped it was an automatic withdrawals I stopped taking out and they extend my account to\nCollections and then to a lawyer and refinance come into court but I'm just trying to figure out what\nOptions are what I Need to hire a lawyer or when I Need to do how much is on that bill a Fifteen sixty one thousand five hundred and fifty okay and what's your household income\nOr about Seventy five thousand dollars for and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills\nYeah I got all kind of a hundred dollars in the medical bills and a lot of credit card as well student loan for what's what's the total medical bill balance of all the medical bills that I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars for\nThem and my daughter just diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be counting show how we get a dollar a three and what were the medical issues are actually Hitler called ... syndrome a a carry about formation and that she was diagnosed with epilepsy\nOkay you got you got a hard time with this little girl and ... yeah yeah she's got you ever since she was born so they have a lot of things going on [noise] and how much credit card that you know\nWe're probably at twenty five thousand dollars and how much didn't want them to do that one that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars who's the doctor [laughter] um ... the teacher I like to stay at home um [noise]\n[noise] All right um\nWell what normally happens if you have a heart\nAnd you're a good person and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it rains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that was that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and the good husband\nYou guys are not paid attention to the money at all\nAnd all that means that are human but it's growing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right yeah so it was tough as it is on your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore\nI'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans if they're not already on our trip for all\nUm if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars an offer it to the attorney almost Fifteen hundred dollars as a lump sum settlements they'll take it\nOkay for the call today because we got some of them fairly call today and we said you know eat or what can we do and they just set a need to pay the full amount of course she's an attorney faith or hire a lawyer and when the court okay\nYou're going back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle is that what you wanted to wander\nCorrect what if they don't take that then you\nKeep messing with on a National Weather and messing with them because they're like listen you're dealing with an attorney you're probably not even dealing with a paralegal you're dealing with a large law firm\nThat runs medical collections through like a widget in a factory this is your life at your daughter gets that illness and the struggles it's got a lot of emotion tied to it to them they have no soul there is nothing to this thing is if you're just on a number on the page\nAnd they have a whole bunch of numbers on a package they talked to ... stop thousand people like you every single day and they give everybody the exact same script\nOkay this is not like you owe me money and I called and we would actually talk about it yeah you're dealing with a robot in a factory and if you get that yeah talking to your head when you're talking on the person on the other line it's emotional to you it is not to them\nLive\nDave Ramsey show\nShe was

Brian is with us in Kansas City like Brian how are you\nPretty good day you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo I but luckily for years and ah thankfully I did because I'm going to get through to Asia but everything last job\nI just wanted to go buy some maybe what I Do [noise] with the money I had saved up with the best thing for me what were you making a about two Seventy five low when you do for a living [noise] I was an ... an act of luxury Harvey okay what'd you lose the job\nA new management came and any back he just at the guy with the right guy though\nYou might get two or Seventy five dollars and commissions his thinking I'm at work that out okay um anyway so how much will be saved\nIf I got about one thirty and then my ... got about ... have been doing it for about five years ago max out here and then I have a juvenile properties cream clear\nI own my house about two Ninety eight on my how\nAre you married yeah okay that you work outside the home she does she makes about sixty okay All right cool how long have you been selling are based\nIn in the industry for Twenty years I was a mechanic how long enough to have you been making over two hundred and\nFive years okay\nI'd say probably three and a half making over two hundred\nSo cool [noise] um what do you attribute that wonderful income to Missouri okay\nI'm arguing if you've been around the business for Twenty years also product knowledge in\nNo absolutely out of my biggest thing because I Know how to work on my customers love the fact that I talk to their issues on motor homes that type of issue so they just love that that service that I Would give them you know\nAnd then they would tell her friends absolutely no\nOkay [noise] um [noise] is there are competing line across town\nYou know because of the high end stuff I don't have to move my family and I just love the mid west in Kansas City I just I don't think I Want to make that movie I you know I definitely could only about ...\nThat's a problem with that but I'm saying is there a competing is there another brand that what is your main competitor that's in that town across\nTown no I mean you have to go to a larger city for sure they get a competitor okay so he was our for Florida ... guys all walk on the luxury RV market in your town correct yeah okay well\nThere's two things that come to mind is one is um uh well we don't do anything with money you just you got a hundred thirty thousand larger set on it you use as little as possible you\nTurn down your budget and live on as little as possible you don't touch your for one day I don't want you to touch the one thirty that's casual we can get from it um you know you're married really really good shape financially so um you ought to be able to coast\nAs long as you need to um the trick is I don't want you to settle for something um you know making sixty thousand bucks when you've made to sixty\nUm preserved because you've proven you're worth that over more than a fluke\nOr you did it over a long period of time so we know that you have to uh\n\nUnbelievable world class skills one is you have an in depth knowledge of luxury motor homes and uh how they work and what makes them tick and how you can help somebody else to George new show on there okay that is a very narrow set of a skills\nIt really has only one application than your city and you lost that job\nOkay the second thing we know is is that you know how to sell large ticket items to wealthy people\nAnd you're very good at it\nAnd so were you for instance to shuttle\nI'm\nAsked in Martin ... or ... you would be in a similar market and the the downside is you don't know much about how they work you've never worked on\nThe curve would be but you know how to communicate serve closing the sale handle the service after the sale how a high end luxury buyer wants to be treated and needs to be treated in\nOrder to create repeat business you are an expert in there and I think that set of skills can be applied in other places would you agree grabs her I don't care if you're selling a hundred thousand dollar watches if you want to do that that's fine\nSo I just came I went to something with wheels on it because you have some wheels of motor before so you're mechanically inclined as well so maybe that's it but you know I talked to a guy that was I saw in the crowd out of high on the cars\nAnd they used to be in the um recruiting business she used to sell a you know recruit people for jobs\nAnd it's just similar skill set because we were dealing with high on the executive placement and then he's dealing with a executive placement into cars and it it's the same set of people he's dealing with this thing they think the same way you know how to keep that kind of person moving unhappy\nAnd I think if you think if you broaden that out that wide if it's if you're back off your pan out with your camera angle you'll see that I think you're going to be fine so I
