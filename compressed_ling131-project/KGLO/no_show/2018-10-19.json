you could see that we played with our hearts and we really came together as a team that wasn't necessarily just a couple of big plays that we'd bust we every time we step the ball we would really get after and we would try and do as much as we go to rich now\nSo or going into a game like tonight now or are you going to the game plan yourself so that you can help guys coming up we'll talk and then

looking at houses and found either why the court should I be out of state yet come up with you know twenty percent down\nFederal so forth so I don't have the cash right now so we were it\nWas and I pretty much know the answer is but [laughter] take it out [laughter] I Hope that early on and and uh for a down payment sell her house every day off yes July ... up there\nOne of interest rates went up in the real estate market froze and they couldn't show you how\nWell I understand there's a lot of risk here and that's that's kinda my fear is you know rates go up shoot up get cell or how to sell

you know what would go up there with no mortgage\nYeah well I you know it's difficult and there there's not a ... something's going to be difficult\nAnd I don't know you just have to choose which difficulty you want you want the difficulty of the risk of the debt\nOr do you want the difficulty of a double move because you show your house or you have the cash to buy the house from Georgia\nUm and so you end up renting somewhere for a little bit or or something like that 'cause you're caught in the mental there for a minute I'm that's paying the but uh but it's also about to get stuck with

people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash have to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding you\nIt finds them for you\nIt's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively invites them do apply\nSo you get qualified candidates\nFast and right now my listeners contrived zip recruiter for free at zip recruiter dot com slash Dave that's the zip recruiter dot com slash Dave zip recruiter the smartest way to hire\nThat my wife write the check to them have them come over and over\nAnd we would write them a check for the balance of what what they did ... how do we didn't we didn't find them and it seems simple I mean we know if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptation then using the honey I might not be as bad as the greed and it'd be in my opinion to be more proactive to solving this official\nMuch from a non thousand dollars\nRight the Edie Henry you right now what's your network out what's that what's your net worth\nA bruise um [laughter] I don't know five hundred six hundred\nOut your household income [noise] uh I'm thirty maybe okay right and\nLet me tell you that here's my opinion this is all your fault\nMy fault yeah OK you loan people money that we're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which would you long right family money right you're the one made which I mess\nI okay I take your job now and trying to correct it they're not making it worse yeah and so I'm Wondering you\nCould say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot actually giving you money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right and she she believes that\nThat we should just be trusting mail check to them and then they'll reimburse that\nEither ...\nOr ... that's my you know\nThey're not going to completely ridiculous assumption\nThat is not going to happen\nYou mail a check them you're never going to see this money and then you have to try to speak to your own children over money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family member of money it's all your fault [noise]\nSo if you want to point if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do this again\nThis is absolutely ludicrous you're asking for all the trouble caused caused every bit of that [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each has dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die and that does happen there will be eating would be destroyed paying for the mortgage\nUtilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for educational retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance\nJust go to Zander

profit\nCan we do some of the money from the sale of the house in for them to into the emergency crime in order to bring that up to date and then put the rest toward the house or how would you want us to go about doing\nI'm confused why would you come in short\n[noise] um just because we need to save up for some other things or she needs a car before we move out of town um and just with the money we be cutting in there and we'd come up maybe just a little bit short before you want to move but we do need to [laughter]\nUm\nYou can do what you want to do I mean you're growing up you're allowed

song\nAnd I think you're asking for it um something no I don't think her ... her cars on emergency\nAnd so it does not supersede\nYour uh your need for an emergency fine now if you want to say three to six months of expenses is your emergency bonding you want to say well we're going to get to the remark and then we're going to do some purchases and we may be put up a little bit more later\nBut
