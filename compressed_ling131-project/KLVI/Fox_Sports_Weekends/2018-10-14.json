{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "Um and actually the same year I was back during doing workshops\nThis is in ... you had already been teaching\nAbout this work\nYes yes so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience suggests to be clear or ... or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a fleet paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe than than you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nOr as cars science hasn't told us that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and the norm all over\nOr their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean ... these when you are when people are going to be travels the experiences he mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to\nMap brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research and matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery were twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow they have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah herself\nWith are multi dimensional self right and have the\nKind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nAnd found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's astral into ... dot org and there are ... resources on there\nAnd I and I found as civically ways that you can take yourself into and it will be in there and you want to go through to do that there are\nLots of great things William you're talking about in a second senator your survey results the um\nBased on your sixteen thousand one hundred and eighty five sons and William came out with the um common and reported and nominate associated with out of body experience is very interesting so\nThe average of let people go through which is fantastic and you on this history and the site which I think great that you really help and give me information freely so people can\nPractice as especially if you have something going on in your life a problem on illness\nYou can connect to your own answer can you connect with people\nThat their loved ones that um can you help them with an says\nWell you can definitely contact loved ones uh it depends on whether each individual is open to whatever information you want to share but we have the ability to contact\nOur loved ones face to face\nYeah amazing experience that is incredible and and we don't need a medium to do it that every medium we'll give you a second hand information filtered through their own mind\nWell can you can also self edit we'll talk about that in a second I'm how you can do that or maybe even connected to James relatives in the right Matt I'm dying to see um [noise]\n\n\n\nAre in sports were selling sex is online and on the air news on science he owned by whom I and I hardly\n[noise]\nAll these conversations are so premature in college football where leading up to this last week it was hey hey could\nCould in on beating Notre Dame be left out of the college football playoff and it's like\nNo [laughter] do you expect all of these other teams to remain on blemish or they have these sparkling resumes at the end of the season no Notre Dame going undefeated is a lock for the play offs and it's not just because\nThey're this superior team or they've got this gauntlet schedule is just because these other teams are going to go down they're not going to have these on blemish records\nThat are going to knock Notre Dame outs of all you got to do when I got to do is what al Davis used to preach which is just win baby just winning and if your own blemish if you're playing power five teams unlike UCF you're going to be in the play off\nAnd you're talking about being blemish Durham blemish one team really yesterday got ... pretty good and then there are no longer undefeated and if you didn't believe that ... tigers before the game and maybe try to change your mindset has thirteenth rank LSU there for real they've got a huge win over number to Georgia in death valley an Saturday listen to this world\n\nSo they spent a pretty good thirty six sixteen and by the way now the title I think the real right now they have three top ten wins coming back after last week's Los to Florida which I thought it was a blemish than I thought maybe they're not for real but I think that's a real right now at the rose to the SEC championship has to include\nBaton Rouge Bob Tom Cruise will be the spot\nWell they're right in the mix but that team named Alabama still one's schedule so [laughter] I got to get through that got over that they already with the loss\nYeah what's that they've got ... Mississippi State they play next week and that Alabama so they got ready to test Sunday schedule I ended up ... I don't see the beauty in Alabama I don't see anybody beating Alabama I really don't\nRight but that was the biggest game of the day and that takes Georgia's margin for error and makes it zero in terms of making the playoff they've got to run the table and when you look at the next three weeks Florida at Kentucky Auburn was it three ranked teams\nAnd then to get to the college football playoff you'd have to win the S. E. C. championship game which most likely will be against Alabama\nThat is tough to be able to run the table they gave themselves no margin for error but you look at LSU defense they played lights out they played excellent defense against the tough Georgia team and winning by twenty points man not only did LSU when they won convincingly\nYeah they'd be they'd been pretty good does tell you what another team that you've across off the list of the college football playoffs will be Penn State\nI mean I don't know how this team chokes at the end they can't close they're like they're still like the LA charges of college football they they really are they can't they can't close it out at the end of the game and Michigan State Twenty one Seventeen at the end and now one last teams now with a chance to him at the college football players\nForget it immediately alliance couldn't hold onto the lead list another close game the second lowest of the year\nPenn State get this is twenty four and five in the last twenty nine games and those five lost is a bit by a combined\nTwelve points you know they've got to be going crazy they're in a university park but they just can't close it out they can't do it\nNo it was an ugly game for Penn State and that's their second straight loss in the division in the big hands so they are beyond done and also West Virginia how about them and number sixteen number six team going down against Iowa State will Greer\nWho's the highest been hopeful a hundred yards passing a touchdown and a pick\nThat's all you had against Iowa State so you give that Iowa State squad credit they are giant killers\nAnd for West Virginia to get beaten down like that\nThat that could do it for the big twelve you know their chances that it's like they have bullet you look at these teams is bullets in terms of hitting a target to get to the playoffs there just losing bullets one after another with Oklahoma going down last week now West Virginia going down good luck getting a team from the big twelve in the playoffs now\nWell I'll go one step further yeah it was a heck of a winter they Ames, Iowa last night for coach Mike Campbell the second year coaches Iowa State thirty to fourteen of West Virginia but if you're a West Virginia right now the ... they got the rest of the way they got Michigan Wisconsin and Iowa remaining on their schedule so it doesn't look too good for West Virginia it really doesn't\nKnow no not looking good at all that was an ugly last it was that there were less than six minutes to go in the game West Virginia was down by fourteen points they're backed up way deepen their own territory its third Nineteen they took it the lay of game\nWhere you should be in a hurry up off and just ... minutes to go you're damned fourteen point the lay of game\nNot only were they bad they were disorganized that was a complete meltdown by West Virginia last night but like you said give Matt Kaplan I Would say a lot of credit played great defense last night and to beat down and number six team in the country yeah take your hat off to them\nI Do if I had a had taken a fairly liberal I'm happy for them happy for I was saying as well but I'm happy with that we have a big big\nFootball day today and the national football league oh we're going to go through it's like a fine tooth comb beginning in about ten minutes because

Bengal game for over maybe Fifteen hundred to two grand which pays basically almost for their entire season ticket package and systematic\nAnd that's what happens that's how great those steel affairs are that's great they travel it's kind of crazy I Know but that's what they do and this town is going to be inundated today Cincinnati will be with Pittsburgh Steeler fans with a black and gold that's just yeah it said\nDo they travel great they absolutely do it's it's amazing sometimes their home crowds are less than there are way crowds it seems like you know for seriously and I've been to many NFL games and\nI've seen the Steelers before and they are crawling everywhere\nWhenever you see them on the road and then I've seen them at home to and I'll look at them like depending on the game depending on the match if they're gonna be a lot of empty seats that always blows my mind how they can travel that well and then not have it filled to capacity every single time each Sunday you know a lot of empty seats over there but you're right on the road you well traveling oh there\nYou know why they traveled the nobody in Pittsburgh works they have nothing else to do just traveled out of jobs a lot of unemployment in Pittsburgh but what do you think\nAbout that with your bank all fan selling their tickets for that amount of change okay but I think\nThis week I think it's really weak you know but you know what it's capitalism as best as Bailey what it is but what are you going to do I do the same thing if I was just yeah I could I I Would why not go hey this\nIs a big game big game for the bangles they looked terrible last week against the dolphins and the soldiers just self distraught a oh my gosh that was brutal last week but since that he's still foreign one\nThis is the if you're going to be someone you've got to win this game you're at home against the Steelers and I don't blame anybody for saying I Can't call\nThe bangles to win the game I have to see it to believe it does seem to believe that game for the bangles have you can beat the Steelers gets five in one you're looking great in that division going forward\nWhile I Will tell you one thing you mentioned that dolphin game last week they self destructive they're up by Seventeen points in the fourth quarter because oil and it was the Bengals came back but basically it was the dolphins that blew it more so than the Bengals coming back was the bagels office looked pitiful last week\nAnd the rumors in Pittsburgh that Antonio Brown and big bang weren't getting along and they had trouble running the football and the media said they couldn't play defense fill out the window because they trashed Atlanta list with forty one Seventeen the deepest was super James Caan a rush for two touchdowns and two of the three of the best touchdown passes went to a brown\nSo basically maybe the Steelers are back on track right now we'll see\nA brown I liked that [laughter] yeah well it's man still the Steelers can you imagine with all due to function that we've seen this year and all the comments that we've heard a little bit it this week you had big band saying he would push for James Connor to still get a lot of touches\nIf levy on bell comes back\nAnd immediately I thought what happens what is sad in that Steeler locker room and publicly if they drop this game to the bangles today and they fall the two three in one\nBut you gotta buy we coming up after this game against the bangles you take a few things that would be sad that would make you say oh gosh I don't know about this team going forward right the big game it's for the Steelers to not\nBut all of the allegations against Bill Clinton had been proven Hillary's rights she doesn't intend to\nBe but she is right the allegations against her husband were substantiated Bill Clinton paid an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar settlement the Paula Jones or flowers had audio tapes of his come on to her Juanita Broderick told others about her rape immediately\nThere was a pattern with Bill Clinton and sexual\nHarassment there's no such pattern with Kevin Oh speaking of that did you hear about this\nJane Mayer part of the duo Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow writing at the New York I'm from that second story the New Yorker came out with that not even the New York times would print because they couldn't validate any of it Jane Mayer showed up at what was it the Atlantic\nThere was some kind of a convention or festival or some such thing New Yorker reporter James mayor suggested in an interview that she ... Ronan Farrow\nReported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior mayor told al magazines\nAnd her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found it so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and\nSo we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nObese you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation we get from balls the Ford or being from Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick\nI mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well then use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it\nYeah we needed to show a pattern here's\nHere's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice of the mainstream media you should have the best that and podcast\nOr should have the ... and ... [laughter]\nHey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments at a base of liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it\nAh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I'd see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society and it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one way or not in the middle of who are either trending towards the middle of the barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one more thing that\nThink it was a before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what why are they what not when what why are they what were they like when the Democrats weren't the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh\nIssue was a labor laws and um when\nYou have what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nAlready know read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah ... be network\nCyber criminals cyber bad guy is going to attack your laptop your tablet or smartphone without you even knowing or\nThey can steal your identity and you may not realize it until it's too late\nThat's why lifelike identity theft protection now includes the power of Norton Security to help protect her identity and your devices\nLifelike uses proprietary technology to help detect a range of threats to your identity and Norton Security protects against online threats like ransomware or malware and if there is a problem lifelike with Norton has agents who will work to fix it\nNow no one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime or monitor transactions that all businesses but\nNew lifelike with Norton Security provides more detection and more protection against cyber threats gotta lifelike dot com recall eight hundred and four forty forty eight thirty three years the purple coat rush\nFor an additional ten percent off your first year plus a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with and you will to enrollment terms apply\nNews at the top and bottom and mobile you our this is news talk five sixty K.

sports for a selfie sexes online and on the air news on five sixty five ... and I hardly [noise]\n\nSports ...\nThe week six NFL Scoreboard is Seventeen yard touchdown run by jak Prescott if given the cowboys it had nothing lead over Jacksonville after one the rams with a Thirteen to three lead a Denver five minutes after the second quarter Todd girlie with the town you are tests that are on the ravens have a seven\nOn his inability to make smart decisions in the red zone\nWhile you know the the one that was intercepted he joined at a double covered you got caught at five yard line he was trying to you know they play down the medical field and you know sometimes those are going to happen to the other one was the one that\nYou know I'm sure if you're Dirk cutter even if you're James when you're saying what what did I see yeah to open wide receivers uh he had a Humphries it about five yard line or who is wide open he throws it in a double covered ship the falcons player in the back pops in the air and they end up intercepting the ball the ... but you know what I mean look you know\nYou know one since one of those guys where if you got him on your team and let's take all the all the fields go away for a second but but he's always been going back to his Florida State days\nHe's a gambler and he will take the shot at the big play a lot like Brett Farr would do back when he played and so far in one sense young career or they've heard it you know the only quote the only player in the league it's turned the ball over more than he has a ... foot in the NFL was like ... now I Would add\nUp until last year with Jacksonville and the guy who have the second those turnovers during that time frame was Eli Manning but one thing all three of those guys have in common obviously if they've had very bad team since two thousand fifty\nIt's only been one year the James had a decent team around him so they'll twenty four years old and a you know he can get himself together off the field I still think he has a chance to be a really good lawyer\nTom Burnham and joining us again was on the call for the books that falcons game where the falcons you get to a victory thirty four twenty nine from salon Calvin Washington with you\nBlock sports radio Tom let me ask you this you you mentioned uh he's only twenty four year old he being Wednesday so only twenty four years old this is his last year in the contract if you were the books now we know quarterbacks aren't falling off trees do your resigned them and just hope that he grows and it gets better or do you look elsewhere maybe look in the draft or maybe ...\nYou know that that that's that's a tough one to answer and and you know what I simply don't do what I Would do I think I'd have to wait and see how the rest of this year goes\nThe issues that he has had off the field of come during the off season now you think about uh guys you know when you're when you're trying to win games and you're trying to get him to the playoffs\nAnd your quarterbacks getting suspended either for something to get off the the older stuff and he did stupid on the field of New Orleans I did that game last year when he started poking marsh on ... and the talk of the head on a plane over near the buccaneer ...\nYou know you gotta ask yourself the question can I count on this guy being my guy for sixteen weeks during the season is just two years in a row\nSo you know I don't know do I think he has the talent do I think he has this march oh I think he has the attitude of being an excellent starting quarterback at a winning starting quarterback I Do\nBut you know I tell the story all the time I uh I Do a lot of baseball as you guys do and it reminds me a lot of the old days although you know very different circumstances but it reminds me of the old days when I got to know relatively well Dwight Gooden in Darrell strawberry\nAnd you'd be around these guys\nAnd they were very engaging they were plus if they were polite they were nice guys that were relatively quiet guys to be around\nAnd you know then you open the newspaper three weeks later and they're involved in something and you're like I Can't believe that the same guy right so you know I don't know what I Would do he's put them in a really really\nTough spot 'cause you just can't count on him\nThat is true and obviously with a starting quarterback you need to count on what I mean you need him to be that leaders AOL one way of being able to count on ... one\nOf my favorite thing that I've ever heard and the guy who does the Bengals games aren't radio is a great off that's why in the NFL a guy named Dave lap the most important part of ability is availability\nWell one of my favorite line it is and and you have a player who has all account in the world but if he's not available to play for what ever reason history of injuries history of problems off the old happen\nStupid stuff on the field I'm you know if he available to your team and this is the second year in a row or when that is not\nWell we'll see how the season unfolds you're right about that will have to wait and see thank you Tom we appreciate it safe travels guys you have a great weekend I mean\nThey're joining us on Fox last Sunday football football Sunday that is\nA ... couple of touchdowns we gotta talk about the cowboys just scored and also the ravens a score moments ago

Murray ran from one fifty five and the Vikings twenty seven Seventeen victory over Arizona and the chargers roundabout rounds in Cleveland thirty eight to fourteen Kelvin and even back to you\nI Will we appreciate it thank you and it's just been one of those days even we're going back to back to back talking to people who are calling these games right now is our man Charles Davis who was that the Panthers at Redskins game Redskins get a victory over the team I picked it represented in a sea in the super bowl and I was in her phrasing myself on how regular pick that was where there's\nA but they do fall and the Redskins were able to do this or get this victory when they really needed it\nAnd the defense came up at the end big when the Carolina Panthers had a chance to win what was the victory akita victory for the Redskins Charles\n[noise] getting out of the gate fast guy I mean you take a look what they've done this year go back to the Arizona game they want to go back to the Green Bay game that they want to check out today\nThey leave from the front Jake route and told told us when we had them before Green Bay we aren't aren't running team we are not come from behind team but he didn't say that with a lot of uh how would you say praise and his voice\nYou know he loved to have a team that he feels like make a return and pick it up late but he has not seen that from his ball club that was getting off the bat starts well check out the numbers against Arizona Green Bay they got off to start winning and today they got up to a fourteen and nothing start so when they do that\nThey are different ball club make you chase from behind it and they play a whole lot better than they did that to Vegas Carolina\nI talk about how important are Adrian Peterson has been to them in their three when when you look there are three wind he's had a you know an average of a hundred yards rushing in those three I mean it's just feeding him the ball really takes a lot of pressure of Alex Smith how important is he to this team\nHe's very important to them and it's actually been a little bit of a surprise I don't know how many of us thought that when he signed with Washington\nThat he'd be able to be the bell cow that we would look at baking that over sixteen games he's going to make this and of course you know how he is he hears that and it gets crazy it's like the ... in front of a bowl the charges\nAnd you're exactly right I mean Ninety six yard when an Arizona then he comes back with a hundred and twenty two touchdowns gets green bank control that he has another big day to day so when they do that you mentioned take the pressure off of Alex Smith and and throwing the football\nI don't you know we hear the word balance all the time I don't know that I hear what this much conviction\nAnd the city as I hear what I Would the Washington team talks about the on the ballot they absolutely need it and they got it today for Peterson and it all sorts of line I think played a really nice game they remember they missed a couple of key guy Johnny ... starting to center case really starts interplay guard today again\nBecause they ended up a shovel valleys been her since the Indianapolis can't say that that makes most\nHey Charles we know you're going to go while hit you with one more I Want to go to the other side of the ball the Carolina Panthers or what what why aren't they as explosive I don't know it seems like something's missing what would you say a is missing from that often so from that team to take them to the next level\nI think that the the ability to get the deep shot where you're going to ... play that you that you're terrified you think that it's Torrey Smith\nOkay guys after sixteen years to catch in his career but we haven't really seen that from him yet he had one of his better days today I think it up catch the ball game to game but the only seven to catch up to a year so who's going to be that one Curtis Samuels back off the the injured list and he should be the guy\nBut he barely was even mentioned today I think we mentioned and bought a kickoff return\nGetting Greg also back helps McCaffrey helps but they've got to find a way to take the top officer defenses it open up more space for those guys underneath otherwise people keep stepping forward stepping forward it sort of took real grinder up a game for them and I think we had a little bit of that today it got to get someone to compress it down field\nRight Charles we'll let you go man we appreciate your joining I talk to you or hopefully next week\nIt thanks a lot I don't see ... save travel or anybody else you want to get in\nAny ... my mom my mom didn't want to the games what what'd you think mom and I got my stepfather I Know he was watching the game and went to the but the to hit on the Carolina Panthers ... it well you know you're going to be different ... the last two days later and tell him anything there quietly\nThree on the Broncos and a Seventeen and nothing you have the cowboys are up a twenty four actually I'm Sorry twenty four deaths in over the jags I Want to ask you a question about a quarter back that we have he's been ... and praise and I think he accounts I think he's good I think we all know that but\nYou talked about this earlier with James wants to me from his turnovers with Andrew Luck\nAnd Andrew Luck did not have a great game today about to turn over the team is not one in five and it's not quite as fought obviously they're not the most talented roster that's for sure\nUm but if you look at the last couple of the few seasons are here we played seven ... seven games and twenty Fifteen he was two and five next year twenty six the only place Fifteen he's eighty seven this year so far through five he's wanted for\nIt's not a good record no but he everyone keeps saying he's you know the return of John Elway and and I think we see the ability there but he's turning the ball over a lot he hasn't been durable where are you on Andrew Luck\nI put 'em right with Matthew Stafford okay right I I you know he has talent of course you have talent but he hasn't been able to connect the dots yet great early success and since then injuries\nLack of um [noise] uh help offensively\nUh in terms of weapons receiving running the ball\nOr so we've we've kind of seen them take a few steps back coming off the injury and not really having those go to weapons um that he had early in his career and\nRight now him Matthew Stafford like they're right in that you can win some games with them they have the talent they can throw the ball and get you they give it over four hundred yards\nUm but they can't take you to that next step that next\nLevel up I get better like that uh he\nI Would say he's not as explosively maybe talented but as far as winning it and kind of your confidence and they say Alex Smith too in that realm well no I Would put Alex it's you're above oh really\nYeah because he's shown that he can lead a team to victory in in in the play offs but he's yet I'm Alex Schmidt was one of those guys leading Kansas City passed and it'll look\nRight and they were up by like twenty four points in the second half so Alex Smith has taken that mix that but he\nBut I I I guess my thing was he's not as talented the ... the two guys you name a natural town just pure natural talent but as quarterback\nThe talent is one thing but being able to lead a team is another thing\nSo if I have they are both twenty three years old you're going to happen for the next ten years and you take out the ...\nOr ... you know I Would take Andrew Luck I Would I Would make sure I have a problem that GM I Would put pieces together I Will make sure that we gave this kid a dynamic running game in an office of line and you know some rock solid tight end and and like I Would do the things you're supposed to do once you lock in\nYour your um\nYour quarterback you're you're you're the face of your friends are as you do once you have him on a rookie contract then you go out you build your team\nI think the issue as you mentioned it's been a lack of talent at around him and it's similar to another quarterback although he has been able to win a championship and and have some more more success and I think he's had more town around them but there are times where we say man can Aaron Rodgers get some help\nCan air I agree with it more guys whether it be defensively whether it be running game and he's got a running backs that's just uh got wide receivers that's running back so I think Aaron Rodgers has a similar case where you say man I Know he's good I Know he's talented but if he could just get some help around\nHere but the difference is Aaron is on that are elite level he might be the best that he's three levels above you know look in and out of three and no no he's three\nBecause I feel like you get you created some levels at that point [laughter] I edited more or less yeah they got like four level like more like it was that three and then you've got air and Roger that for you to put them in like six\n... ... I Know what I'm saying is in terms of elite right it's only what it right now it's four elite quarterback from the NFL\nI'm thinking of three who's the park as we got Brady yup yup Rogers and we ... do you ever been around is it in yeah\nOkay I have been robbing runoff quite there anymore\nIn Robert Byrd if you throw for seven hundred yards in any moment\nSays the guy who hasn't won his fantasy team I'm just letting you know and it's not even about that it's about big being do look what he did today like he has that pedigree\nRight so I Would agree I Would agree with you that he has more into town\nRight on right on right on point the highlights right there no business that guy ... those type of passes isn't it come on man his ability to ... in the ... is\nA step below ... he he's below he's not elite really good but not All right I'm okay with that ah there's\nA team that is suffering and the raiders did they pay the wrong man\n[noise]\nAt discover we believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation\nThat's why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us a try we're going to get new card members of one year anniversary gift they'll never forget at the end of your first year will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar\nNo caps and they'll catch is because we know if you try us you'll like us and that's worth every penny try it and believe it at discovered dot com slash match cash back match offer only for a new car members limitations apply\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews the pro check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that Holleman minds are completely free you\nGo to ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nWith the weather in sports for southeast Texas online and on the air you saw five sixty kale vi home I I hardly [noise]\n[noise]\nFox Sports trending\nMore presented by true car online car shopping can be confusing not anymore with ... like you know the exact price you pay for your next cars if there's a true car to enjoy more confident car by experience\nBin Laden's burger is going to spread the ball around for ... or if you look I I Believe he threw the ball to\nTen different receipts\nDiverse you know I hate to to some guy here even though he caught a pass he threw a pastor was tip then he caught it himself so that counts as a target\nYeah I don't know if he was happy buddies yards do negative one yard and I think he was happy about that\nBut he was the lead in different receivers that he targeted including him so I mean to have that type of ability it's hard to to put a\nGuy you know being the number one guy when you look at a B a B is going to he's going to demand the double team so\nThat is true that anyone else has to step up and Jew Jew has done a tremendous job in getting that single coverage and taking advantage of the ... with the defense gives them\nAs absolutely true there and and that's where you going to give credit to him actually Alex I Do want to go to been talking about James Caan are of course running back we've had a lot of success this year I mean he's run the ball is caught the ball he's got a really good season thus far but been talked about the fact that hey there may be our star running back coming back and living on bill\nJames spring attack was that that gets guys going you know it it it gets your stuff that guys are being physical and um it it's a lot of fun to see guys aren't going to quit on place and ... and James I thought was he was a bowling ball today it was all over the place what a great game but you know I Know it's his last game for us so slave I was coming back but I thought he did well in his last one\nNow what is that that's a joke right I mean he's ... well because he he went last game maybe he made last game starting but that doesn't mean that just kind of can't place like Libya and has to run the ball every play so I I Believe it was a little tongue in cheek leaves back they're trying to convince me as if they're going to put them on the plane\nDo you keep ... Alex now you don't know either\nAnd that's not bad it's that he's been gone for so long now you're gonna get your value out of them make rent every freaking ball now since he's back okay now will make sure your bathroom make you run every single ball or\nOr the opposite you spy them you say come on back we've been winning some games lately with algae James counters looked like a a starting running back in his league were good without you know and again they're not going to not give lady on the ball the bell bell the ball but what I'm saying is look Connors been great I mean even on the\nRoster though he later on yeah so maybe I'm not even on the roster ... or anything\nSo I think it's a little are they I think that all the websites update you know after last Sunday and Monday rolls around I think I think it all up day that will be my guess\nBut as a still is do you just throw\nLive beyond in there and in and stop the momentum that the James who's had me that a tremendous uh years so for running a ball\nCourting Jillian Alex you do I'm with you look I'm going with the guy that has been playing well I'm going with the guy that it seems like the team is getting along with you know and it seems to be working well with\nA touchdown by the way for the rams\nAnd now it looks like a tiger early in the end zone there so now they're up big on the Broncos twenty three a case keep them in the team is not going well for them right now All right\nAh Alex Marvin is going to join us next maybe we can as Alex that do you go to a lady on bell or do you keep going to James Caan I Will do that
