{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "Important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nAnd work on them for on people for a while usually these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs ... I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel them and\nThey accumulate is in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and soda negative\nSpirits and so they are or attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whenever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening\nAnd so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clearing so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you know sometimes\nThere are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and\nThey're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have a clear it out once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut they all but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances this universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all\nNo you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which told me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on

down that bullpen haters not going to be available today for game too\nHas written Miley and Molly's I dodged can hit mileage\nYeah they can and they can they use pretty much every arm in their bullpen they being the brewers in game one just to try to eke out that game one victory I'm telling you this is a series of attrition this isn't a short you know three game five game series\nYou this thing go six or seven is going to always going to tilt right into the Dodgers favor because\nNot withstanding from game one with Kurdish are getting rough up there and a lot of it was due to a lot of errors behind them that that I make ... we all had one of the worst needed not had the greatest season either by the way just offensively as I said I'm unemployed right now not at all of it yeah but but as a hitter he was excellent on a plate not so much\nSo I Do think it was one of those maybe the Dodgers lost the battle but they could end up winning the war if\nThey have to keep going through their bullpen the way that they did earlier today or I should say on friday night or it could have a bode well for the Dodgers moving forward the deeper and deeper we get into the series and you start wearing down these guys when they rely on so much like Josh later I'm Sorry that's a quick turnaround today for like a\nFour o'clock out first pitch their Milwaukee no doubt yeah\nYeah yeah yeah big

something something to that degree okay so\nWhat are they did really well it's different teams right now because you know what happened in brewers are hot twelfth street ... yeah\nThey have the child of with the home run less fun ah and the brewers when twelve straight so we'll get into baseball too will get into well Verna lander versus sales throws Boston today also opens up was Vicki take it away my brother was driving they\nThat's what we're talking about that game one on friday night of the you know see as we talked about the high drama at the very end of the top of the ninth two outs time run on third base and we'll go to the brewers radio network for this one [noise]\nAnd six if I was the final scores walked reliever Brandon would drip as we talked about a second ago struck out

was a miss with your face on friday\nAs far as close as you think it was a\nDoor executions and\nStuff was good but he just made mistakes and the strike zone and a defensive Lee again we didn't do any

of what lies ahead today it's a big Fox football's latter day seven days a week a college football ... energy not bald eaten up\nOr what are the most interesting ... games of the day is el issue in Georgia there's a lot of talk about George ... around and about what's gonna happen\nCome ... come to play out because if they play Alabama tough or does a one last Georgia team and make it you still have the Irish Notre Dame is upbeat and then I Can't see uh the committee overlooking in beating Notre Dame team for sure\nWhat was really the first week that the um the rankings come out but you know these things have a way of just\nYou got to play to the end I mean these things generally\nThey don't make too many mistakes 'cause there's not that many mistakes to make by the time it gets whittled down and you get through the championship games that first week in December you usually are left standing with your four so I mean I Know the conversation is fun and what ifs and all those things can get talked about\nBut this this is gonna widows self doubt he'll Michigan Ohio State Michigan Wisconsin today I mean these games have a kind of way of separating\nThe teams yeah they do but it's interesting because ah the game is in Baton Rouge I'm with ya it should have been in that I don't know how under the under the like\nYou I don't know why this is not a night game I mean I don't know what's what's gonna happen there because it is a different atmosphere in Baton Rouge at night versus the day um it it's going to be a much much tougher game in the evening but it's you know just to thirty kick there in Baton Rouge today\nSo a look for all your college football fans you don't want to go anywhere now to be one game that if you are in your man cave and you got your four TV's going today that one you're not going to change the channel\nYeah I I I I think I Would shoot keeps his cool that they have a real shot to win this game at home I Know a last week was tough I I actually think that that was you can pull off the upset\nWell it's ... it's about seven and a half point line I think right now a ... shoes off as going to have to produce and we've all seen like that is a problem and that's an issue\nSo I got to see how their office is going to drive the ball against this you know Georgia defense with any consistency with who you know you're gonna have to put up Twenty one points so I go see if they can put up\nOn you know well I Want to see Barrow and and now he's been at times he's looked really good at a time she she struggled to uh you know it's interesting because you know he is thrown for nine touchdown and a twelve hundred yards hundred and fifty yards are more ... more than from from stroke for\nTwelve hundred yards so the numbers are pretty calm mhm um I you know again George George has got a really good defense can run the ball very balanced attack uh I've just looking for I just think it's great football\nYeah she'll be great I mean I I don't know I I don't know if that LSU can can win it I Know it would be a lot different now but in the daytime I think Georgia you know they they look like this is a game that can can you put them up in those yeah in the standings with a solid win and Alice you they know what's at stake here\nYeah uh Oregon and Washington is another of three thirty eastern twelve thirty Pacific game where where did the credible did three thirty twelve thirty games are awesome today\nI mean really Georgia oh issue Washington Oregon you got Penn State Michigan State which I think the game you got to Texas and Baylor and I'm going to tell you I I you may agree with me but I think Baylor is live today\nWell if you look if there is a chance that you can\nBeat taxes today's the day yeah because they're\nComing off this incredible when All right over OU in the red river shoot out an incredible when I mean the best way to Tom Herman's tenure in two years right now and so they're all a huge right now they're all believe in the quarterback and the coach if\nThere was a time for malleable and the Baylor Bears to jump on today's the day\nYup yup I'm ... I'm smelling it I'm smelling with it I say they got a real shot at Texas\nA embarrassed Baylor last year they ran up the score Baylor's all beat up playing a bunch of freshman Matt rules has not forgotten what happened a year ago\nI mean I just think and I know ... office right now is those for receivers they have are tracked me and that quarterback is really good if he has a great day today\nJust the way we saw Oklahoma just run up and down the field of Texas in the fourth quarter I did look they don't have a quarterback like that but it Charlie brewer can extend plays is a good player\nAnd literally was as fast as you needed to be in order to run away from any defense and he can't get on the ... could get on the field I'm\nJust ... they've scored forty five points or more in six straight games has never happened in Alabama as good as they have been that's never happened the the defense has suffered a little bit though not as a top five defense right only because they're on the field more and there\nWere because they could they score it so quickly last week they scored other first play yeah and their third\nPlay ball but you know I mean they'd never throwing the ball like this before and so you're you're telling me no matter what they are defensively anymore because they're jumping on these legion teams are literally having to throw the ball against them or you know in order to like at least make the games somewhat close so\nIf we're looking at history right here in to your question is it all just an exercise with getting to the championship game and how close can another team Ohio State Clemson whoever it is how close can they keep it right now because that's what it looks like\n[noise] yeah I mean he's and to a ... he doesn't throw it completion\nNo he throws bombs [noise] like we've we've ... is the fact is the south pole just makes it look God you know like why given\nYour Steve Young boomers size and throw it might pick how many left he had a quarterback indoor gyms or me go through the list of them I mean there was a handful of guys that you can remember that we're living in L. A. yeah that were really good players but this guy looks like he's better than all of them right now no he\n... he throws pillows to\nReduce who's who's or they drop in his his throes reminds me they remind me of golf rose ... the the the ... the soft is the one thing that golf roses he's a pillow thrower man you already they drop in from the sky\nAnd there was a skill to it and and he ... he's the same way\nI think it's more accurate I mean I don't see missing now I don't see them go into any stretches where balls your aren't ... aren't in the vicinity and you know miss miss reads I mean I just don't see mistakes\nOver his his completion percentage is Seventy five points\nTo a complete so what's his yards per attempt to do you have that no\nI ... I just have is I just had his basic ... well I mean that's five percent at a point do you throw for Fifteen hundred yards and get you know it's funny he winds up sitting and I know for half a ridiculous\nSo ... that that's all going on right now and we we've never seen we've always said what if Alabama ever had a real quarter yeah yeah we've\nAlways said that what they've got real quarterback what would it look like well this is what it looks like\nYou're you're got NFL talent and all these different positions they've got three first round picks on defense that are sitting there might be more right now the officers lines got two guys are going to go high you know these receivers are ridiculous but you know if you if you had\nAn NFL quarterback running to the ... what would it look like well this is what happens\nIt's third ... listen to this this is incredible stat Alabama average is better than a points scored for every snap that to what has taken\nA while I don't know I don't know I'm trying to think what that means I'm so forty five snaps forty five points\nYes he did more than a boy first up more than a point so I mean one point for ... whatever it is yeah well I mean the funny thing is is that that stat\nAll of a sudden becomes really like it becomes a very relevant stat because he's not finishing these games\n... I've ever heard of that southwest traits that never heard that before I Know it it's while it's absolutely why all the uh\nAnd then you wonder like just you know what is what is that who\nWho are way be beat but what was going to happen though is 'cause I maybe to his face another year I mean I don't know maybe stays but if he does every single wide receiver and a country is now going to ... I mean they've already got his broadly players problem is common yeah and his brother supposed to be better ... will come back\nAnd lots to do the start of the NBA season as well they\nGot a garbage\nIf you suffer from eating and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came off patent December eleventh and that the active ingredient that's in the little blue pill is now available on generic form available\nTo you get thirty dollars for a month supply that's a big discount no more getting ripped off by the big pharma companies\nWith four ... dot com you can bypass the doctor's office pharmacy visit and see huge money on your prescription ... just go to for hymns dot com slash better consulted license physician ad following their confidential medical review you\nCan have the proper prescription deliver directly to your door for a fraction of the price and today will supplies last you can get started with a trial month for just five bucks that's right five dollars here's what you do just go to for him dot com F.
