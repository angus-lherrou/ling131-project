{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "Uh trying to get their hands were from DNA some you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure\nWe're defining the natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature member the commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to have a mother nature\nThat one yet none nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a\nPrice and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of\nEvolution right where we do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the de ... thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy your peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to Hoover and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but [noise]\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because\nWe want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around\nGo yeah yeah I ... you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's pretty that writing is on the wall e and\nI mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans\nThere they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about or we once\nPosts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small but\nYou know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity\nThat's what the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is let's use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five but at the smarter machines get\nAnd the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly the magic\nOh absolutely I liked that the cushy Murphy app yesterday um you're right because you know the old saying if you don't use it that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how ... with that the right now I fully believe that completely and ... and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like [noise] like marriages like democracy like

dictators as well as\nMuch of this also is being done and delusion with the corrupt liberal news media hoping to create televised images of little children crying and being separated from their parents right on time for the midterm us elections\nAnd such televised damages the Democrats feel will push suburban Republicans to vote\nDemocrat the plan is simple\nUsually caravan of illegal migrants to tug at the heart strings of American viewers more especially those so called suburban white women the ones Democrats feel well then cause them to vote for the Democrats because President Trump separating families\nOkay so let's get this straight the political party specifically the Democrat Party\nWhich long ago was abandoned the notion of supporting the traditional middle class

the guys are probably goes without saying their anger will very likely escalate if they lose a the midterms and the Republicans retain control of both the house and Senate\nSo you know unless they just accept the situation which is very unlikely and then forced them maybe in what about what they'll do if they lose and they don't ... at the turn their hopes back toward the Mueller probe but one of the smaller which on sales or materialize and it falls apart too\nI have no answer for that but suffice it to say we will likely continue to hear crying and gnashing of teeth\nI think the correct phrase is wailing wailing wailing and say okay baby\nI put it in vernacular there just for a for the sake of our listeners you know last week job there was word porch of a\nComing out of a German
