this fall I see but I I think she's just so happy to be married and have her children that that seriously that's all she really ever wanted how important\nMarion or the dreams for communicating with the debt\nIs very important if somebody died in there was unfinished business\nBecause if when that person comes in your dream you can ask them ... or apologize to them or what did what happened why did we break apart anything like that the same thing somebody that died violently or was murdered\nIf I Can't get to that funeral before that spirit crosses over I Can't give them any law enforcement agencies any information\nBought if that person that was murdered comes in your dream and it was a relative or a friend who asked him what the heck happened and you'd be surprised how ... how much information you can get from them and unfortunately they still don't know the lottery numbers\nNo no no or or if they do they're not passing them on\nExactly rent\nFor a lot of people who were brand new to the show marry him in a while to get to know you a little bit better you've had this gift since you were a little girl\nCorrect old were you\nGrammar realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth tone spirits the problem is most\nBabies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that\nI could talk to the relative that died and Italian\n... everybody's\nRelated somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gifts good\nBut he was he was talking to me and I you know there was no question but would ask the question or the relative\nWould ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the goes target but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was I'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... these\nYoung they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person alive person 'cause I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did or did you always happen like that\n[noise] no I think that the older I got\nThe easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is\nAnd then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time and ... so it it improves\nEvery time I I really believe that it does it takes me but three seconds now to open a white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like\nA hospital or an airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds in there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning\nThing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing\nOh maybe twenty five thirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front\nOf my face and and I wouldn't go to houses if I thought it goes to kill me I Am certainly not stupid\nBut I remember I was in the garage\nAnd that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when it hit\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach courage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here\nAnd then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've\nGot a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it still free will but you're gonna leave this health one way or

freaky\nMay I say if you if you buy me a favor right like if any body solve this cause like if anybody knows this dude and has an idea\nYeah look I'm pretty good so far I got off to a bit of a bad start this season finished on a bit of a hot streak Clinton curse Shaw not playoff Kurdish will actually put pitching well from once in a post season so if we can keep it up in the um from ones that are doing anyway so he was ... the U.S electric about\n... it was interesting was ... it wasn't like he was struck him everybody out he used his pitches really economically he was he didn't miss but he was one of those grooves where everything was over the place like he threw strikes strikes and strikes\nAnd he's really out to change the way he's pitched this year he's really lost a lot of electricity even that last strike out that he got to end the eighth inning was eighty seven miles an hour\nI mean for a guy that was consistently hit Ninety three Ninety four or in his prime so he's really be a different kind of pitcher at this point in his career and he realizes that into your point you only have three strike as a game but doesn't mean he was any less dominant against that line of so pretty impressive and their best pitcher as even pitched yet\nThat's there are a young kid Walker viewer who's going to do on Sunday on ... you had to try to try to ah finished the sweep so we'll see what happens there will break your age\nYour [laughter] the uh the Braves you chose yeah\nI think the Indians come back on the on the strokes\nThan Houston is tough man Houston is really tough I mean it's a lot of pitching staff with VR lander the addict Garrett coal has all season and he came in and he's been dominant for them to to go along with I Will be great so I mean\nI had to

for Milwaukee in LA\nSo we'll see what happens she ... the the ... one last crime yeah are you with me here fig these series she'll be seven games\n[noise] yeah I think it takes a little bit of the the upset factor out of it but most of the I think the majority of the time the better team ends up winning and about four games any way the majority of the time\nEvery now and then you but the the you have a greater chance of an upset and it was like this is the NBA back to when you at the first round being alive games but those were very rare occurrence is all it did was give underdog teams a little bit better of an opportunity to stage an upset but generally speaking\nI don't think anybody would complain about getting more quality baseball if you can so I wouldn't be I wouldn't be opposed to it\nDrives me insane I don't understand this board ... it's the best sport\nYeah happens in October\nWhy wouldn't you want Egypt chapter in October like the NBA\nRight and we know how much the same
