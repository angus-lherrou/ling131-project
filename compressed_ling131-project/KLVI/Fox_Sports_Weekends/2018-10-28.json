I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're originally let out of jail and then he is kind of you if you can test and said yeah it was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nIs that right ... ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs only things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of a literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the the\nHalloween a ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see a kind of bumps like that or is it just it's like it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some business is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more of a ... year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and throw happens their biggest one is October which\nWill never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the tapes is open so I I I Would never have gas shops that are just hoping for one month in in Salem\nYeah but and but other but they're realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nThat now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum until they're starting to realize that they can do this year round us down grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem\nWhat are the rules a lake or curbs that they then are either written or unwritten about how people are too you know ... or to or how they want tourists to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it's actually a ... year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance they are the burial ground which is the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nThat do that there's there's on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a part of you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people have the nights over ... start heading the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally lately and ten pm\nYeah I Believe it's a ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing that's a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight money around an aloe lean on\nAs ironic did they make everybody get off the streets Salem before the ...\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad [laughter] really bad\nWhen they got to get them out before the ... or maybe the

I hardly [noise]\n[noise]\nNo no that's okay you'll find out if there's a lot of mistakes and that's where human that's what it's all about where human when I went out machines but you know what the big surprise I guess in college football has to be Washington state Mike Leach\nWhy his state of the Stanford yesterday forty one thirty eight and Washington state right now if you look at the ... the only team in the past twelve with fewer than two conference losses but to me I mean really when you say he might very well be coach of the year this year well\nHe's got to be in the running and I'll tell you this Andy ferman as I look at the ... of college football in my opinion in terms of my perspective would be UCF okay you know how I Love to beat up on UCF and they're horrible schedule it's terrible and\nThe bleeding hearts they use the upsides and why do they get it because they don't play any body good that's why I look at this Washington state team Washington state has to\nBe ranked ahead of UCF you look at Washington state they've beaten Stanford they beat Oregon they beat in Utah those are three legitimate impressive wins who has UCF beating that impresses you who\nYou know what I have gone around and around and around with you and certainly UCF does not impressed me at all and uh go one step further South Florida the neighbor got wrapped yesterday by used in fifty seven thirty six for a loss but you know what I\nJust think that that gray area with these rankings has always been that quote I test\nAnd maybe it's I look I'm with you it's like who you play and who you beat and like ... and it's it's also the coverage that you were in and accomplish that they're in the AC is believing not even the same breath as a farewell to live or you know the people that do the voting I guess just look at\nThe style of play and how they play and they say well it's just not their fault that they're not in that conference I I don't know how they entered that I really don't know if this\nOh it's not their fault they play in a stocky God awful conference okay great yeah we'll schedule up\nNon conference wise and they don't they've scheduled F. C. S. opponent South Carolina state\nThey beat Florida Atlantic they rolled pit which is that to the instant win but it's nothing special about the right about\nThat era Don conference schedule I Can't be that bad when you play in that bad of a conference so I look at teams that are in the eight people ranked under them I Would have four teams when the playoff committee unveiled the first poll of the season on Tuesday\nI Would have Ohio State Kentucky whose beat in Florida on the road\nI Would have West Virginia I Would also have Washington state all rang I had to use the F all of them I Would ...\nEven though Texas and Florida lost and they will be below UCF I Would have four teams that are currently under UCF ahead of them when the playoffs committee ... releases the first poll\nYeah and what a win for Kentucky yesterday beat Missouri on the road Fifteen fourteen and come back when I mean right now Kentucky\nControl their destiny and the SEC east they've got a big game that's where they played Georgia next week I mean there's a chance right now Kentucky could roll I mean I I don't see them beating Georgia especially I I just I just don't think they have the manpower especially with Georgia did the Florida yesterday but I I'm I'm very impressed with what the heck Kentucky has done thus far this year\nYeah that's the biggest football game in Kentucky history next week hosting Georgia but yeah they've had a good season seven in one so far and a tougher road a much tougher road than what we've seen from UCF I Know people think it's personal it's not personal\nIt's just I hate bad logic I hate how it turns into this\nWorld Cup on let's grade on a curve in the bleeding hearts it's like a Sally Struthers tell us on you know where Sally Struthers dislike for Fifteen cents a day you can help these poor unfortunate kids that's how people act\nWhen it comes to use the F since joke\nIs ridiculous looking Alabama people crack on their schedule they are at number\nNow for LSU next week do you realize what people would be saying if UCF was at LSU and played that game they wouldn't stop talking about that game but it's a cost over when it's Alabama it's just ridiculous you know one yeah\nI I've always believed that people should always stay in their lane and that means teams as well and I think that college football as well served back in the day when they had that one double A.\nAnd keep it that way you know there are certain teams that don't belong in the big leagues\nAnd the conference of ACT American athletic conference would UCF in South Florida in Houston and Cincinnati Tulane east Carolina they do not belong in the same breath as the SEC or the big twelve of the pack twelve there just off but I may have let them in there\nIf there are four seats at the playoff table you got to have a legitimate resume you got to have a tough road you got to have at least an impressive when you got to go outside of the conference in schedule a big boy Boise they did it for years and years and years I so this idea of all no one wants to lose to use the F 'cause it's gonna be in ...\n... will Boise State found a way year after year after year to schedule an impressive opponent in the non conference schedule and they told Oklahoma wielding UCF can do it they just haven't and I'm not going to grade on a curve because they haven't\nSo of course they don't have that hanging down to do it that is [laughter] I'd rather be able in their own little way and say they want and then they'll stop crime that they deserve more but you don't want to prove it that's what you've got to do that to be an advocate\nAndy I'd be the biggest advocate\nIf they had a couple of big time wins if they scheduled up in the ... conference\nI Would be saying that it'd be like hey look this schedule in the conference is what it is but they went out and they beat insert this team at they went out and beat this ranked team that's impressive they deserve it they ran the table again I Would be campaigning for them but they don't have that non conference when that's impressive they don't like\nAnd somehow they're stopped by club security physical altercation of some sort of this has just hours before the game against Philadelphia I Know\nIt's amazing isn't it the hype of letters for net being out Blake borders has been hideous they've been one dimensional not being able to run the football consistently they are all these injuries on the defensive side of the football he cut half of their secondary getting detained by clubs security is a mess over here\nAnd they do have a lot of those side they traded for Carlos when exactly [laughter] you know this Carlos ... all that other stuff out no\nNo no he is the first of all I Would think that the night before I gained is somewhat of a curfew maybe I'm mistaken but I think that most of these clubs have curfews so why they were out is beyond me okay let's just give them the benefit of the doubt that the coach treats them as professionals or say get the better the normal hours so they went out okay\nWhy were you not want to pay the bill\nAnd I don't understand how you could run up a bill sixty four thousand dollars anyway what do you what are you spending it on ... that's\nThe thing that's maybe why the altercation happened maybe they're disputing what they actually\nBought you know\nWhere all of a sudden it happens where you have this club building it's outrageous and what are you going to do you just going to say no that's not mine and they don't believe you and it turns into this whole thing but never should have ...\nThe lead up to a physical altercation right we've got to get the details but your initial point why are you out at that time this close to a game time you know\nIs that right but in any event\nThis does not look good for the Jacksonville Jaguars they've been out scored Ninety to twenty eight over the last three games\nAnd they're not trending up I'll say that and they're playing a desperate Philadelphia Eagles team that three in for the same record as the jags and they're going to be that much tougher to beat today because Jacksonville has made this came tougher on themselves\nOr I'll give you actually have a lot of credit they did not released and they have no one knows who these players wore which to me I give him a lot of credit or maybe if the game was stateside we know the names and maybe it was in England I don't know yeah I didn't name it had been released I don't know if these are the exact\nNames but the names that were released those cornerback DJ Hayden safety Ronnie Harris and safety dried Wilson safety Barry Church uh so that's what you have reportedly yeah those players were arrested for players you know for players were arrested\nAmazing it really is just to stop it really doesn't Brian oh Andy ferment will live from the guy called Fox Sports radio studios and now they have the toughest be in the league that snatch the first two are guy he's retiring\nAre of it but the latest well thank you very much guys than it was quite an eventful ninth inning at Dodger Stadium Saturday Night Sanders plans in Iraq\nRegard for the red Sox radio network is they beat the Dodgers nine six Boston leads the series three games to one and can wrap it up with a when Sunday night in the Los Angeles on the college gridiron Oklahoma State with the upset of number six Texas thirty eight\nThirty five wall Mississippi State is still partying I'm sure in stark Vegas baby number sixteen ... saying them twenty eight to Thirteen Arizona hammered number Nineteen Oregon forty four Fifteen walk Houston crushed number Twenty one in South Florida\nFifty seven thirty six number four teams Washington state a forty one thirty eight when a number twenty four Sanford and number seven Georgia took care of number nine Florida [noise] thirty six\nSeventeen online car shopping can be confusing not anymore with Trump rise from true car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next car so it was a true card to enjoy a more confident car buying experience and yes we are just three hours away from kick off in London between the eagles and the jaguars\nAnd to clear some things I was eight fifty thousand pound bill you guys have mentioned was translates to about sixty four thousand dollars the foreign players\nOnly three of them were ... were arrested very church was not arrested\nBudge nobody was charged with anything or this coming out today is the story goes\nNuts ... was actually charged the matter is considered to be resolved the bills paid and also this happened friday night early Saturday morning not this morning so it wasn't the day before or was it the day of the game it was actually the day before [noise] so we knew we could count on you Ralph\n... game time close game time\nRalph Irving is what happens when you send a team to London six years and this is why the NFL in London would probably not work out\nToo well wait a minute wait a minute ... guys do something possibly silly and get arrested in white won't work out\nBecause the London trip is a fully\nRight they want to split it's nice not a business trip is a vacation for these guys they want to explore the new turf that's what it is it really is you would do the same thing\nRight right I Am I correct who me Iraq yeah most high real rally it's suddenly it wherever they live for its\nBetween going out let's do some sightseeing let's go out and have a good time but that's different than we're going to get into a physical altercation with clubs security says we owe this about a ... like that's a whole different ball ball game right there\nAnd what does your wife sightseeing the last two years this third year you're going to get a new one author Cajun at the bar\nYeah and and you know what you're making it sound like they went to get it to ... to ... we don't know the entire story maybe the guy tried as he saw these guys these sort of football players it's still a big time money from the U.S they said I'm going to build these guys big time\nYou know another story I'm not I'm taking their side now maybe they were screwed maybe they built was inflated we do know\n\nThey officially it has been it has been resolved with the with the legal issues that's below the official statement though\nI'm Glad to hear that thank you so much really I Want to welcome everybody to the ... duty as opposed to bike I go it's easier to say fifty percent of moral car insurance was guy called the other guy\nDot com will call eight hundred nine four seven or do they only hard part figuring out which way is usually a Bronx talk radio in less than\nTen minutes and the ravens at Panthers and I'm going to try once again with my line of work ravens at what ... what do you mean\nWhat what we're able to an ear\nRavens at Panthers okay a check it out here Baltimore given up three Bolton was given three\nYes I ... it was in ... if it's like a point off or whatever I've got it at two and a half Caroline is two and a half point home dog\nIf you're in the point five territory that's fine because it depends on whatever you're looking at on line ... with one and a half now you're crazy person you know\nRight I Know I'm with you OK yeah not not the ravens right now last week the ravens also heartbreaking to New Orleans by a point twenty four twenty three Panthers feet the eagles Twenty one Seventeen\nAnd that's about the ravens defense right now what are the best in the lead with their linebacker Israel ... can a young scenarios Smith and I'll tell you what Kim new may have his work cut out for him today I don't see him running a lot today because I don't think he can address these guys\nWell you look at the ravens is you're pointing out Andy number one in scoring defense number one in total defense they've only given up about two hundred and eighty yards per game\nTo eighty point six if you want to be precise that's really good they leave the league in Saks with twenty seven so it's a tough defense man and like you're talking about with Cam Newton might not be running a whole lot today but he's been successful this season you look at him right now in past rating he's fourteenth\nRight under Ninety five which is good leads all quarterbacks with two hundred and fifty seven rushing yards so it's been an under the radar sneaky good season for Cam Newton not a whole lot of fanfare but was huge on that game winning drive last week at Philly the fourth and ten was a clutch throw so camp\nWe'll see what he can do today at home against the ravens team\nToo tough game is back to back because even though Phillies record is bad meeting them on the road when they were desperate last week at three and three before the\nPanthers gave him an el that's a nice way and but to come back home with a raven theme as you said heartbreaking loss with Justin Tucker missing the extra point this is not an easy game they'll ... let's see what they're made of\nDid you see the replay on TV with Justin Tucker's eyes [laughter] yeah they were going to come out of his head yeah and I don't blame them really\nThat was the first extra point you've never met like I I'm just in soccer I don't miss extra points what's happening over here that's how we look at it yeah\nYou just don't how many bedrooms went crazy after that last\nOh my gosh can you imagine losing on that ah you remember any if you go back into the hot tub time machine remember when they made this new extra point rule\nAnd they were a lot of people that were like how much difference does it really going to make I mean really come on it's made a big difference last week would be a huge indication of how big of a difference it made\nYou know I I tell you what I'm not really a big advocate of change\nBecause you know why I'm a stat guy and like when you look at the record books it doesn't really mean anything because now you extra points at the thirty three yard line as opposed to what it used to be like was seven to ten yards out which is ridiculous so you can't do any comparisons right there but yes it does change the game the Pittsburgh Steelers and their situation\nThey go for two and a lot more than they go for one that's what they do right now because now ... now what though I mean if if you talk to my Tom and I mean he will tell you that if it wasn't that he'll go for the two I think that they do it it was a little more so more so than any other team in the league\nA nationwide stadium tour with Bill and Hillary [laughter] they've got the ... eruption section where those bands get comp\nAnd Obama folks Obama I'm Tate he can't draw crowds is out there trying to claim credit for this economy wouldn't you wouldn't know how to create in fact the Democrats are the people that have people on their side that love bombs\nBill errors\nOne of Obama's buddies and in fact but I'm not saying there is any connection do not misunderstand me\nBut the other Sondra bocce is\nRight on the money here Here's Mark in Orlando or as I guess in Orlando um [noise] in Florida right the happy to hear or whether it's mark Hi\nMega did U.S Russia a truly an honor to speak with you so well I was holding for you a couple of things popped in my head and I'll get to the point two seconds\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folks started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... tell me 'cause I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the hills of these um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know the success Republicans\nRight and we'll watch or we're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nYeah it was a point it was a plant in it and it was all the it was all nonsense to garner apathy and\n... it was already plan to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing\nThat right correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan and it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences\nAnd there are no ah you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up and so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for her while she's being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like can conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have never let a good conspiracy theory go to ... never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence as with them as soon as I say this is a philosophy that I have a stall for four years on this program is asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth um it's [noise]\nIt is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately\nNeed to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory you try to show everybody he can still move the needle it working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts\nI used to the rush to excellent store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton I'm a week before\nAnd that it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but\nI I have\nFor everything you've done in my family me I Can't help it I find you the most compelling most interesting guy\nThat I have run across I wanted to meet you for I don't know how long

world betting on the Green Bay Packers and it's not going well for Vegas because the Packers are winning right now and to nothing never and his career was Aaron Rodgers a bigger underdog but he was going into this game what are we watching here right now from\nWatching uh LA teams come out little stagnant\nOr maybe they'd been reading the press clippings are on the flip side of that was the Green Bay team really get an average year ago making them uncomfortable they're not going to let them sit back there and and pick them apart with all the weapons they have outside they're going to come after them\nAnd we've seen a Aaron Rodgers find finally you know utilize Jimmy Graham early in his game which I think there's a difference maker in the middle of the feel\nUm if the rams do have a weak spot it would be that area so I mean they come out with the ... plan or in terms of Green Bay and we see the rams kind of sitting on their laurels a little bit than uh you know\nWell I I tell you what the big play that set up the Packers first touchdown a passive device to Adams forty heart beautifully was I mean mark is Peters is all over him\nAgain there are passes where you're saying there is no way that can be that\nAccurate from that distance it literally went right to mark his Peter's right into the hands of divide it in the book non verbal labels will pass by Aaron Rodgers so we got a ten nothing Packer labored watching right now now another game that flip that's on right now\nThe raiders at home against the Colts this game open as up pick 'em by kicked off any was anywhere from a three and a half to four point favorite but right now the raiders who have to ... tackles no Marcia and let you know I'm Ari Cooper are leading the colds fourteen to ten\nMaybe it to your quarterback crying last week for for you can do their own or allegedly crying last week for you guys get on the same page I\nLove their early energy let's see if they can sustain this you know the the raiders this season have are very collapsible\nSo we'll we'll see if they can sustain this four point lead and continue to put pressure on Oakland Raiders I mean on the uh\nUh no uh Indiana Indianapolis\nGo get Indianapolis goal in the Annapolis or the raiders made apparently a message today that Derrick car is safe now we know that doesn't mean anything right off or get on the table we've also heard\nThat it Derrick car is not traded that he's going to be flat out released before next season to save a bunch of cabs space this is an absolute do over\nFor John grew into right now and this was a shock to Derrick car who thought we were just real loading not rebuilding after a downy are just two years removed from a twelve and four seasons so what do you make so four of the uh grew to experiment with the silver and black\nOr the thing is when you sign a coach to that type of job security with a hundred and and you're a hundred million dollar guarantee a deal\nThen this is what you get he gets to make decisions from the ... with\nAbsolutely no records he doesn't he's not on the hot seat he can lose every game from now for the next three years and still wouldn't be fired he still wouldn't be on the hockey fights\nSo you might as well take advantage of that nature Julie\nWhile he was going to do what he wants to do if he doesn't like the makeup of the team now we all thought that their car was this guy he raved about him when he had him when he was a brutal grinder and he had them into the quarterback bus or whatever that is and now all of a sudden\nA report coming out that he may be shopped or he's not happy with them so you know looking at the quarterback landscape out there who would they if they traded him I mean who's going to be well\nHere's the thing about the raiders and and ... grew it in particular he's not a guy who knows how to groom a young quarterback rally talked a lot of young quarterbacks or a member of the criticisms ... down in Tampa Bay and they went fishing resigned Jeff Garcia\nTo save the day so um my guess is I mean they got five number one pick so over the next two years already what is he going to do with those picture and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios will get to that plus\nAlready some interesting games in the books in the NFL ... kept coming up next\nWe'll\n[noise] they're making them play\nWe're

Gore territory because no one else is doing you know has done that and now remember Adrian has to get to a thousand yards or for him to get on that list with a guy\nBut he's well on his way this season and when he plays like this and when they're able to create space for them that he created his own space as you as well though\nWashington becomes a better football team and when I mean we we graphically showed it today in the law says you remembered that New Orleans ... when he got hurt and then the other last July Indianapolis get like twenty yards or something like that so and the other games he's averaging well over a hundred yards per game now\nThat tells you how Washington plays which may be a little bit different than you would expect from a J courting team\nBut he's riding a wave right now and Adrian Peterson leading it\nI I and I and I think that's the formula for my you know Alex Smith is a a leader that team and we were talking about him he's not going to burn up to ... he's going to be extremely accurate with the ball he's not going to turn it all turned over but when you give 'em a dynamic running back\nAdrian Peterson it takes a lot of pressure of him trying to stretch the field all the time and we see you know him twenty four or thirty two hundred and Seventy yard touchdown ... interceptions\nThat's what you look at that's what you like from him being able to hit the ball off thirty three times to a bevy of running backs mostly Adrian Peterson\n... that's going to be our recipe for success because when\nAdrian has Nineteen and more carries he gets up close to the ... century mark\nYeah and and the one thing that I'm looking at in [noise] the words the stain of all is just to stay in a book or Washington now this formula worked well for a number of other teams the\nOne thing I I'm going to keep an eye on and I see them again next week against that lab\nAnd they end up in a game where let's say Atlanta's cranky and they've been playing much better off than you guys know recently\nWhat if it turned into a little bit more of a we have to keep up [noise] that's where I Want to see what Washington going to do because what Alex had last year in Kansas City remember how creme ... get rushing also can catch it out of the backfield but he also through adoptive Atari kill and and and ...\nSo when you're talking about two guys who can trade you down field who is doing that for Washington Jordan read is a terrific receivers that tell you that I have not seen the bigger place from him this year and and who is doing it outside they haven't had that guy so far that's going to be the interesting thing with their formula what happens if someone stretches them\nAnd make them have to do a little bit of chasing and in a dynamic fashion Atlanta could be that team to test them that way next week it that'll be fun to see how they play\nCharles Davis is joining us on the flip side the giants are now one in seven manning was seven times he wrote a couple of ... ah they threw the ball Barclay only thirty ... yards on the ground and he had Seventy three yards receiving your evaluation Charles where are we with the giants now\n[noise] well that off into line unfortunately is is not getting better you know they kept hoping to get some type of\nHay in the middle of the season these guys have come together and get better I don't know that that's going to happen\nIt's a makeshift line to begin with I'm older who they put all the money into is not in the rock that they've ... they they expected or now this is going to be good at guard but he's a rocky and he like got sacked seven times and I watched it it felt like more guys\nSoon they have ... pressure\nHe was knocked out of ... there was a lot of times when you get rid of it but you got to understand so that's a problem for them you mentioned say quants rushing totals they can't run the ball they can't move people and the Washington ... ... those young those young babble voice ...\nThey get a lot of attention in Iran paying job but Allen but the guy who showed up today in addition because those guys were great was it was a I and I met either as bad as simple actually had two and a half stack and without the run game so if you can't run the ball Washington makes it hard for you to run it\nNow you gotta go deal with the deal with the secondary but a lot better or with so I'll meet you to see what's going to have to go with that but with the giants have an open week and then I Believe their game is on the road I don't have the schedule in front of me but believed there on the road\nYeah they are going to be at the yeah\nIf they're going to test the\nYoung quarterback while at a time when I think they have to do that your optimum time but they also could elect to go who would you say the next give me the Seattle\nNo at the forty niners said the\nForty niners to me that's optimal and I'm not saying that the advocate bench Eli Manning the point where it's fine it's just\nThat they're there one in seven they messed up last year because they didn't look at Davis Web that look the Gina Smith would pay zero that's what you had tape on ... Web could do so they blew that PR wise football wise everything this is a new regime\nI think that they will do it much better this time and I think they'll actually have discussions with the lie to discuss what's going to happen how you want to handle it and they have a little bit of time to get that done but I think it has to start happening that discussion has to be in play unfortunately and it might be the best ... right now is getting beat up [noise]\nI'm sure contracts and then the process started what's now called the Tom share cancellation industry time shares the only thing that you
