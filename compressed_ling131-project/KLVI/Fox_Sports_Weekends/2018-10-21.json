addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James hike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret to do this and that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but\nMaybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV [noise]\nYes and and he does a little upfront research\nBrings it into the San says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nBut this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics that just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it that it does or doesn't I I just\nIt it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do the same ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do these than it is and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do step on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote a wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to do this mistake\nHow all those who lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue with\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic media those are the were\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com is the both the paperback and e book and I

sports\nHas Harry Houdini as a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona about\nFashion that's fantastic well we'll have to get to Dr Schwartz on the program again and follow up\nOn that yes thank you so much for this\nWell Richard you're an excellent host you have a good heart and work you do with making the world a better place and I appreciate it\nAll right God

wiser\nTo stay in school go through the motions of school work right for the time being\nInstead of dealing with all of this stuff about leaving early and maybe not being a teen guy maybe being a mean guy and people understand it more so at the end of the season if you aren't in contention for a playoff spot as opposed to right here right now and just saying I'm Out of here I think it's worth going through the motions of school work to avoid that\nThat perception of your just me guy\nRight now I I hear ya makes a lot of sense and that that had to be some\nUnderlying current maybe why he wanted to leave and maybe urban Meyer and he talked we don't know this ... or ... if you're not going to get the hell out who knows you just don't know we'll never find that we really want but you know he he's getting some heat but don't blame the loss on him that's for certain but yesterday when the highest they lost Oklahoma did beat TCU fifty two twenty seven why bring that up\nBecause this this committee there'll be get it to all the time\nAnd they have the the committee what the top four teams obviously they compare comet opponents no Ohio State beat TCU forty twenty eight back in September Oklahoma beat the fifty two for twenty seven yesterday so you don't Ohio State right now you know they have a neutral site when it gets that TCU they've got a road with the Penn State\nAnd they need to beat Michigan State on the tenth on November and obviously it all comes down probably to November twenty fourth with Michigan\nYeah mean Ohio State as ugly as it was last night and that's a that's a bad laws to get rolled the way they did at Purdue but if they run the table like you said and if they take down Michigan State which is very possible Michigan State is not a very good football team\nAnd you win a home game against Michigan who's had all kinds of trouble against Ohio State you go to the Big Ten championship game if you win that Ohio state's got a legitimate resume and also you mentioned Oklahoma\nOklahoma they lose the red river rivalry against taxes but if they run the table and possibly be taxes in the big twelve championship game\nDepending on what happens in front of them they've got a legitimate shot they at least have a pulse for the play off right now it's not a you know like a healthy pulse but it's still there you can still detect the polls from the sooner is right now\nBut I tell you right now if I went to the top four I'd have Oklahoma fifth looking in Alabama clear cutting number one\nWait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute how can you have Oklahoma overall Georgia in Texas the team\nBecause I have with us have Alabama one I have Clemson too I have Notre Dame three uh-huh have Michigan for Michigan for\nThen why you have Michigan leapfrogging LSU\nBecause I just don't trust the LSU as often as I think their office right now and I understand and and obviously I Want to see what they do it down the road they still have a couple of more games to play but I I just think that office right now because\nOf the I test I'm going to be like the committee on that I Try to stay I asked\nWhere was the I test when they're smack it around the number two ranked Georgia Bulldogs at the time by twenty points the other week where was that\nThat's why I have George it down to separate the race I I don't trust Georgia, Georgia was a fraud I don't think they were there oh wow I bet I test is is a great great area for people like me or the committee to use as a crutch you know you have an excuse why are they there I test high test really tire\nYou you gotta go buy a resume screw the I test All right I'm going to print out T shirts that say that screw\nThe I test goal by who they played in who they beat and LSU resume is more impressive than Michigan's\nResume in terms of who they played who they beat right now who's the number two ranked team that Michigan took down on their schedule huh you're waiting around Michigan or SMU it's gotten a brat\nSo LSU there there were no the Miami is not as impressive now as it was then they beat all burn okay they beat Georgia which I don't think there's that impressive either and they found is that\nHow how is that that impressive they took them down and that was a whisker away from winning at all last year there are number two ranked in the nation and they smack 'em around by twenty points and I would like yawn\nWake me up when I knew something significant\nAnd their office space it is the foot of coal Tracy that's basically their office really without a that's\nWhat it is in this day and age 'cause you watch Patrick homes and Tom Brady dual a forty three forty game\nAnd unless they're thrown at all over the place in scoring points gaining yards you're like get outta my face with your great deep ... that can hold an opponent to three points like they'd they'd Mississippi State last night now gave me off it can be bad as the staff give me all that stuff otherwise I'm writing you off this is Andy for him and talking\nAnd that's what the committee is going to say is well you'll see but we have three ... burn okay\nI'll get you hate it I I

be Cleveland last week so charges at one three straight ties laws to straight I think the charges roll them today I really do\nThey charge put up a lot of points today\nOkay so ah Andy ferman were just what a half hour in today like this you're going chargers minus six and a half in London lay the point you say\nNo doubt no doubt about that\nNot not a bad you're proud of me maybe\nA mensch you may have mentioned I mean that's what you did and I appreciate that\nWasn't the only thing I Wonder ... real quickly the only thing I Wonder the chargers you know Andy\nWe saw it a couple of weeks ago they are hosting the forty niners first game without Jimmy gr Rob Lowe in steps in CJ bath third and they barely wins twenty nine to twenty seven so every now and then the chargers just absolutely sleep walk through a game\nSo I think it's more to do with that if they come out and they are focused yeah there are the better team they should beat the titans comfortably but if it's one of these ethics chargers hey we can show up and we'll be fine and they just aren't sloppy it yeah the titans can keep it within six I think so\nNo hope they don't have ... we'll see about that Brian no way for

it's a half point I'm not gonna you know go crazy on yeah Andy I see it's plus you have to again it depends on where you're looking at it exactly but\n... not going to play man what are they going to do hop a private jet and be there for game time they have a rule them out yet but I honestly ... these tree it's he's not in a play now\nAbout who the man is going to play as Tom Brady and why is the

thought it would be but there was a good game today the patch and bears baseless overtime list with to your dolphins I was shocked they're thirty one twenty eight\nAnd then this could be a good one you know without chronicles so this could be a very good game and you know what I'm looking I'm leaning towards\nThe bears how's that wow look at that dogs are barking at Holmes says Andy from and I don't see at the same way [laughter] I'm\nGetting on the opposite side because the patriots they're one of these teams that\nThey don't come out completely flat I realize Sunday Night Football game that was nice when at home against the cheat you know and there's a lot of attention and all that stuff but I just don't see them even without grants just showing up against the bears and completely laying an egg\nI don't see that because they finally got that often going there averaging just under forty points per game over the last three wins they're gaining four hundred and sixty two yards of total off cents each game in that span\nAnd I know how much as you do Andy how much Rob Gronkowski means to that often but I don't think they're going to completely fall off I expect them especially with ... ankle injury he's ...\nI don't think that bears defense is going to just shut down the patriots to the tune where the bears when this game I think the patriots events has a lot to prove\nAfter playing Patrick ... and company last week and I think playing Michel ... in company is going to be a significant notch below what they face last week and that\nDouble crossing\nPorn star

wanted to go in the first quarter Washington up seven nothing over the cowboys would too but it's to play in the first\nIn the corner there was a southern thing late for that you don't like it was you know twenty water quality or nothing at that point the way the eagles were dominating\nCarolina on the first three quarters part though are twice for your call I don't think you'll go rent so in the last bit of seven and all of a sudden it was like a\nYou know a lot of wind up scoring touchdowns in the last forty one [laughter] I just want to come back in franchise history it was an incredible a fine line ones are what are the gamut\nYou're a ... three or four now they have to travel but was it on Thursday to play the jaguars next Sunday\nYeah let's talk about Philadelphia I'm a raining Superbowl champs a lot of high expectations coming in Carson when coming back from injury and there are three and four under five hundred at this point in the season what\nWhat is it did you see that they need to do to be able to finish these games being up Seventeen nothing in the second half\nRunning you know it's funny I mean three quarters they dominated on both sides of the office only watch was having a terrific day now they are let's say a couple of running a giant Doris older course but a ... day\nOld Shawn Jeffrey has some great pledges for the first touchdown some really nice cat just to extend drives and that's the way they were getting the job done this I can do a couple of times in the first out than it was smooth sailing for the eagles really for three quarters and then\nAll of a sudden the Panthers turned out of the more than a couple of long drives and then um there was an interception at one point or read it you know they called it back when the eagles were driving towards the end of the game but the charge a lot of the fence wound up doing a terrific job on the next couple of players and kept the eagles out of the answer to\nMake any you know when I look on the other side with the Panthers in one of the things that I don't know if\nI'm concerned or I don't know if this is just the way they are and that's the way the amount of Russia's even I've talked about this really the last few weeks and we said that Tim dude and shouldn't lead your team in Russia is not as if this is ... where the quarterback interest Fifteen twenty times he leaves I'm at today again was seven\nAt seven as well tense I mean is this recipe to win for them or can they find them to get some more rushing attempts more Russian Guards from someone else\nDo I read your run it and I know are we supposed to interrupt started yesterday it like to have a nice balance um that are that that's the case you know last week the cap rate went through um\nFour times I think on the first Rodriguez watch that have been able to carry the ball or it's on the rest of the game not to use them in a lot of different ways leading receiver got the path out of the deal are they doing like also backed down three games this was just that that can distort the gambling touchdowns that certainly\nUm you know at at other terrific player for the afternoon game but it wasn't like that or a bigger balance did have some nice runs today at one point it actually had more\nCautious than than passing yards was thirty eight rushing the odds are near the one point\nIt only twenty yards through the air but um it was a profit on the fourth quarter you know up until that not much but I think the biggest playing the game was a fan\nWith the Panthers trailing by a pattern within about three and a half but it's a pleasure to strip the former eagle that cup third short drive a lot for\nOur ... going forward um\nWhat is it that you think the Carolina needs to do to ride the wave of success and continue not plane from behind like they did today but not only do defensively but often simply you know hitting on to the fact that they don't have\nA lead rush or do they need more balance or is it going to be moving forward the same thing you do you know passing earlier a running early been passing late to me it seems like a great balance moving forward is the way for them to continue to have success\nRight and and this is actually the second straight week the odds that it did nothing that's real Washington shut up in the last week but that was for a couple of turnovers ... more turn that over twice last week a return over as the first out\nNow in today's case it was just not there yet but it was that drives up during the first five thought but they probably wouldn't like or that or you know balance with running can\nShatter severely planted a you know here's the backup running back to the cap rid of all of that yeah the ... all can't walk he was on one of their ... but the ball didn't go his way they\nAsk us ever so they're starting to develop Kurdish Daniels the second you're out of Ohio State\nYeah Russian touchdown today a DJ more going out to their first rough it got to

he ain't do people want to replace you with him right who is it different when you know it's it was the first round draft pick and they come in in your the ... we're\nNot worried about the Arab parents who Drew Brees no not yet but coming off Joe flag goes\nTo previous seasons we were looking to replace him the organization was looking to find the next guy and I think that has a lot to do with it ties into probably his frustrations when they introduced\nThe packages ... yeah I could imagine that for the guy who everybody's screaming you coming in and you write all the accolades 'cause he's only running into the ... yeah it was not like he's doing passes for interceptions so we'll\nContinue the conversation and ah some give you some highlights and updates on what's happening right now but right now it's trending ...

Van Dyk here to ban that sound that binocular is that that LeBron ... men who I knew it\nSubstitute kicker is from Kevin Love last year you know or JR Smith last year and know what I mean Panthers trail that Philadelphia Seventeen to nothing with ten forty two left in the fourth rally for three touchdowns in an incredible Twenty one Seventeen went on the road\nAgainst the Superbowl champs Vikings over the jets thirty seven Seventeen\nLions one in Miami thirty two to Twenty one Texans what uh Jacksonville twenty to seven and a game that saw the jaguars bench Blake boardrooms colds over the bills thirty seven to five earlier in London the chargers defeated the titans twenty to Nineteen this report presented by true car\nOnline car shopping can be confusing not anymore with troop ... car now you can do the exact price you pay for your next course of his true to enjoy more confident car buying experience one final note from baseball the angels named Brad off missed their new managers succeeding Mike ... back to the firm in trivia king Kelvin why\nAre they big ... right now we're joined by a touchdown for the cowboys are ... what a forty nine yard touchdown pass we'll get some more information on that and just a moment we're joined now we were just talking about that overtime game rounds in bucks we're joined by Sam Rosen who was on the call Sam how are you\nA great guys how's it going\nGood what we would all good and I don't know if you are we talking about what Ron upset about that tweet ban it's been a crazy season for the bronze first of all have you ever in the history of your life I don't even care but it's it's pop Warner to high school or college the pros seen one team go to overtime so many times for\nFour times in the first seven games that's incredible but on the good side it shows you that close the browns are getting better their clothes but but frustration is they've only been able when one of those four games\nUh and the the the the thing is bad teams find a way to lose\nNow we're we're kinda in the middle with Cleveland because they have to win\nAnd in one ties so they're not as bad as we would think but you can see them doing things down the stretch that hurt them like taking sex or you know the turnover in overtime but they're really kill them\nWhat is it what do we think they need to do to clean that type of behavior well those type of plays up\nThere are still young but today a penalty kill them they took her team got only to the game cost them about a hundred yards and six times they for federalism gave\nThe bucks for its downs and you just can't do that so I think it's a little more discipline they've got a young team I think ... Jackson is got them going in the right direction they they've got to be tough on them though they've got a you know buckle down and realize that they've gotta they've gotta play as clean a game\nThat there's a lot of positives today's game I thought that ... I got better as the game went along I started to connect with drivers Landry that was a great sign\nA used on the job of a second round draft pick and at a rookie running back have a strong game so that's a bright future there so a lot of good things for the brown but they're not there yet they're still young and they're making\nA mistake and unfortunately they're paying for some of those are the stakes\nSam Rosen is our guest of course was on the call for ... books and just listening to me feel like a game is about to happen right now just listen to his voice said let me let me go to the other side of the winning side which the buccaneers this has been an interesting team I started off hot and\nRyan's fitzpatrick became fits magic and then all of a sudden it goes downhill and now you got James Winston back and he didn't have a great game but he made some place down the stretch and they also are was able to run the ball a lot fifty five yards a touchdown\nWhen you watch to see what do you see do you see the team as maybe closest to the first ... team that's just struggling and it just may end up being five hundred this year\nI think probably close to five hundred because the ads for the fences side of the ball which could hurt a looks like a journal McCourt might be out for a couple of weeks\nQuandary Alexander got hurt in today's game they'll know how how long he might be out\nBut uh if it's a knee they could be a while so they've lost the guy's a joy injury but they've got some good things going for Jay rich\nAre started off the game he looked great he was sitting every receiver connected with ten different receivers in the game he passed for over three hundred yards but he's got this little ...\nSometimes you make a couple of bad passes a cost of last week against that land are with two interceptions and it hurt the team this week at almost was devastating that'd be true true interceptions today but uh they were able to overcome it so and they still got to figure out what they want to do with the character at times\nKevin zero wins the game with a fifty nine yard field goal it's incredible but he also just an extra point that story and then he misses a game winning field goal from forty yards out so they got to figure out what they want to do with him\nSpeaking of James ... the the thing we know yes the town we've ... we saw it in Kabul\nAnd they were saying that the Vikings they'll they'll be able to right the ship that defense will get it right and they were able to do that this week for the most part talking about the defense and what you saw from them\nYeah they are they actually had a couple of injury late Anthony part a bureaus two guys are playing pretty well when you look at\nBut also to eat or they haven't talked about both both in his point was that maybe it was this poll up and try to do much so that the old five things a little bit and they're playing a lot faster and play in a lot smarter than that given up as many jumped place\nA so offensively for the Vikings Kurt ... seems to be the real deal or that team of galvanized in in in in just a heat galvanize that team brings them together tell me the importance of having\nYou know a prolific passer like him in that all fence to compliment the defense\nOr millions of dollars open to a real real real [laughter]\nI think he's pretty well obviously you have guys like you and then they had in the run a for seven straight games over a hundred yards today that's a tough match up for everybody else that do that but uh\nThey were able to get the heaviest very much for a very narrow from Oakland is going to be in a nice game today with a couple of long run and so they're getting a little bit more balanced early on in this guy's remember 'cause jak both school and their promise you know what I felt a little less your throat sixty times game\nOr what would you talk about the running game\nLooking at ... Marie is he is he the answer moving forward or is this a matter of we can't wait until we get down and cook back I mean obviously the merrier\nYeah we'll go ahead opting out of a cook guy when he ... he can be a lot of the fact real soon this week though right now you need a one day when he and I think Rick Davis Marie\n... than that perfect one be obviously stepped up ... ... is playing pretty well now they're a little bit more committed to run in football but I think when you talk about the album called\nOh he's just probably a little bit more explosive gave us a little bit more of a threat out of the ... as far as catching a ball\nLet's let's talk about ah the jets and the uh trials and tribulations of of one them darnel or he had the turnover problems in college she put a lot of balls in the hands of other teams we're seeing the same thing happened to him right now in the pros threw the ball\nAttempted to throw at forty four times today is this a recipe for disaster is this putting him in position to develop bad habits\nWell well no I Know there are playing with backups that receiver right Ravi person going healthy guy at last prior fell off once in a law\nAre they really are starting to get some type of threat is tied in with her and then get out of Miami they can stretch it feels a little bit but when you're ... a year or next red zone particularly for the past few weeks\nOr just couldn't get the ball out today you know when played havoc on both throwing the football but I think seventh Arnold's fires\nBut they're also trying to finish the game where the guys that were just brought up a crack squatters she works at the time and stuff that they're so\nSome of those interceptions aren't on sale because you're around for a receiver rather to twelve ball's going to be high a than a receiver some ... quarterback so\nI I think when you look at the bottom of the east coast all the size and the good quarterback and plus I think we've got three or four key drops in this game today but also hurting\nWell Hey Chris we're up against it so we got to let you go but we appreciate it and safe travels out there thank you you got a record out and up next for the Vikings has got to be the same schools will get a a great ... of a last year who\nPlay off wherever war stuff on digs makes that huge play that will be a good one that you know what the

seven games\nVP right now him home maybe Brady who is that you know I have an ally or a probably a offerings of MVP I mean I Can't think of I mean you got\n... homes right there they'll they'll they're gonna give it to a quarterback that do that I mean the MVP awarded the quarterback award yo no matter what\nHappens that's just how that's how it's ... it's a quarterback\nSleep I didn't even play in the NFL and I was you know so ... you know for you live in and every other position I don't like that it has to just automatically be a quarterback ... seems to be the most important player right now he gives gives out of the passing game is running it's whatever they need blocking\nHe's able to get it done so I'm not saying he has to win it right now but the fact that you know if it's closed which when a running back and a quarter back it has to go to a quarterback right although when Adrian Peterson came back and refer to them you're the man speaking of which Adrian Peterson he is I gave it to ... they did go oh well you knew the sheriff is going to get it right\nThere is no doubt about that the sheriff is going to get that in BP I'll tell you\nYou wouldn't have the skill of the rams game it's in forty niners is thirty two to seven\nRams up yeah that's really really bad thirty to the seven a Seventeen fourteen right now you have the ... the Drew Brees and the ... and the

out for Drew Brees twenty to Seventeen waiting on the extra point and um\nI was just going to ask you something to a couple of quick notes there after coming out of speaking with Alex\nThe rams that twenty four points this game off of turnover that was the first thing I wanted to say and they don't want to go to your guy Blake borders here they just showed us that oblique bottles in these last four games zero passing touchdowns\nFor interceptions in three last fumble a trash a whole lot of trash\nOkay so we're going to get into that we're going to get it as we got a few minutes go ahead\nOkay so when they reach signed him to the fifty three million dollar deal\nAnd may proclaimed that they were going to open the ... for them and we saw this ... you know we\nSaw the first game where they came out against ah the the ... the first time they played\nAgainst New England yeah you're right we saw them open it up and they were like this what we're going to do and playboy was our guy\nAnd and then that war off and you are in a situation now where\nHe was so inept in early in this game that you couldn't continue with him even though you paid him and he is you're starting quarterback\nIf Payton Manning or Andrew look is having a bag game or a bad habit and it never crosses the coaches mine to shake things up often simply and put the backup in\nAnd therein lies the problem that used effort has had some ... first have you know that you've been read right front line I assume that\nHave they ever wanted one time\nTook him out of the game and put someone else and I do not think he's ever been bench for play and that goes to show you the category the Blake borders in as it is in as a starting quarterback\nThat is the only organization doesn't have the trust in him to bounce back from having a poor outing early in the game so right 'cause that's what it's all about I thought about okay you messed up and the first half but let's fix it and let's get back to being you and they\nWeren't even being blown out in this game threat like it was you know like this uh this uh for forty niners rams game where the rams up thirty two to seven over forty nine regions I it it's a blowout let's just take them out they were in this they're relatively in that game or you know against the Texans\nSo let me ask you this then next week they can't go back to ...\nThey can because they're paying them so they can go back they could come out and say look Blake was you know he just wasn't himself or he was himself and we need them to be someone else was biking because they don't have a suitable back or they don't have a guy who keep", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "year": "2018", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "21"}
