jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they\nCan monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so now they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of the constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you\nAbout Saudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might\nMean there is there or dominoes at play here obviously and I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the ministry should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that uh the cars so sugary situation is is tragic uh but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably you know\nIt's been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these\nUh donors in investors to come over and had him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there a lot of technology you they're totally dependent upon our arms of course\nNow they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nAnd and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course their their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that uh\nYou know a friend of my ... you know my friend ... what's the expression and Richard a friend of my enemy is in you know my friend or something like that that the

I Know that you'll be Mr Dodger\nThat lasts like hurt because not only do I thought\nThe Dodgers have the better starter in review against Mali last night you can\nScore first of the top of the first you get the run early\nAnd you start to think All right you know I just start you need and then all of a sudden ... gets bombed and the the brewers tack on and don't use ...\nYeah that's the double whammy the fact that hate or didn't even have to answer into the game because the Dodgers didn't even pose a threat toward the end and the same thing that's been plaguing really both teams throughout the series the Dodgers especially since they live and die by the home run ball most most nights\nHit a couple of guys on base Machado and a couple of guys on base early in the game and of course the fans rightfully so went after him and he struck out a couple of times ah so yeah it it it gave the brewers a little bit more confident going back home getting themselves a victory and now they have all the confidence in the world\nGoing against the rookie Walker bealer a later tonight so it's going to save up to be a pretty entertaining game seven but yeah if you're if you're the Dow did you feel like one got away from your you didn't have the greatest game to start it thought he come back and puts a little bit better or last night and that didn't happen\nAnd they robbers left him in the game and he said we want to have all hands on deck for for a possible game seven we had to have\nReal get us through some of those things they could have easily taken him out when they were down three one it implode it's about five to one before he lasted another inning and they had to take 'em out so this is one of those chess match type of games where\nYou have to get ... out of a guy because you know you have to have save some of your arms for potential game seven so I don't I don't know if I had too much of an issue with it some fans there but I understood why Rob is left them in there\nYou're always going to be interesting because I Am trying to figure out this game tonight and\nThe the hater thing he's so big because he looms you could go they can use it for three any\nNo doubt absolutely you can stretch 'em out like they did in game one\nAnd he has been pitched in four days that's the amazing part of it so easy that plenty plenty of rest they got up and started warming up today but like we mentioned didn't have to use them that's a huge ... to have in your whole for God I can come in you know and if I may have to say they get out to a one or two nothing leads at some point or in game seven later tonight\nI mean you can bring in ... in the middle of lending to know Bridget over to can able and some of your other guys Jeffrey's on the back into the bullying\nFree shot to the plate to try to attack on\nYeah no doubt you didn't necessarily even have to bring them in in the closing or you know seven eight nine situation if you're up by a couple of runs you bring 'em into kind of bridge over the middle endings that's a huge advantage that they have and the Dodgers by the way I haven't used Tim Lee Jansen a whole lot in his theories either now he has been as dynamic as hey there has been this season killing has dealt with his own share of issues\nBut are both guys are both teams I should say what they're all star relievers or in the fold or should have plenty of ammunition to go on game seven so uh she'll be a good one\nSo fate you take the matter I still at the Dodgers\nTo be honest with you there battle is asked it they've been there before a Walker below nothing phases him the guy the guy's unflappable he's a very calm under pressure I Know he got rough up in the early and he's in his start against the Atlanta Braves before you settle down in ... and retired I Believe Thirteen consecutive batters after he got out to a\nA five nothing deficit so he's not someone he gets rocked and has has has confidence shot early so I think he's going to be ready to go in game seven it's just a matter of those bad stringing says some heads together like they were able to do in game five\nAnd that swing for the fences or the doctors could find a way to do that which I Believe they will I think the wind up coming out with a victory in game seven so that that's my my original prediction was the Dodgers alliance six games or something just gotta extended want more and give it give it to him\nI like a lawyer I like it broke I like it you know a real quick Tio a subject I Need to get\nThis shirt\nMuch figured feeling that Lincoln has his shirt\nOh say how many freaking Kennedy [laughter] you're freaking today that's amazing [laughter] are you\nYeah [laughter] that's pretty sweet little story behind that first of\nAll I Need this shirt off hours have to have this shirt [laughter] I I I have a picture of what gave me what is the car\nOr you may not be die piece on his on may may not be\nBut he's got his shirt because she's licking freaky academy on\nA lot of work that shirt were crazy\n[laughter] sure cause you're\nAlready in the other side you know we've got you live oh well we got to really do is just to me a couple of years ago was that somebody had asked when I was at an event\nYou know who are you are you and the the guy was standing next to me or one of the fence is trying to get out of ... like you know that is as Lincoln Kennedy so I Know there's one guy in Jacksonville gave me a shirt and so now when I Do a parent's is I like to whereas in all the fun adjust so yeah it was a Lincoln fridge and\nGet it

I Want to give it to\nCertainly but ah I I look covered this first second Michael what'd you think it is\nI think it's truly bizarre I think it's truly one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen because you guys know me I'm a fan through and through and even as the Cavs fan while you're squad right yeah and I mean\nIt it was actually more competitive game then probably in should've been I mean they were pulling them out and then all of a sudden the cabs are within a few points at the end of the game but it's like\nJimmy Butler said he didn't want to be there like make up your mind I hear you might make up your mind what you want to do bad like you you you can't be the guy that goes yeah I Want to boot him I I don't like him and then what two\nHours later you're like yeah he's the greatest thing ever he's the MVP he's like yeah it's going to make that doesn't make any sense either doesn't make any sense it's like it's like it's like Oklahoma City thunder fans like immediately like OK though he Kevin direct comes back in the warriors Jersey and they're like yeah\nThank you for all the great time it's like it doesn't make any sense\nNo no it's ... it's ... it was completely bizarre I mean not for profit fake how the world you can you cheer him after you bowl\nLike I'll get I I don't do that\nVery bizarre\n[laughter] as I have no way to describe it except it's extremely bizarre I don't know how you can have that within yourself to be able to do that doesn't make sense to me I'd rather just be silent descent and cheer him exactly show supply I Want to talk about fence covered up worthy fell was always [noise]\n\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping\nYou see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium Web\nDesign with exclusive smart to know your brain must be to Michelin laid switched to the curb\nGiving you unparalleled streak free long lasting all these reforms\nSo when the going\nA different you can see bill ... boys that was on another find retailers\nGeico presents I witnessed interviews with inanimate objects\nDidn't belong to college in line on the the never return health storm here to describe the events\nAll pro I was just hanging on the roof when it's normally storm starts dropping baseball sized shingles got feed off of you know what the broken Savage did you do anything to help\nNobre I was in survival mode your football can help you win a hailstorm but the guy go insurance agency can help you get covered for personal property damage go guy go to see how it for double homeowner's insurance and non sports\nFor South east Texas online and on the air and you saw five sixty five home I I hardly [noise]\n\nFunny one I'm Pam who sell stocks new is a billion dollar deal over happens next week [noise]\nPoor little porn star all she wanted was some extortion money\nOn top of it all justice Brett Kavanaugh now sits on the U.S Supreme Court with his little copy of the U.S constitution snugly in his pocket oh by the U.S constitution\nIsn't that the out day to document the Democrats want to destroy guests they'll have to\nWait longer maybe like another millennium or so the hope for billing way doesn't seem to be materialized sing for a Democrat mid term takeover of Congress even though that's what the news media keeps telling you\nAnd the U.S economy what about the economy well it's still booming what's a poor radical Democrat left to do on top of all that that just ... just about\nEveryone in the United states has more Native American DNA coursing through their veins and Elizabeth Warren does\nWhat a blow to all the radical Democrats out there and now I suppose the anti American radicals\nHave little left or new but continue to have their extended temper tantrum and possibly go to the streets and cause more chaos\nEven ... Robert Mueller's mosh deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein is probably and bigger trouble than motives being reported he signed off on one of those tainted Pfizer Lawrence was very likely part of the plot to unseat President Trump\nAt best ease ethically challenged for not recusing himself from the smaller probe at worst\nHe was part of the failed coup to remove President Trump from office Rosenstein appointed Mueller to investigate President Trump for foreign\nIn disgraced FBI Director James Comey after Rosenstein himself recommended go need to be fired\nIt didn't DDS indeed the Republicans retain control of both the house and Senate are determined and now season to President Trump will finally be better able to continue draining the swamp\nOf course if you listen to the network news reports they keep telling the American people\nThen it's going to be a blue wave that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives and you know they also told us that Hillary Clinton was going to win the presidency and twenty sixteen so I don't know what polls they take or how lopsided they are but I just don't see it happening that way and I could be wrong but\nI'm just looking at it as best I can\nYou got a booming economy he got more people working than ever so you know are are a handful of radicals going to be able to or overtake the government doesn't seem logical to me\nI'm just I'm just concerned there's a lot of folks moving out of blue states and living in the red states are in fact there was an article ah this past week\nOr affordable migration a goodbye Chicago New York LA hello five cities in Texas and what what you're saying is is people are moving out of these out of these blue bastions of\nA utopian a vision but a devastation\nFor housing you have such a such a discrepancy between what what housing costs where people actually want to live and\nAnd the affordability you have a lot of middle class folks moving out of these areas and moving the taxes you see amazing expanse in the Dallas Fort Worth area you see a real estate prices going crazy all over taxes especially you know DFW and also\nIn a in the Austin area so let's just hope you know there there's a lot of talk about turning taxes blue\nWhile I was just I'm just I'm just afraid that that some of these folks will not understand that it's their politics stupid that causes you know these things to happen in those blue states that they're playing now that I mean there's a story last week that the uh uh\nThe average New Yorker pays thirty percent more in taxes than the national average\nWhat you can have all these utopian programs that you want to have but they cost money and eventually you know you run out of the other guys money\nI
