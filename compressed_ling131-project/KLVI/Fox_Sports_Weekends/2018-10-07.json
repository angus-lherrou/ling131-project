I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well it's an excellent question you know I think that um you know ... ...\n... mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum when it was like a dress up like a dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a ghost you know where you\nGot like holographic you got to that because if he had that in his late this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to are asking about the the panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is really rude tonight\nNever missed a detail on a short just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free and goes to ...\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their seal you already are using\nMiss the iconic performances\n\nKill me I ... I heard when you\n\nWalk for trending\nStandards for Texas you remember Andy were Vince Young is running against what was thought to be the greatest team and the history of college football in USC and Vince Young proved otherwise in the national championship game so\nTo say Texas is back to that standard we heard this all the time with the EU with Miami last year in their research into the U.S back in the U.S nowhere close to being back to where they once were so I think that the standards for taxes you can't say they're back based on a win against Oklahoma who\nThey very well could drop a couple of other games before it's all said and done this year\nI mean it is a heck of a when it is it's a tremendous when really Oklahoma three ton defending twelve champion I mean really truly this is a big win for Herman probably the biggest wind in his career biggest with ... yeah I mean I tell you what this this game does\nI think ... the quarterback of Oklahoma Idaho Heisman intentioned it really does\nI wouldn't go that far it hurt it hurts big time because I don't know where the loss is going to be for Alabama and ... by lowering has been spectacular and one to to schedule gets a little bit tougher maybe we'll see him in the second half you know the numbers get a little bit healthier so that hurt Tyler Murray\nHe's still did play well just sixty seven yard touchdown run was amazing the fumble hurt when he was scrambling around and you know uh you know like had the ball on the ground you trying to gain regained his balance and he fumbled that was a bad turn over\nBut all things considered I still think that he's in the mix\nBut you know what Texas I don't want a twisted that's an enormous when I'm just sitting here telling you I don't think that's a win where you say for sure Tom Herman got Texas they're back they dropped the first cable against may early on and we can't forget that\nAnd they got a big games on the schedule down the road plus they got Oklahoma State and I\nI think Oklahoma State you don't know what you're going to get a week to week last time I was there yesterday in Stillwater but still and all that they've Oklahoma State to the explosive ball club and I think that right now Texas will face a couple of hurdles before the end of the year but I got to talk about the big blue and we talked about unless we talk about Kentucky we talked about them but we do go\nSurprise team they went the distance with a and M. and a and M.

it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance with Geico got a guy called dot com oh call eight hundred nine four seven or do they only hard part figuring out\nWhich way is easier and by the way and about ten minutes from now Bronx talk radio which Sammy K. right here on Fox Sports radio so how do you like that is to know how do you like that\nAlways looking forward to it man always on the street yes\nYou know to treat working with you it it really is because you appreciate the world is sports there's not many people out they could really say I appreciate a great performance and you do you know what to some extent at times I think I Do as well and today we'll get a C. hopefully a great performance\nFrom the Kansas City chiefs 'cause they're undefeated foreign oh they hosted jags three at one end this Patrick homes the quarterback that achieves a great story I just read the sports illustrated like to share with you if I can I don't know how many people read it he played football the White House high school in Texas\nAnd Sports Illustrated story goes his mom Randy and that's Randy with an eye city nearly quit football the some before his junior year of high school because\nHe felt he didn't get a fair shot at the position he wanted which was quarterback he played safety is a sophomore and I had no idea he was drafted by the Detroit Tigers and the thirty seventh round of the twenty fourteen and I'll be draft what a story that is\nYeah well he's off to a fantastic start there is no doubt fourteen touchdowns no interceptions but\nThis is a step up significantly and defenses that he's faced the far\nAnd I'm really really curious how he plays today against Jacksonville because it's the number one scoring often in Kansas City just over thirty six points per game and you get the number one scoring defense in Jacksonville only allowing fourteen points per game\nSo as we always like Sandy something Scott I guess and I think this is going to be a fantastic I I mean this is the master but the day but ... ... homes in that Kansas City often says going up against that jaguars defense I cannot wait to see that I think Patrick ... give you a prediction Andy\nI think my home's throws his first pick today I don't think he's still have with zero in the interception column when this thing is done\nWell I think that right now I think the chiefs Stevens has to be tested I mean they've given up so many yards and so many points those far and they want it on the arm of Patrick my homeless but here's the key can the cheap stuff they're running game of the Jazz Can they stop limited for net that's the\n... doubt so yeah I Am an issue yes so I thought it was going to be\nDJ yelled in you're going to be that it's gonna be a little bit running back by committee but they can still run the ball effectively look at the chief defund they're allowing a league high five point seven three yards per Kerry and this is short week so\nYou got that going on you think about that she was playing on Monday Night football and they've been playing atrocious defense chest smelly stinky nasty defense and the ... yes it's been brutal man where they think about this and the I Love doing this because\nWhile the chiefs I haven't had thereby week I Love looking at the total yards given up for the entire season you've got the patriots who you wouldn't say they've been world leaders defensively right right right you've got the patriots right now\nPlaying an extra game compared to the chiefs write\nThe patriots have given up to one eighty three more yards this year\nThan the chiefs you think there's a chance that uh the jags gained twenty four yards at least today total oh I was a good chance so when this is all said and done you're going to the Kansas City on the bottom again most likely in terms of just given up\nOn I'm going to go back and I'm Glad you told me this I didn't know limit for net will be out today but now I'm hearing from our produce that is that we have several weeks with a hamstring\nAnd I and I thought that like when the last time I looked or heard that he might be available for today and now they say it'll be several weeks without hamstring I mean I I had no idea but that really to me maybe I'm wrong I don't think it was a well publicized I thought he might be in the lineup today\nAre you using a different Internet Andy [laughter]\nLike a different a Web browser or something\nI thought it was that I'm Glad I'm not betting on this game and the honest [laughter] [laughter] well I guess when you go yeah they can\nStill against that they can still have a lot of success against that Kansas City defense regardless if it's TJ yelled in or Leonard for net a healthy writer for net is dynamic there's no doubt but it's not like that ground game has no chance to do anything whatsoever against the Casey rush defense he's he's just brutal\nThey're bright all against the run so I think that you can absolutely have success against them when it comes to the combination TJ yelled and it's going to get the bulk loaded the carries but you got to see some Corey Grant\nOn drafted free agent out of\nAuburn you know he's been in the league for a couple of years\nSo I yeah you can you can still match points against that case the defense it's just one of these where and later for nets had a lotta nagging injuries he missed three starts last season he's got a ... third start this season\nGonna miss more weeks with that nagging hamstring injury so it's unfortunate that that he's a week it's just he just kick it right hell why he's\nThat's what he is he really is you know you look at I think we ... we touched on this last week you look at the chief stats and if you know not looking at the one last record you definitely with it\nAnd here it is that ... is is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders\nFrom the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was\nAll about do you think that maybe the president for the other marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they vote or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report\nHe was skating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not\nThey see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else\nIt doesn't happen to go ... adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing the little Shay and for some of these people to hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying she hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old I'm ... I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a great to have your back\nYet to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nWere coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while they are like a couple of months ago saying that a guy right there because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nKind of white ... ever hang on credit anyway ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class that all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time after him that the cause of what she's been\nTaught and heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe that men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nOr else will rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow the hook it up at a ride by the way here's this you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include all women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats\nAnd the drive by media or making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get notarized after the dates\n[laughter] and you're listening to Rush Limbaugh thin voice on the rise tumbled ... feet met for\nSimply say there's another one of our great success stories fantastic protection\nSimply safe system is easy to use it takes just minutes to set up and they're no contracts you know hitting the twenty four seven monitoring only fourteen Ninety nine a month visits simply safe usa dot com to order your simply safe system now\nMy listeners get ten percent off just go to simply safe usa dot com\nFor ten percent off simply safe U.

Rosen looking pretty good\nAnd even despite you know they're getting that first couple of plays when he came into the game and they said hey man what was it a ... a few games back but now he's a he's doing this thing is he has a team fourteen fourteen six but\nAnother team that I feel like we're not talking about enough is the ... and I actually picked this team to represent the NFC and the super bowl that\nIs the Carolina Panthers a tough when there was a difficult when today a credit the giants were stick it in and hanging in there and finding a way to actually take the lead but then of course the Panthers or when it on a field goal\nUm which is harder to do nowadays even extra points are hard ... I Do know and that's what's funny about it the season has been the year of the kicker one way or the other missing extra points ... missing field goals and you saw Crosby would end up being like one for six today yeah\nI mean my goodness but are they actually get away for the Panthers where are you at what the parents is right now as far as the NFC I mean again I had them\nRead is is that there are three that I Know you had I'm representing their three and one of the things that they don't they don't scare me that is true I'll give you that I I don't I give you that they're going about it\nYou know end up in a in a very pedestrian way you know you know they're just\nThey're winning games no one's looking at um really and then you know and we can you look in about oh snap your evidence three are eight and to you\nKnow what I mean ... that's in sometimes is the season you need you need to focus to be on the rams you need to focus to be on\nOther teams the bill that he could have been the ... come right you know you need that so you can just\nBlock out the noise and just go budget but at the ... the year that they had where they went to the Superbowl they\n... people and you know and they haven't been the same stance and so right now you know winning games like they want a day I mean when we know kicked the sixty three\nAnymore they the more that run the ball thirty eight times they rushed the ball for three\nHundred and twenty yards men that I\nMean I'm trying to think of whatever minds but the last time I mean other than the Vikings and Adrian Peterson where else would you go for it I mean that was like that run a priest home son Alexander member Larry Johnson A L T\nThe there was like that era you guys getting the ball at the minimum thirty five times the game yeah it's just what it was and and one of the plays that are that accounted for those three hundred and twenty three hours with this\nI've had for well just ran Seventy seven yards from a touchdown apologized\nOr in commercial as I say I crawl\nFound laying down the left side of the field he takes [laughter] [noise] and the chips or an extra point away from time again\nHe was just it was just radio network Baron ... is that they went to a commercial though on the other work editor Marshall break while the touchdown happen came back you hear them cut the commercial halfway off and he's like yeah that was a touchdown\nBy the way who ... who ... who either got fired or who got suspended\nFrom something that something that they miss time that they did a but man I'm telling you I was laughing at this because uh yesterday was doing the show or that it was the apartment and we're talking about just the fact that whatever happened to the future back remember growing up you knew all the features\nBack of course in the and the uh obviously a married man of Emmett Smith Irma Thomas I mean ... I mean he had all these great names that you knew like autumn bill ... new there even get home all twenty\nFive thirty times at least some games even more and and it's gone now we're talking about

fifty sixty Seventy times when he two times the only two times we're going to have you throw a and so we're going to Russia for thirty eight the tips three hundred and twenty three yards as crazy I mean that's what look ... look on the\nFlipside of that look would the Denver Broncos did they ran the ball Seventeen times\nThere's a huge disparity case Keenan another one of those guys you don't want you to ... the one time\nThat's not what you're telling me that is a recipe for disaster any of the top elite elite quarterback they throw the ball as much as they want if you want to Tom ready

rookie\nQuarterback Sam dawn on a situation like that are bigger may feel or Josh Allen because they're not used to and they don't have the tools to not only not make mistakes when you're throwing the ball that won't look when you throw the ball we pass the ball\nThree things can happen in two of them were bet\nThat's true right there do you ... it's all about me as a coach you want to increase your odds of being positive that's why stain on target in the running game or so important because you don't put your young quarterback in third and long situation it's just impossible to to recover

same page and obviously even the running gay with maybe on bill not being there and people are questioning whether they'd be able to get it going they actually do those questions today in the big one most importantly is long connection with Antonio Brown and been rocks burger\nYeah you know one after the game I don't know if you saw that Antonio Brown actually I Believe brought out before the wide receivers I'm Still a roster to the podium within\nA you know which was I might find a team unity because\nIn my opinion Antonio was talking a little bit of me earlier this week rather than team you know what I mean and it's his issues\nWith Ben Roethlisberger you're talking about a quarterback who's leading the NFL in passing he's distributing the football to others he's helping to soften portion Antonio feeling like he's not getting his when he got his today\nPerfect opponent to play the Atlanta Falcons are an absolute train wreck now on the east coast which side of the football in their secondary and you know if it was interesting I was asked a sporting event you know by Brian Andy about whether this was a\nMust win game for which team would I say it's a must win game for ... and I said it was really more of a must win game for for Pittsburgh because they were coming apart at the same to you know what I'm saying you know a lot of outside talk again all this controversy they needed to get a win to get this you know to get things going in the right direction their defense do isn't perfect but the office was clicking Antonio Brown big day\nAnd that once the ... the lead on top of the rams right now twenty four seven tennis ball game is also on Fox cardinals fourteen forty niners just six ... cowboys and Texans from Houston earlier today in Cleveland\nWhen it

today\nA couple of phone calls from Aaron Rodgers Mason Crosby was one for five on field goal tries\nMississippi the Green Bay lose at Detroit thirty one twenty three Kansas City thirty to fourteen over the jaguars and the major league baseball looks like it's a limitation time for the Colorado Rockies they're down to in the series the best the five to Milwaukee\nAnd Milwaukee leads right now for nothing bottom of the six Dodgers trying to eliminate the Braves tonight\nFirst pitches a eight oh seven eastern on at best one of the Walker viewer in the pitching match a person's Sean nukem for Atlanta guys back to you\nThank you ... a ... a mentioned something that we haven't got into but it reminds me of a kind of how you feel about the chargers I think there is another team similar\nAnd that will be the bangles yeah where it's yeah okay you know we've been here before where they have had some good seasons we been here before we say and they don't really play well we've been here before we say AJ green or is you know at one of the top three for receivers in the game\nBut then they don't do anything in the postseason were waiting all are waiting for with them but part of our job is to discuss what happened earlier to games and again if he for saloncom and Washington with you on\nFox football Sundays company live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance with a guy go go to a guy called ... eight hundred nine four seven auto the all the hard part figuring out which way\nIs easier but\nAs he mentioned twenty four points with the bangles in the fourth quarter\nYeah that was a that was impressive and uh the red rifle [laughter] got to pop in and and but you look at\nAt Cincinnati and like you said no one's talking about it right because we've seen this we read this book before right\nYeah we were we were we weren't in our lives and what we're doing what you read ST BOOK over and over and\nI'm done I already know how it in [laughter] and it's up to them to rewrite the ending of this book but it's also familiar to all of us\nYou know who has the same book that I feel like I've read over and over and that's ... ... yeah\nI mean it's a Dr seuss scat and they had like I Know what's going on here one fish blue fish redfish some fish okay I Know what's going on here whitefish\nTwo fish redfish redfish intersection at ...\nAnd then\nTo fish for fish safe for how do you have a six a couple of 'em in the game so um\nMiami Dolphins when they invested in Ryan tannahill everyone went\nHome\nThat was like the current cousins of like eight years ago right where you go maybe her cut is better\nThan Ryan ten whoever was to to justify the money\nYeah I agree occurred cousins is better than right down the hill and it would just to the point where it was just like\nOkay\nAfter your three if we don't see the steps we need to make them a franchise quarterback than we've got to start thinking about moving on but\nThen you know you heard in\nThe OJ Cutler comes in and ... it's just you know\nIt's the bagels and it's the dolphins and that's why we haven't talked about that game yeah to strip the earthly reason again we are talking about because it's close to it as exciting and it is a division game and that is the rams and the sea hawks ramps just getting tired girlie\nA run for about three yard touchdown run their wedding on this extra point because the way these extra points are set up\nTo see that you never know I'm gonna wait here two seconds to see if it's good it's up your hands ... barely made it and it's good twenty four tight in this game five left for the third or talk girlie again looking looking really good\nAnd it's amazing the way also how they used ... by the way because you forget ... Gurley if you need to you can load up in twenty five thirty times you can\nGo in there at all you can do he's one of those guys we talked about earlier that they're not a lot of them in the league\nHe's a bill Carrey you got the ball you can comment about twenty five thirty times a game and he gets stronger as defenders get tired and and and you know\nAnd and weaker throughout the course of the games on the fourth quarter he's a big deal he's able to do and accomplish a lot\nThe best the best part about this for the rams they haven't had to use him like that right so as you mentioned later on during the season let's say come we ate and you're like oh we need some teams you know maybe the games are tighter or some of these teams have a you know you're better off running against and maybe they have explosives office that's what he's got to be fresh he's\nGoing to have it you know he's 'cause he's not being used thirty thirty five times just simply running it I mean yeah he gets the ball definitely in the back to it as a receiver but they're not running the ball thirty thirty five times with him beating them down wearing them down so I think he's going to be for a second half of the season when they really may decide to start going to have some more\nUm interesting it'd be interesting to see that for sure the writers are down here\nAnd soul\nNo signal yet looks like maybe they were stopped short the one yard line trying to score touched down here against the charges charges up twenty six to three up big on the raiders man tough season right now for the raiders as we mentioned there one in three looks either going to want it for and it could have been on five it's a browser get robbed last week\nUm do you think about that they're going to have a extremely high draft pick if this continues\nWhy would be wide open touchdown oh because it looks like a tight in was wide open on the outside to hurry up got the ball right as the er the ref set the ball down and they hike it and they just do it all the way out to the rise with that title was joining us it could be joining us I couldn't see yes already Nelson\nWhy how joining Nelson\nWide open\nBecause I Want to see the replay how this happened so again they got down to the one that was not a touchdown they broke the huddle nobody went over the huddle in yeah just for some reason the best receiver maybe the best receive are the two teams Keenan Allen may feel differently from the city wide open\nAnd they scored a touchdown and fill it rivers despite having currently a Seventeen point lead waiting on the on ... an suing extra point\nHe wasn't happy about that now he's mad because that shouldn't happen right no matter how fast the team\nGoes and gets up to the line you have responsibility so as a quarterback you look\nOh there's a receiver out here that just a receiver though Jody Nelson their best to reverse it only takes\nSaying now they they wouldn't want a play called that was a hard\nNoticing that his receiver was uncovered so he came up in their Peter Peter Peter snap the ball quick\nJust toss it out there nobody was move nobody else move off into want nobody move that's one of those you know\nType play calls\nThen when you see something that the defense is given you you exploited\nAh the eagles are on the move right about the twenty a yard line of the Vikings trying to get into the red zone trying to put up some points they have a whole basically a whole fourth quarter left fourteen minutes left and they're down twenty six Vikings up\nBig in this one a couple of touchdowns but you know the way these guys have been going anything is possible we've seen that all day to day we just talking about the bangles could cause for twenty four and the fourth quarter so this uh they're still in this game the eagles especially when you have a quarterback as dynamic as Carson which um he's running hard\nSeahawks the getting the ... twenty four twenty four just under five minutes left in that game big time game for the sea hawks that they're able to pull this out and kind of right the ship if you will get the two and three and have a nice division win against a team that we all pretty much say is the best team in football\nUh and it's been it's been a kind of a different couple of different ways they've done it has just been the Russell Wilson delight\nBut he's so special to me I said this again either a conversation with a local uh Seattle team\nA Seattle radio station and I was told him I said look man they they always ask me this question uh every time we do a do it a couple of times a year they say one guy the whole team coming off the bus you gave we give you a frying pan who's the one guy and knock it out\nAnd I said well you guys are talented right now so I have to go Russell Wilson is because he's the magic man he's still can make things happen and here he is right now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fox Sports Weekends", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "07"}
