I on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what ...\nWhat good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald

stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise than\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those effects of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we used to or she real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but the other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to that says\nTo the fed and and uh John John Powell why take in a punch bowl away from this party just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation novel evolution watcher guy I was I\nWas really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and and the tax breaks and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong and I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and\nThe truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I I my only point is I just think the fat\nAct preemptively prematurely and raising rates in in a in a way that wasn't that search I Am a little concerned by the way to go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like a club on a four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why\nHas it gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nYou there is too soon are you there yeah

stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know this the stock market is driven by fear and greed [laughter] that's a truism for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and then by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred\nI said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter]\nWas Ronald Reagan and we had Nineteen percent interest rates right shortly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lotta people say it's\nIt's it's a a you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the\nPresident is the chief executive officer of the country right he is the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out I'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct\nI I think there's a lot of ... one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or a falls on high at the fed they act as if there was a temple with\nAll of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes over here and you mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had\nLiterally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because the fed mistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in two thousand seven and they said we keep thinking these people are somehow like\nJobs like I don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nOr and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China I I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not\nThat this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it Stephen [noise]\nThat's what he really fundamentally believes that terrorists are good\n[laughter] here's my view and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look\nI Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of a top elliptical view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals you got to deal with Mexico we play candidate like a federal here where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before the\nThe deal will have to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and this is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using that's all I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China then I'll let\nMe challenge you on that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about that it's like if we can't trade with China we'd sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets mean damn near everything you buy and Walmart young made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look\nWe're not going to give you an unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to play by the rules I talked to company CEOs all the time is blind who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market\nYou got to give up ownership of your company you have to give up your a trade secret ...\nI mean we can't live with that is right I'd write when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big they also weren't our bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you know you probably have a gotten a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs in these things going on of allies or any like Canada and ... as a way of\nNegotiating bring these countries to the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA to point out type of situation well that happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nWell this is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but\nI I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum tariffs or auto tourists but especially not steel and aluminum because you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto\nBut we've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was over it and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make\nA you know Budweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans\nAnd they showed their prices are going up and the judge that's going on around the country our auto producers are autos are more expensive because the steel tariffs so my point to Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of that so I disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good\nLegendary\nMary's my former members want to leave in golden nugget like Charlotte\nHere the song when
