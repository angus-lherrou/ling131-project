they're you know the things that the people that are trying to cover this election and the you know the cabin on things are actually saying I mean they're incredible it's as if they don't care\nFor what the words they're saying I mean\nWell well for instance let's let's use this because we're changing definitions of words are here is um [noise]\nUh here's Brooke Baldwin on CNN they're talking about how we we we've got to be careful because people are going to be hurt because we're we're we're seeing mobs start to form here it is\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without\nA doubt that there's no other way it's going to put a stop on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August ... so that's what we saw chasing we've right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls\nWhat do you call that civil protest or is that a mob I think if he is only a mob yeah and if there was a party or as we call it a ... come on I ... I mean 'cause I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to hang on the laws the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because their votes were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight now I'm trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children\nYou know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and ah was it John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't\nDo you remember where they tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become a violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington DC you would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nAnd by the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like ... cities and they're taking over that's ... that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure\nWe know what we're talking about mob\nMob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble for violence okay and and the quotas a mob of protesters so that their their usage so is this not a disorderly\nCrowd of people that are\nTrying to what it was a ... percent on causing trucking tens on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh's a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not causing trouble I mean if you go to go down that road I guess we are in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're\nRight it just says intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media does not see\nHarassing conservatives has causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a parade see this as like the you know there it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean\nThey are by the Irish guy who runs this overall [laughter] let me tell you these white people then he's older white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay\nSo let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob yes I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtest is guaranteed to a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy\nFor what a mob a protest that looks like he is a matter of fact\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife I only around and said things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his route as he said knock the crap out of them oh what'd you and seriously okay ... I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push\nProtesters guarantee to\nSorry sorry [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] so tell me though\nTill they go anywhere we see this now here's\nHere's the problem let's ratchet things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says ... I think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker sake get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but\nWhat are you guys are realizes that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which basically was nearly killed the guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [noise] basically who's almost killed he was showing this is for health care hit list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and had a wide ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to do things\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually got thing\nGetting their face to realize that they bear some responsibility of this of extra power [noise]\nSo do you remember the time when people like Rick Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target ... district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested from the Tea Party riots mobs\nHow many I don't remember any\nFour hundred just last weekend\nOn the left four hundred that's disorderly that's not a peaceful protest your words\nLearn more about safety was a visit to the museum for more

via broadcasting from American standard bearer dot com studios\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd the ... you know if you look at the [noise] the civil unrest in America and you really look at the history you will find that it is almost always the left and in particular the communist or Marxist left\nThat is behind the civil unrest\nIf you look at a you know here's Seventeen eighty three to Seventeen Ninety nine and you know Eighteen twenty nine to Eighteen fifty the riots and ensue gets that's you know\nA paragraph each but after the communist manifesto well then you start to get some interesting riots usually called strikes now some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these come from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\nHe shows the first ... a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\nClan goes real resurgence and he was heavily involved in it ... to the military and did all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again\nIn the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen onward will that's because of the segregation and all of the things that a progressive planted\nAlright but let me just go through and see if you couldn't find any\nPatterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike the Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike mayday riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike any of those\nSeems a labor related I was the last labor related doesn't it and labor\nWho I'm Sorry if you look these up almost every time you will find the international workers' of the world who\nAre the international workers' of the world that is of course are based\nIn communist yeah Mars his the it is the communist\nArmy here in America the international workers' of the world unite rise up against your oppressors\nYou also had in Nineteen sixteen the preparedness day bombing in San Francisco or you had a um [noise] ah you had read summer which was about twenty of them you had and May Day riots\nYou had the ... massacre was what's interesting is the preparedness day bombing\nThat was the left and communist saying you you can't get involved in the war\nBecause it's so unethical and we're going to bomb you until you stop the best way to say that were icicles with about ... the ... massacre if I'm not mistaken was again the leftists the ... I Can't remember which one it was but it was a communist organization that was against\nA all of the um all of the American legion Z\nAnd they were coming up so they're they they go and they protest I think it was a parade and they actually end up\nRioting and killing people\nOkay good then you look in the Nineteen thirties and forties\nIt's a ... century earlier was a an industrial workers of the world\nIs by ... thank you okay Minneapolis or Minneapolis Teamsters strike Nineteen thirty for the auto light strike the west coast long shore to strike do you even know what that one was\nThat when that happened that may ninth through October twelfth that one's shutdown San Francisco bay or the ports in California Portland and Seattle ... and who was behind that one\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit\nDown strike the battle of the overpass the republic steel strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots have communist and Marxist fingerprints on them\nI said it's it's fundamental to the ideology right rebel yesterday is fundamental to the ideology source and not surprising that this was happening\nAgain so I just I'm I'm really tired of of sharing a or I should say it this way I'm really tired of the media and there lies\nAnd will stand\nYou just seem to want to fight I Am not with you I\nLook to win [noise] gland\nDid you missed any of the show today [laughter] no problem ... dot com slash contest to listen on demand whenever and wherever you are free that's Clinton backed dot com slash part gas [noise]\nBack years on used on five sixty Kaomi I", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "14"}
