S. dribs numbers have snowball since about a hundred and sixty departed friday from San Pedro Sula Honduras with many people joining spontaneously carrying just a few belongings\nA Guatemalan priest estimated more than two thousand had been fed at a Roman Catholic church\nThat we are three weeks before the midterms\nThe caravan elicited a tough response from Trump saying the United states has strongly informed the president of Honduras that if the large caravan of people heading to the U. S. is not stop and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Hondurans\nAnd if you start to feel too sorry for him just remember this\nThat the policy change that Trump is enacted has sparked fear of using federal aid\nThose from Honduras are now afraid to take their cards for public assistance fearing that the government would use it against them maybe even take the cart away one of the fact the status which you got to realize is when these people get here\nThey have no job they have no home they have no food they have no schooling they have no clothes and so guess what uncle sugar has got to go ahead and do everything for him\nDropping registration now would replace the current guidelines with stricter ones under the proposal\nEnrollment in one or more\nPublic benefits in the previous three years would be considered a heavily weighted negative factor in the quest for legal residency\nNow you got to remember that schooling is necessary bilingual\nTeachers will be necessary even more so\nIn addition to that you'll have to have housing\nYou'll have to have jobs or else they're going to become members of an is Thirteen or at least some well they're gonna have to have food they're going to have to have medical care\nMany of them will be pregnant or are pregnant they'll have to have hospital care they'll have to have child care and guess who's back this is on it's on your back\nAnd it's on my back\nAnd so while we all think about generosity and how nice it would be to let these people leave the unbelievable circumstances that they are and and they are in tough circumstances\nThey're making their way across Mexico not staying in Mexico but making their way to the U. S. borders because what the welcome arms of many in this country who do not realize what they're taking on\nIt's the same thing as if you take on a dog that Brianna was here with the dog this morning\nBeautiful dog is going to take care for that dog dogs are going to have to be fed dogs are going to happy watered Dr ... it's going to have to have it shots it's going to have a place to stay you cannot abuse it\nAnd so you're taking on an obligation with a dog like that of ten to Fifteen Years you're taking on an obligation with some of these families of twenty five and Thirty years and a couple of generations because not only of the kids coming but their moms and dads are coming in many cases social grandma and grandpa coming\nSo you need to think about it long and hard with a heavy heart maybe but think about it who pays for it\nThe first time I ever shopped at ...

E. L. V. I.\nX. people before too when we were ready to buy a new a used car has a car to enjoy more confident car buying experience\nWhat the number one selling truck in the world is\nOr you know it's a Ford F. one fifty we've got 'em over again so that was kind of sort of the birthplace in Beaumont of the Ford F. one fifty because we were here when none of the other guys were\nWere for families deep in tradition and we know very very well that when you walk through our poodles at kids you're looking for a great vehicle at a great price and you want to get treated like your money is good would you ditch\nSo maybe that's why we're still around after four generations because we know all about this we knew how to treat people the vehicle is one thing the treatment along with the vehicle and something else\nAnd this is why we say as we've always say when you come to cancel whether you buy or not we're going to value the fact that you thought of that at all these tax free way Lucas or Delaware county are going now does it for us\nUh we will see you in the morning at nine o'clock a Glenn Beck has next Rush Limbaugh eleven Sean Hannity follows that and our national anthem from the Lumberton high school band [noise]\n[noise] well it's not going to happen I mean [noise] it's a bigger picture first of all back I'm addicted to outrage like you are among\n... addicted to\nOut a ... is ... and I know\nThe bigger picture here is this um the Democratic party\nIs confused now they don't know what to do All right I'm Juanita Broderick claimed that Bill Clinton tried to rape depression never in a million years is going to give that allegation\nAny exposure at all non stop going to happen so you can talk about it I can talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nOr cattle why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality is that is putting herself out there in these positions where she asked the re litigate this stuff\nNow the reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant so she can run again for president\n[laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you\nYou know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am telling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo you know I Know she wants to run do you really think she will\nIt depends depends a lot on Biden\nIt depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against terror is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do with Bill and Hillary Clinton\nThey don't know what to do with them All right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on the road and there and and talk to their\nDevoted supporters this isn't an accident and\nThis is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a great a first lady as she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary's day that's what this is is it ... it up across the country to see\nHow it's going to fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren\nI mean that a non\nAmerican Idol [laughter] know rushed her yeah it's horrible\nCrushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we're uh if you've got a little bit ah blood on an average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves give us a knock it off where she's not Cherokee um this is a total Rosen fraud knock it off\nThe chair and hands themselves crazy\nOK and war and he used that ruse as I say in my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] used the rose to advance their current and academia\n[noise] so [noise] and this is a woman who think she's going to win an election she's not only in Massachusetts and maybe at Oregon you know these days that she can get into the Senate but as a national viable candidate in a way\nBelow as in the ... the number one political strategist a do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I how she got the ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three [laughter]\nAnd she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um she was a chair\nLift just or as a mother or\nYou know was a source of all of this but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is obsessed oh yeah\nAll right John she didn't fit into the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't receive Scully she's\nSome yeah she's a system uh uh Paul would they call in New York ... Paul\nSo but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game but I Would talk to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes or so I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what\nThey may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what he's up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg is going to run for president of the Democratic ticket\nAnd you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg is very smart guy by the way stream Leon ... All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next\nYear I'm ... and older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think at twenty Twenty one I think the only twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock\nAnd it's the it's the reverse you know\nThey're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPerjury near to the you know I'm not sure you need the ah the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I were to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\nJob is smashed that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this was in her time the next time around you want to go up against Trump a friendly doesn't want to do that but it took twenty four absolutely she could or if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about ... ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland more with Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com and don't

saying uh than another Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said\nIt's time to bring the gear teams out for the Republicans I'm\nI mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets\nYou um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\n[noise] why do it peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we'd go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nMaybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper a with five hundred signatures are attached to it\nSo the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ...\nPossible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ashes really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive the most and arch\nElements in our society the press sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize would legalize narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes this the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes\nSo ... that's a big difference we didn't have that what was that a left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's what we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nAh I beg to differ with you on the and the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them and we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say as a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody\nElse will take a cell phone video and throw it out there\nJust would have found is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nViewing that would have to hire security they'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it takes leadership it takes organization but but on the first thing you look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because\nThe press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes you solidly still\nTry to do with Trump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia All right well they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt nuance terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nThey'll make you feel comfortable and it's not a painful experience ... you can even schedule your annual mammograms name with out of the nation for federal un for your piece in line

meeting with the Saudi king and crown prince who promise\nMore than likely the full three years of the ice occupation in Mosul and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because at the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS you know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and\nSo ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so when these people ran away as as a large group ISIS\nMassacred I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by\nISIS hounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and and it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a\nResurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to a saying

sort of in the center\nOf Burma and they want to control all the high lines they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject or surf class you have to basically serve the ... and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more\nTell me what you wrote me so I brought I brought with me several photos have somebody um or his mercy pass their apologize I think okay so I brought with me [noise] several photos\nOf\nOf what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry of of one particular um attack that happened\nUm this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on\nAnd in these photos you see dead civilians you see kids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby and that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and that baby didn't die right away I'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and the army still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time the ... shows up\n\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artists for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the arm army him and his family have fled the Burma Army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the

all lose in the end and I do is the sad part of the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas\nWhere Beto O'Rourke or\nRobert Francis or if you know as his parents wanted him to be known 'em\nIs going by as he used to call themselves call them right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself that's all\nRight so Beto is running here in Texas and if you don't have and you haven't seen that you haven't been watching\nAny national media as far as not just politics I'm outside of that Ellen and cold there and you have an hurry where at CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd that could have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we know this could change\nBut the well they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger\nOn JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have it and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or excuse me fifty two forty five is the is\nThe margin now with cruise leading by seven points to visit from by the way the the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN at their poll think to forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as Eighteen\nI mean that would be a real surprise or no it wouldn't be but you know that's when it is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe or believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won it'd be won by three but I I just think that there is is something\nThat ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I ... I tend\nTo think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here and lack of this\nIs when you buy a much larger margin or ... I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's money by so much heat up by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were evidence that by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results in St Paul is\nIt the thing people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA Greg Abbott that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you think of it break bread country right in Texas ... however are the\nShows the fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance and only forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters words are for\nNine forty eight but still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas look at it this way try this on for size\nOr a Donald\nTrump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I know in talking about the\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life Ted Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "17"}
