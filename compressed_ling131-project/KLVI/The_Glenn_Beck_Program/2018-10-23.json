aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else\nWell what we were trying to do because I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some Russian conservative content so we said\nYou know we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we want to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store\nYou think this is I'm a sort of the first step to be able to counter that suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time

benefits because the view counts go back to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we want to do I'm In this we're we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your content\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is um\n[noise] uh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say hey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together\nUm because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook no we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean\nWe need to be a if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there so how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first kick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with a swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this as a Bernie Sanders ... light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this um and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys name that was all about the contest\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really sweet mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with a contact\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nYou know you can't sell that we can sell the libertarians two ... two older than you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there is a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take\nCharge yeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um an does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who may go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next the conservative or libertarian generation\nSo you're the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you because you know you've consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera but do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no wave\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said all of it you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media saying\nIt's always about local that as a the Kavanaugh saying coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism stock got to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think that Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump\nBut I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nI hate to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up stop it\nI mean I think the president's made it clear where their country of laws or not and it it you know the the ruse that they're using that this is uh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people to their side because now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers well\nThey're asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states is about sending money back to their country uh I don't\nEven know if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the the the the\nPoliticians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba they've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere because they are carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership\nIs I I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico in Mexico was willing to hear my case or process me\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's not this is about politics and who's funding them
