tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening and of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\n... that must be the Mets had guy the police are looking for that

possibility with him that is the military and is it when you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect him most analysts are don't see any mediate\nA risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change\nIn constitution and it is not clear how he would do it he has a\nSuggested that he could create a council that would create a new constitution for Brazil and that would be submitted\nTo a vote for ah after it so and in ... to to people to a electors in general so it\nHe had to to take back this this proposal but\nIt's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office because the fact is that he's not going to debate he uh is giving a\nJust a few interviews and usually he ... the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation from the press\nAnd this ah creates a and unknown territory we don't know what's coming but\nA analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time ... clothing because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in\n... from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governors melody and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know\nExactly what what are those changes um it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\n[noise] uh that ... it ...\nAnd he posted on line a while back a\nPhoto of him and next to Dan in and said that Bannon\nSaid he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this at this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a in a great part of a sudden out of strategy but also not himself a case of public\nAfterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what do we know for a fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ...\nAn expression of this right wing movement in bed with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in that\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's at presidential candidates an a and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow that we don't know exactly at what point\nAre Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAnd now at the end of the month and a on Sunday twenty eighth\nOr will have the final result it's very likely that\nConsidering the current ... bill so now that we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave us an idle fifty nine percent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and a ... a poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight to ferry sure of their votes so we we would have to have a new fact something that would it be strong enough to change the scenario button\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and to find out some more we'll be following okay thank you so much for pre shit okay thank you so much for having me you but\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history or he has\nA he has a a very very strong history\nOf um of dictatorship a love and passion and uh he is not a Donald Trump\nHe's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's changed demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that is really should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobbled together this um populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames and uh what are they what\n... what's you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is the Patriot act\nMake it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with um because I'm In the rest of the world\nThe the believe it or not softness and a tempered Donald Trump doesn't necessarily exist\nAre sponsored this half hour is simply safe simply safe is the way to guard your home to watch over you and your family and it's the craftsmanship\nThe craftsmanship that actually helps um a simply safe beat out all of the other competitors and it makes it all worth it when you when you see simply safe\nUm we're in a proxy war in Yemen with that most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen at their request and they're

money into our banking system a hillside\nThat cool orb that what we should say that's a pretty sweet shore okay the or predict just do we know that they don't ask the or why hasn't anyone interviewed the or about this incident notice how the orbits\nOr shows she stuffed inside of it [laughter] stuff inside of me how they ... they hide so um what is the president do what do we do this why you don't\nGet involved in these things because it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did we don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nIt certainly feels different but couldn't help me quantify the difference here for a minute\nThese regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know bad things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not an innocent of these things yes is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on foreign territory in an embassy is it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happened to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue\nBecause if you can go after a cushion her and and and Trump because of the relationship what ... what do you think I'd say yes on all of that I'd say yes to all of\nThat um I don't think if this guy was a preacher nobody would have been paying attention and then we got one back and no one's yet nobody seem to care of this one because it's one of there's\nA the press cares more about it but also foreign soil and

you know back in the early to thousands you're going to get to a point where if you haven't dealt with these problems it's going to be too late and there isn't going to be a single good option you are not going to like the options\nAnd so right now you have people saying yeah ours is Star Wars we're not going to sell them the arms more got slapped sanctions on they admit this this is horrible and

is a little frightening\nEconomically the Saudi royal uh funds are big\nIn Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons why our stock market is taking a hit at least in the tech sector because they think\nIf this goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where they're going to go to get it now obviously there's other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was a easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that that you know can hurt the industry\nYou also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check on um uh on Iran if they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor in that\nI mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan
