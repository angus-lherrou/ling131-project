{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KLVI", "content": "Right and if they do and by the way I mentioned at the top of the show even there were like five games this week we're the lines really moved one of them was this game people were pounding the Packers as eight nine and a half point dog in fact the line went down to seven and a half or seven points\nAnd now they're down ten\nAs the rams attack on the extra points so\nAnother game was the colds and the raiders game this game started as a pick an suddenly all the money one on the Colts as maybe a three and a half point favorite the Colts have now taken a seven\nPoint lead so this could be a very tough week for Vegas I mean the raiders\n[laughter] by the way speaking of come back we're talking earlier about comebacks Jay Jay y Adrian Peterson ... what about Andrew Luck I mean today and oh yeah absolutely but who at thirty one three touchdowns my reading of play last year and um you know\nFour hundred and sixty ... and they're losing a lot of games but at the same time he is putting up the kind of numbers that we expect a healthy Andrew Luck to put up and he's doing it right now and I called seen as not very good\nYeah he he's definitely I'm putting them great numbers in the fingers hoping that the\nHim and the coats is the emergence of a running game from Marlon Mac\nThey've never had a running game right whether Andrew Luck and\nDoing what and I got drafted abroad and Trent Richard semi right if he has got oh goodness\nBut it's taken a lot of pressure off ... off of him and he's not having to throw the ball forty five sixty forty five fifty sixty times the game he's right at you know thirty one or temps twenty to completion two thirty nine three touchdown\nBuddies him the ball off thirty four times with two hundred and twelve yard\nThat's the recipe that they need to take some of the pressure off and look and now they're ... they're just got to turn over in the island and the raiders getting ready to go in and score again already of thirty five to twenty eight with for Nineteen left in the fourth quarter\nA in Oakland so it looks like the fourth quarter wolves for Oakland continues I think they've been out scored Seventy eight to thirty two and the fourth quarter and that's the worst point differential in the NFL\nAll right so a again a balance of games right now if you decided to go all in on the colds and the Packers the Colts are looking good there about the up their lead but the Packers seemingly in control and that Rand defense has really shut down the Green Bay attack I I think that\nIf you are looking at the rams right now a is they are more money for you to go in the third quarter so it's not over yet because we seen Aaron Rodgers a wait times over the years but if they do at the rams do prevail\nIn this game eight and ... at the halfway point are you still\nAre they the best team are they better than the ... are they better than the patriots are they are better than the saints are certainly can't wait for that gave a preview that the Vikings saints game a little bit later on but are they the best\nTeam I Would I Would say so because when you talking about the best team not the best off into the best defense but the best team you see what\nThe rams have in terms of our fence of weapons with\nYou know would cooks girlie [laughter] everyone got big weapons everywhere but then when you talk about defensive well\nYou know you gotta remember O'Keefe leaves out he's not even he and I went right now but you got Peters you got to sue you got Donald well you have there and done all your exactly and and so when you stack them up against another team they can do it on both sides of the ball and they're one of the few teams in the NFL they're going to make that an assertion\nHigh we mentioned we have a a Sunday night game that could well determine who the second best team in the NFC is right now the Vikings hosting the saint saint seven outlaw since they're opening game what's gonna transpire in that game plus a little thing called the world series\nWe'll crush or keep the Dodgers all live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios yes

remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nAgain in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ...\nSince ... that has changed Democrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight so now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nBe the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... she doesn't six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is a territory that has not been seen before\nAnd you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nNow for a relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing ten feet from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has may even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from\nUm you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of ... oh\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the cab and I'll sing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean\nThey had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat they had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh facing now I mean I think it's a real a real it's\nGoing to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower and high interest then partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kevin I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with them and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know where that four percent jump\nWas it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in\nThe same right and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever write her life like was that being said uh you know I vote Republican I mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter]\nSo I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they do\nFor a Democrat but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent ...\nYeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this out of here gone for good yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\nWhat which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah this this burger yeah definitely we talked about about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ...
