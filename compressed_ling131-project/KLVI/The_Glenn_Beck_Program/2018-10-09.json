[noise]\nOh\nWe\n\nOh\n\n\nThat's what I talk about in the book addicted to outrage and we're taking your calls and questions and comments on it if you have read it uh let me go to Anthony in Massachusetts hello Anthony you're on the Glenn Beck\nProgram Glenn how are you good how are you\nDoing well so you know what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really that the opposition are the people leading the leadership for the Democrat Party or or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party\nAnd what I see happening with my friends on the on the left is there I Would have party members they work every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media and they're being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a poet or the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts are that\nAre I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and peculiar people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the rights punching back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWell they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violence if you see and to ah the way to answer and so far is not\nWith uh the militant people that will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets that is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and\nYou don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is\nGoing to slip away quickly as we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country with those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways to be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where\nEverybody's going to be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility your kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and say no wait don't don't go that way you're not going to stop the whole crowd but you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a book\nOr let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck\nProgram Hi Glenn how are you I'm very good [noise] um\nI overall agree with every book I think it's awesome and I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um you're\nTalking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with everything that you've said that we need to at least have a conversation about\n... because of it yeah and I you know I think we need to be careful about even\nI'm considering the I I think that there really is a fear over a I to try to come in ... and ... that's ... yeah it's I think that they want to push that starts socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and and all the other\nTechnical right on ... ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their ... their problem correct then sell\n'em I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachine that can keep running you know there are certain things I just can't deal like I'm being a fixing up a lake near plumbing in her house probably not going to do that um\nAs far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think many people are going to be upset if they go into the tunnels and not have to deal with anyone\nThat chick fillet isn't known for their service and I ... that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you this first of all just a ... ... ... I don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this I'm a ... what books are you reading on a on a ... or ... or you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than paperwork unless I'm sound coming just ... you know different perspectives are having to sit there for a church that I Know that you have sure on that but you know just my feeling like\nA a I is going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer um quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a\nRobot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so Heather are there is a there is and I can't remember the name of it on the on this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in\nBeing able to reflected in face the reason why I'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection\nUm it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while I'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment but no one has to work that\nEveryone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that through a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to go through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago [noise] the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it is I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou started your comments about the section of the book where I or there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nOr the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hits high unemployment if your goal is one hundred
