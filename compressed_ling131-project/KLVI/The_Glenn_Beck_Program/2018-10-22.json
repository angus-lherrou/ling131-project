...\nAnd I ended up going to one of these pay pay\nOr to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned a lot of fun it was definitely fun fun right hum he misses don't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] you don't have that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took\nThe criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work\nCriticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge like a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big\nProblem and I hope people continue to address it a secondly we decided that that\nUm we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happened so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have\nCome out in the middle that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and\nUh early on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already so he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it's since he's been a recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year or to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nAll the easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project came out and to the public eye took\nMaybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I know you talk to hell in the other day yeah\nUh so I this was in in in the men's amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers of typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work\nThere was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been cut short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten cold\nCase so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA hand to\nHand article where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nYou know and I got to take another break and come back in and finish up why ... why you thought that was important in and go through some of the\nThe other studies are back in the back in just a thing\nBack on news talk five sixty

author of life in light of death\nOr he is a you can follow him at consensual a conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the ... if not the mastermind behind a the a papers a of record that were were being written\nA for for a feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just said this is a start says it's a solid that say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in very privileged a classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way of this will get in we have to temper I thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign teams\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being\nMade uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted and so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil and that's\nThe worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't\nBad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that you would expect out of a\nScholarly papers they claimed for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n... what what if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working and social justice size field topics\nCourses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nDid you missed any of the show today\n[laughter] no problem to the Glenn Beck dot com

cover the field there's going to be a lot more than I think\nUh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nDoes endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill or it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer and now here they are\n... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but\nI just want to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college hey no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can a control everything\nWell then ...\nWhat do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college\nWhich would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about\nThe idea of people being elected right\nI might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump sports at for example throwing um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you can get you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean as you know it'd be which ... who wants that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight let's say you should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or you can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live they\nDon't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's why the house and Senate both exist to to give balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the it out right\nAnd it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the\nUh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed\nBecause there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly then the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics correct I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was under a bronco bottle was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas well you know that's the opposite this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you're just arguing for king right with the the several stories in a row the mic give you the argument for a king\nI mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly you know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods\nWith a a Swiss army knife and saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and slid lumber and this Swiss army knife has\nFailed\nOr no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure park right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented\nBut the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane absolutely insane\nAll right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but that's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the ... the Portland mayor a refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ... can anybody just get up and started directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just\nGo on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic\nMy gosh you might be disappeared [noise] [laughter] I mean especially it was a union job really they wouldn't be enough you'll be in the bottom of the river [laughter]\nWhat what what\nLaws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's\nDriving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young wherever and they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they had a a a law and order march and answer fall showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor ... released\nA statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene\nHow how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess that\nThe just the idea of look this is wrong but we do want to make it any worse he's trying\nTo make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream\nOur police can do no right but they act and they're just sucks they don't act and their do nothing's\nSo they have no way to win\nThe great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do

an end politics is in the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nThey are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics\nBut at what point do you see good people say enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYet but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi in California how are you aware of those did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao in Kentucky exactly latter\nDay because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up and violence and this is not saying by the way that

in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have\nPersuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch heads to a pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really\nBuilt for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of ... restored downtown in Omaha right now and uh there's no end to fire here and yet we got a whole bunch of people\nWho might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy\nSo that it was sixty percent of households that men are basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content ... there was an American way when you fall with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you\nCould still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now and they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should\nDo is ignore them [noise]\nSo what he is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually comeback to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nYes ... a a blurb assume them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity that way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a\nPeople are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers\nDo you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that\nWe can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's\nHappening as the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook

finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined where you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in the school prior to Nineteen eighty and was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information that way but they do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write\nSurvive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked at the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting your son and I was testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not into the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings\nWhich means administrators go away and then it shows what writing grants and many shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that the the two counties across all if you do the full sharply by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than ... than teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shameful by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminish ... over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve ... K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this\nBecause the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college west terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job he is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one of ... told me he says Larry my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\n... that's how bad it is people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to fix that lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator as life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who goes back to the game not sure about the new Dr ... being a female but that's a different\nStory down okay yeah I Do um [noise] so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be boarding school and they should make one school\nNext you don't want any of those things no worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace can become a plumber carpeted whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty\n... that's a problem I'd let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and you'll see the doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learned that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen\nGet some experience\nIt sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth\nGrade I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck here's an here's what I promised going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great trade schools will pop up guess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars he going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to many school pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for these last two years the ... states spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe save all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while\nThey are murders added at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this a lemon twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo believe that isn't there the kids in something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but not he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade discipline problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught\nWhat's killing our children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that killing our kids put them in these worlds all that goes away\nI Can't go shoot my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class I Can't go ... the farm and he's been a fix a tractor I've got things to do I've I've purpose I meaning\nI don't do things like that anymore we're living\nIn a world of massive change yes massive change and when's the last time you heard any politician sound or anything like this

are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system or you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with\nThe big banks mhm er and the big banks are\nCuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to deep platform or people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally an ethical for our governor to impede business period no ... no ... if I don't like in the industry or I don't like something I'd never I just said if I Want to have freedom of speech but\nWhen it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief I should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty an app or who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing that\nOut of it is he's always not only doing that she's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance forest fire on now we can't get it\nThere's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more\nWell how do they mean insurance now when when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nFor any kind a firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yeah and that's the unethical part that's the issue right and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we're having a gun if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passing twenty Thirteen and the the fact said that certain aspects\nOf a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally ... what he decided I think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent felon\nIt was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking the true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the cops words that have been revamped or because of that in other words but it now if you are retired cop went you retire well now you're a felon again\nI'm not going to come up\nThis and this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy ... constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a business man\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over a million since he's attendance thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nRight in it yes it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises to people who work their whole life and were promised ally yep what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas would you please for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you said already already happening every of all the time you're in New York state we are the most
