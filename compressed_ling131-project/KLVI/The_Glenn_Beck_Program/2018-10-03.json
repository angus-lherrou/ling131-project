we had a horse that ran through a bar in Paris you might have seen that on Facebook or on a camel walking around in Illinois\nA Macon county the six year old camel was found during the weekend escape Sunday by breaking through a fence animals you're Turner owners property after a change I guess some people in Illinois like camels\nNot the cigarette but the actual animal [noise]\nI mentioned earlier that the good news from Amazon and others\nThe minimum wage increase will go into effect that Amazon on November first it applies to fulltime part-time and temporary workers at the company it impacts around two hundred and fifty thousand employees and one hundred thousand seasonal staff\nIt's not just workers at Amazon and we're getting a raise the Fifteen dollars an hour minimum will also apply to whole foods employees\nCritics including Senator Bernie Sanders have targeted Amazon in recent months after workers complained of stressful working conditions in low pay\nAmazon senior vice president Jay Carney said they've heard the criticism and that's why they've decided to act\nAs part of our culture to to examine ourselves see if we are doing the right thing and a Senator Sanders was was one of the people we listen to a among many and when we saw the opportunity to raise the wages that Amazon we decided we wanted to lead\nAmazon is among the largest employers in the u._s. it's added more American Jobs in the past decade than any other company a move like this often causes other companies to follow suit in order to compete for employees Carney said that's what they hope will happen\nAnd this is really about America's workforce and uh you know we've seen a\nWages depressed for a long time and they're beginning to end up\nAmazon is also going to begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nYou know at seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour or Amazon Fifteen dollar floor is now more than twice the federal minimum wage and hopefully Congress will take action to raise that\nSenator Sanders introduced a bill last month called the stop base owes act Jeff Bezos founded Amazon the legislation would tax large employers when their workers need to rely on public benefits like food stamps\nWell and and with all due respect to Bernie Sanders that I I don't recall him are making that that much of an issue\nYou are for Amazon a you know and I think the administration does deserve a little credit for this because it's partially due to the economy if the economy was sucking right now Amazon would not be raising wages you didn't see him raise it four years ago eight years ago of course not\nBut it's going to be big seasonal hiring by the way target will hire a hundred and twenty thousand people nationally colds Ninety thousand nationally tally royal\nUm three thousand nationally the gap sixty five thousand nationally so up the hiring or in part due to the fact that retailers expect\nHoliday sales to exceed last year's figures and whatever the proposed amount is they're always crying at the end of the year where we got to be a green Christmas but it wasn't but it was last year and it's getting better this year holiday retail sales expected to grow by about five percent\nSo in other words if you spent just breaking it down realistically if you spent a hundred dollars and obviously we can do more than that but if you spent a hundred dollars you'd spend a hundred and five\nIf you spend five hundred you would spend five fifty and on and on and on so it's good for me when the economy is good it helps everybody there's no doubt about it\n[noise] my friends over a Dakota would have basically the same message they give you every day\nColder winters grow in our news stations garden apartments are nearing we can be a part

of ownership Aaron and I want to get this right Paris or\nThey say for me to ask them to tell me how he feels name it's present a ski person asking how there was a lot easier than it's better than what we can't pronounce the easy word yeah it was going to be there's a lot more than one filled with a lot of there's a lot of confidence there I don't know how you doing there and I'm doing well how are you\nGood I'm I'm a I'm I'm really fascinated by how we make the turns in our society for the future and a ownership is a big part of this because in the future I don't know how many people leaving on cars I mean it's just it's just all changing\nBut do we really own things when we buy them online\nSo I think there's a real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things and digital goods are especially digital books movies music\nThey go into this transaction that soon when they were the same way they do in the in the world of tangible goods where if you buy a book\nYou can give it away to a friend you can lend it to someone you can leave it in your will or in the future and you know a leave your book collection or to or your loved ones\nAnd the rules that control these digital transactions when you buy something on your Kindle or my shows are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes a real disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a a quick example I'm just [noise] um\nA couple of weeks ago I'm a consumer uh a customer of the apple I choose a movie store found that three movies\nPurchased had ... had been deleted from his account there were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people um those of us have been following these issues closely for years would remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted books off of people's candles yams including\nA ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter] 'cause these these issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to really a sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nUh and I read so much I read it all on tend to but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because you watch things like that happening in China if you're ... if you're in China and the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concern\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized\nServers and only the hands of you know the the the two or three companies um that dominate these markets\nThen there's a real risk that uh we aren't going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um the these works\nIn an air and it was the movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are a number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know that the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise]\nUm oh my gosh so they almost force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and the you know fully restored but you still had the old copy\nNow threat you can't ... I mean even for thinking this even just for comparison you can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed ... well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device um and and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you\nCan do the locally many services are often trying to encourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm for with the Apple TV for example\nAt the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of the movie you have to access it through their ... servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded a something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nOr so\nIs it allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nBut because the Kendal is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it would move those files strong\nMuslim affable you talking about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forced everybody to have it exactly\nA bizarre you read about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making provide tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou it it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and\nThen we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and just the\nChange in in capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh schooled mine well I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's a really good [laughter] um and you can buy really factor with gold\nOne thing you could I don't think you can well okay so I Want to tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces are for barter Andrade of sub silver um there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt\nI don't know what's gonna happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean\nThere if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of work together\nFigure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this this bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around\nIt has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and are you going to have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they also do it in gold and it's all made by the royal Canadian meant the only people that carry this is gold\nLine just look at the numbers find out for yourself is the world hurtling towards the fiscal sanity or\nInsanity as soon as a star start rolling the other direction I'll stop talking about this but I don't trust that we have anything that's going to go into um bring us back into sanity other than some sort of catastrophic event gold

was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this was a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it's secret you don't know that it's going on nobody is monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's a real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about a ...\nA about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't like you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the point is it's out in the open you have combat and by the way the fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton\nThat fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted a different\nA real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you not make your algorithm transparent right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back\nDo you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent yes and it's not very good and you know\nThat it's not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peter ... with it and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last\nConversation about\nInformation how do you know that it's true

from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google\nThat you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I Want to I Want to talk to you about the platform me I Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nThat's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah and I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the ... the scope and size that Google has wait a minute how it's it's a ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using a Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but is your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is\nGolf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states\nUse Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert ... signed this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech if you have on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use Gmail well you know\nGoogle is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however they are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research\nSo Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product yeah we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of look\nThere's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of aging how many people it used to look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy picked somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "03"}
