Supreme Court I'm Dave Anthony Fox News and Brett Kavanaugh was not there just eight justices will hear the first two cases the new German starts those hours the FBI continues a week long investigation in capitals second accuser was interviewed yesterday Republican Senator Tom cotton supports the nominee and told CBS\nYeah I mean I have remained the same I haven't changed actually they eat\nPolitical quizzes every now and then and my ideology stayed the same what was happening though is that the the party itself has gone absolutely and I think uh this is not this is not what I signed up for\nRight um I've been watching you on Twitter and you've been um\nDo you want to be only Democrats that have come out and said this is nuts gimme gimme are viewing the lay of the land from a democratic point of view from your point of view\nSure I think it's perfectly legitimate to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's nomination on the basis of differences and judicial philosophy or you know if you believe certain things that he doesn't align with those beliefs let's find out what the democratic process as for\n'em now that being said you you leave it at that right you don't go ahead and try to chop off someone's head\nAnd promote these outrageous accusations against them specifically the the one by this this woman Julie sweat Nick who just don't even ask the snow is I mean we're there they are so absurd I I actually attended an all boys Catholic school too so I can kind of speak to the culture and how\nHow those communities operate I mean the thought that a group of Fifteen year olds would be running a gang rape cartel all throughout high school and that nobody would know anything about it\nUp until now is just it's ludicrous and then that eight and a goal this woman must have been like Twenty years old at the time that this happened achievers frequenting parties with high school sophomore\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man\nOh all me and my buddies we were the college checks were all over [laughter] you know women women usually look for a young man you know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who let's be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete torque when he was when he was in high school this is somebody who kept ... you can see on his talent or he literally has no someone whose parents would ground him\nI mean this guy was a complete ... in high school and he's like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this was great I'm really happy so the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel in\nThe suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on its face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we abandon a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on a matter of faith\nBased on historical hotter of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late that they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things or because you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism and there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right\nIt's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse this is like\nReliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life and they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believe he was a was innocent\nMore than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the un Nicole and they all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that\nSocial justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and it let me tell you I think a doctor's poured who testified she's a serious person she didn't as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt or testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nOr just a it's a series of inconsistencies\nThat would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications ah in political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized or to support\nLook the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what they're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank when he was\nIn college or whatever who cares but it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like reading at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo Shankar what we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who has not lost his footing ah with with reason [noise] um\nSo the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also a a a chance at USCB Cooper right I mean you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a cases based on\nThe ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he is he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right and there is no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is the scope of tore right the the guys calendar clear is that right\nIt's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to cast that aside and then if you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic\nWhere we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way it is is in the court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of one that's happened to four times\nSo I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is to plead guilty by association ride mark judge I I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now and based on\nIs they'll memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person you had a serious drinking issues it's not read ... we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically\nAt Penn State and that's what they do and and and banana republic than a third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second general or do you have to I'm I actually have to run the meeting about okay All right well run to a me we'll talk we'll talk some other time makes you so much [noise]\nI really want to I really want to hear from people\nAh that can respond to what I'm hearing\nFrom the Democrats now which is um um we just have to stop all of these people the people all the people on the all the

important even coming in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats them better Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our potential Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left\nAnd all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] man will be a massive\nA massive culture shock within within the uh the state of the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete rebuild of education\nTo a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay for things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nI next that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with the government is now is they're enforcing the kings well so they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the state government to be I'm the king and I in force my will\nI Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what does that I don't know I Know\nI Know it's I'm not sure it's an old dusty are due to document\nThey regard as they are they I think we sort of the way while ago but yes that's my point I Want\nTo make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met or individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community we don't do that well in the upset at all\nWe have things called regional economic economic development or corporations\nWhich Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent and\nOpened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county how 'bout instead the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concept one\nInstead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation end through lowering spending here's one idea that those both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nOne of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial bridge named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain's named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights of the bridge we retain the asset I got an a business gotten that giving my ass at up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was on the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person Mitt a sixteen million person metro area and\nHundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang on just like a Texas New York's Michael is the Texas you listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but here's the best part now we have them do maintenance\nAgain we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption\nSomeone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now in New York state collapse we don't have enough money these guys do what you have safe or bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes in New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars\nAn hour if you're a truck driver I Know a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy\nFive two hundred bucks to cross the bridge less money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we are running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is I mean this would sell in Texas\nHow do you get them in New York to see guys this this that\nIt's already selling the forward the Republicans in New York have given up I mean they don't show up\nOr the Democrats I think\nAfraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who do vote vote because of fear we can't have fear but the reason why people vote it's simply the wrong answer man\nI Would say that in reality I'm trying to change just to make it so that people stop voting for the lesser of two evils and instead vote for someone and it is working I Am actually using if you've noticed I'm using non traditional media traditionally it does not want to cover me and polls don't want to do with me\nBut not through the media is working and I'm getting out there and people are seeing me they're responding to me and this is what's working their way to make this happen is through non traditional media and believe it or not\nPeople are getting it they actually like it I hear all the time people say Larry I don't agree with everything you're saying but you actually answer questions you actually have a plan and\nThey love it and that's what I say and look my plan may be faulty maybe they will we can't leave all the bridges maybe we can't raise fifty billion maybe go in the race\nThirty million that's still a when you do okay happy with that ... ... and let me ask you can I hold you over for one more break yes okay a oldie over and and tell me how we fix education and higher education\nIt's out of control its its post modernist it's indoctrinate ing and it's in leaving our children to debt when we\nCome back to Larry's sharp I have to tell you if I was living in New York [noise]\nAnd I was a Republican I Can't I cannot imagine a reason\nWhy I Would not vote for him the ... or the ... the Democrat is going to win against the Republican\n... would you not get into this cap and shake things apart Larry
