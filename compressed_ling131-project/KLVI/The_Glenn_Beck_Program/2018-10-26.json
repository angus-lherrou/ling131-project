one of the big network guys he's written a book\nI called the wild ride with Donald Trump and when Jim ahead and talk to them this morning he said what was the first thing that you noticed and that you learn about\nPresident Trump that there's so much that comes with Donald Trump that's right out in front and he doesn't hide things he doesn't speak\nIn a kind of a double talk or synthetic language that a lot of experience and capable politicians use most things about Donald Trump are very visible and in that prologue I take myself to task for not understanding what I could have learned\nJust looking at the words and the sentence you just read I won't give it away 'cause it's an entertaining prologue but I Do take myself to task for not saying hey maybe there's something right here in front of me and if I just spent some time to look and listen and learn\nI'll get ahead of the game it took me many many months of being around Donald Trump to figure out what I look back in retrospect might have been more obvious to me that they spend a little bit more time\nAnd one of the point of the book was Trump's wild ride you'd vote a thank you rally he held in Wisconsin just got signed a bill walkie after he had won the election\nAnd uh you know what the Paul Ryan was around the house be grid not appeared once with Donald Trump during the campaign that is to say the ... running mate had not\nCampaigned with the party's twenty sixteen nominee Ryan shows up there more than seven thousand jubilant Trump supporters including a thousand\nWho would stood in sub freezing temperatures for more than six hours and Ryan says in that crowd of seven does not recognize maybe ten people I've been doing Republican events practically all my life I didn't know any of the beef about Republicans were Trump voters\nAre at the time I said the Republican Party was undergoing a hostile takeover I guess in a way it was\nIt was and it sort of depends on your definition of hostility a as Trump likes to say the rallies are full of spirit and energy and the great fire that he loves in the Trump supporters have this kind of almost ... billion call and response was Trump whether it's the wall or in a much\nMore aggressive sense lock her up really talking about Hillary Clinton but they have this sort of play act relationship is that all hostile\nWell Trump doesn't thanks so Trump supporters do lots of Republicans look askance at and say where directional use is leading us well it let Donald Trump to be the forty fifth grade as the United states and those Trump supporters to identify with the Republican Party at least branded as they see Trump branding it as the new political home the duration of all that\nI don't know I Do not have a unified theory ... about where all this is going\nTo do just try to describe what I've seen what's happened so far and what it might\nMean it's interesting to note that an awful lot of people who were fed up with the conservative politicians who talked conservative but didn't always vote conservative really led to a great extent to the Trump phenomenon and yet that inconsistency which is quite understandable that it did cause consternation among Republican ranks\nUh Donald Trump has shown a great diverse agility of a a convictions over the years of that doesn't seem to bother his supporters as much\nDoesn't bother us support or is he is probably the least evangelical\nA Republican who has been in politics for the last twenty or Thirty years to have as fervent support among evangelical Christians and ... Republicans and conservatives I also point out in the book in one of the most disciplined and focus components of the Trump Administration the federal bench starting with the Supreme Court but appeals court justices and district court judges\nIt is ironic historically ironic that probably the least ideologically grounded conservative in modern Republican Party history is going to be the most successful\nAt re populating the federal bench with hard line conservatives\nVery very interesting for ... sergeant major a major Sargent or not [noise] major Garrett that's his name hey we'll see it

one sent to a democratic senator the other and acts Obama intel official turn Trump credit Fox's Rachel Sutherland does more life from Washington\nState board of national intelligence James Clapper and democratic senator Cory Booker the latest tire did targets in his ... his packages apparently intended for high profile Democrats\nA it was started by what's his fat face loud mouth guy what's his name is do no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose the fight back\nTrumped it and he said I'm not all of these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter they\nSee me as a person who strikes back when attacked so\nI'm going to do that so then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this and you can make a case that\nTrump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow how did he have his own people names yeah he's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your feeling be and kicked to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came\nLater when it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear\nThat's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed and I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him destroy ... that that would be orders that came down\nI'm from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it\nWas very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post\nCNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very ... and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah you know liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights back\nBut now they're turning it around saying well your\nFight back like Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if that fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament\nOh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nThe same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN and we're not responsible for any of it or not us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh how much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five in\nThe New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us\nFrom the job of course they're cartoon bombs they are the only thing it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this is written by mayor yes was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worse the bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt it could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these the depressed we're gonna send these ... all of the all of the enemies of the right candidate or we'll obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms of putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do you do and how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that is why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushed this out pretty quickly ... how would the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out or the or Washington DC think\nTanks progressing think tanks they ... and stuff to Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and\nThese people they get stuff so that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this um maybe the person sending it was insane or you know that kinda thing they'll never say\nWell gee

helped save at least one guy\nChristian\n\n\nChristian as a um [noise]\nAs a man who has gone through a similar situation recently with one of my children\n\nAnd I thank God we caught it before anything happened\nI understand I understand\n\nWe knew the address of the man who um did this to my son\n\nAnd I think if it would have happened wasn't home my wife may have killed him\n\n\nI think about it all the time\nThink about my children\nAll the time and\n\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me I haven't talked to my wife about it\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\nHow we're responsible I had been to not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\n\nThere are things that we don't want to think about that are truly frightening\nAnd I think\nWhen we look at a country when we look and we really realize\n\nWhy do we really stand to lose it's not our job it's about our money it's the unsinkable\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us that happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoid it and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you send somebody if you said to everybody you met in the next two weeks you know you look like you could use some cheering up I think you'd be right about eighty or Ninety percent of the time\n\nAcross all income levels across all colors boundaries\n\nAll struggling with something and we all have something big to forgive man we don't want to\n\nBut the reality is we need each other my kids\nHated the fact that I talked about in ... when they were growing up that endurance was one of the virtues that you had to have or you're not going to make it you have to endure endure life is endurance\nLife is about the long run out the short run endure it to the end they hated that\nThat you're always a pessimistic no I'm not I'm telling you that there's a lot in life that you're going to have to endure that you're going to hate life is not what you think it is when you're a kid it's just not it's harder than that but it's so worth it\n\nBut we need to be like a cross country team\n\nFor going to survive this we don't share the person who came across first we cheer the person who came across the finish line the last as well\n\nBecause we're all different runners we all have different things going on\nAnd it is truly about beating your last time doing just slightly better than you did last time being slightly better than you were yesterday\nAnd if we can help each other and cheer each other on with that\nWill make it\nAnd it gets harder and harder every day\n\nIn the hopes that somebody that\nIs a product of the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are creating this\nUm and you know it's not going to stop until both sides realize it until the media says okay wait a minute\nWhat do we do what did we do that makes you think that we're the enemy what did we do and actually listen to half the country\nThen we can move forward and create a better tomorrow\nIn his own used on mine sixty Kaomi I\nI said to be guilty I sure shouted one
