all that but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example maybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you\nHow the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the

there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blow their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the

accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the cabin occasionally I was a case\nOf the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's the one difference\n... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between a word and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those so the little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor\nGets it wrong of course well yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do get around those cases yeah the the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries ah um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction\nBetween those two things one has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually leading me\nYeah and she and you know and and one in one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident [noise] um and it has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening that people Ford named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key thousands a girlfriend has also are named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax um\nWritings um the pictures and those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real tired\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but but but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nOtherwise you get your tape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the analyst with ... and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the four case so we have like we have them out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case the however", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city":
