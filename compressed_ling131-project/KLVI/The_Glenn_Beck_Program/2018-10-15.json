worst heads that surge just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage kind of a nice time you could talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nKnow it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and I you know Rachel\nOutrageous in headlines of articles all the time\nBut it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case talking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage and I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think\nYou know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged his response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges as Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel right I Know we are there's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but it but I but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it\nWe have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nBeing lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened we're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there challenges\nBut this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nThink ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're up to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nNot participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically\nWere winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know are trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another we're\nJust being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have the kind of you know they're the go those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life\nAnd then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some some self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nAnd Christians in the age of outrageous is to\nI used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and an income for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategic lean you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus ...\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling who are we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back in just a second [noise]\nClaims\nTake bakers quarterback stresses statues

we had we now have and those are some that you mentioned we now have companies that are big enough to really fit fit that role I don't know that it that they do no not yet but uh oh Amazon in particular is just getting\nEnormous and I'm In the book the for the hidden DNA of Amazon Apple Facebook and Google or the author talks about\nJust how massive Amazon is a for instance far fewer us households have a gun than Amazon Prime thirty percent of sixty four percent holding a more Americans have primed and voted in twenty sixteen only fifty five percent\nI'm more Americans have Amazon Prime then go to church\nA more have Amazon Prime than um than or in a monogamous relationship with a spouse\nWho should have said that about more Americans had NBC and CBS and ABC I mean maybe\nBut they're into so many other things to which you know you've got to consider\nThat I'm a ... that they're they're into\nEverything else like that I think it's fifty five percent of households now or

the Republicans do not gain ground and the Democrats do it shows some light at the end of the tunnel and shows what we may be headed for in the two thousand twenty presidential election and even though that would be two years away\nA seats gained in the house of representatives and possibly in the Senate could undo quite a few things that the president has already done\nAnyway the Washington Post ABC poll\nFinds fifty three percent of Americans support further investigation of Kavanaugh by Congress\nAnd the question here is what's going to do he has already been made a Supreme Court\nFor life so what does it really going to do\nI'm not saying you have to like it I'm not saying you have to hate but\nDo we really want to go ahead and do some more investigation when the FBI has given him

[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nOoh\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd I ended up killing one of these hey hey\nOr to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um reviews standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was fun we learned a lot of fun it was really fun I live in LA fun right hum that he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] the amount of that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we\nTook the criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work\nPeople criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge like a couple of\nThousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to address\nIt a secondly we decided that that\nUm we would use the highest\nRanks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one and then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure than\nUm [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong\nBut it's it's not what happened um\nAnd uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest 'cause I think we would have kept our promise but early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already so he's on the recording us for a year his\nName's Mike ... ... and since he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nOn my two collaborators worked also very very hard\nI'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell and the other day yeah ah so this was in in\nIn the men's amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard and we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and note that Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers and striking us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to\nThe author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement\nBe qualified for tenure um our paper spanned the ones we wrote spanned Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven\n[noise] and\nSo we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines that pay first got into we probably would have had more had we not been a short\nSo there's you know un who you are at twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good\nConfidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten cold\nCase so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA hand to\nHand article where they got a little gold

behind a the\nA papers a of record that were were\nBeing written a four four feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique to but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it does not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just say this is an act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to return how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and\nStudents are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the way in a very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the critical edge over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to sit in that without being comforted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and ask him and then not to be able to speak in class or to be broken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real\nIf this were published what what would that mean to the university system would would [noise] what's that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year so they decided it didn't come to us\nOut of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working and social justice side or the fields topics\nCourses I guess as the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nGreat I'm we're on the left needed a responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you know or left wing people who want the left\nTo come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't ... remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person we have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details and I really hope that you know that our project kind of reaches reaches that point does that make

pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about\nThe idea of people being elected right I might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this is an idea that uh and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean that's you know it'd be which it may not want that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight at least should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want why do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb\nDon't want to live under a farmer's some no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has\nTo do and how to live they don't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nWould not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's\nHeaded by the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the it out\nYou know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move\nYeah broadcasting from American standard bearer dot com studios playing Batman\nThere is a fascinating story about Michael who play um if you're a
