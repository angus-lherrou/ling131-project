recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's one difference\n... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and Kevin ... we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violent okay oh okay that really got both of those so the little do you remember where they happen or you know she does remember when they happen okay and so does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course well yeah well in their words\nCase they both have a note from there do they get around those cases are the the Ford case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which you refer to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling that would never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might know slight distinction\nBetween those two things one has notes or that do to do to actually named the accuser [laughter] and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is\nI'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting me yeah and so she and you know and in one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being for worship and have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has named several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening but people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have that I was not there some of them said I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key that once in a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax um writings um\nPictures and so are those are things that she showed two co workers in real\nTired real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that Ford told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually yeah advice you Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at\nThat time yeah but but but lives and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nWell what you got to your tape now we haven't seen

favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter swatter is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line\nAnd that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is that actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and the the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to implant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe ... he's a ... I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company to make money or they have a certain the east coast of certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about paying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shaped and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's continue tight this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how for instance you know there's there's\nUm a\n... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that right yeah\nIt's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\n... one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the result the people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it's secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nGoogle is a Google is a verb but now they are not a noun verb auto Google it yes well I think Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's a real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this so it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news this competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way have fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add\nThat the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you to vote in different ways that wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias\nYou know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why will you not I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good at it is not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line review line dot com Peter ... with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the plant forming\nA and kind of a

into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line\nThat's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah and I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first to consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet that shows you the ... the scope and the size that Google has wait a minute how it's it's the ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW\nYes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google products somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com\nBut his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product because if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert apps signed this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran uh did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out the same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech if you have on general or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when\nWhen you know what I use Gmail well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another\nFor their a I research so Google isn't fried rice for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of it look\nThere's that this is just at the beginning let me tell ya boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people it used to look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in

who claim that that these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that\nThere's some evidence that they do um you know and it but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true and a lot of cases [noise] um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this this is you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they've known in all this is like\nA lot of there's a leader in in in psychology yeah this I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy isn't it the real deal with\nSome real credibility I Can't come to terms that hard on the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to se discrepancy Hillary and voter right right um but beyond that uh seems incredibly hopeless\nTo me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people how to persuade people to look at the world and a slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a all long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talk about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to on my wine myself from Google I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm In I'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no

... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do is it's the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one it's because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know uh the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know as you get into deep south and ... but I don't even know how to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers or use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah\nWe talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go deaf duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using it and I went to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on prone\nSo now I've got ...
