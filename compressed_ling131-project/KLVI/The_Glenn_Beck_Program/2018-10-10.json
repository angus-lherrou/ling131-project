caller I'm about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight\nBack and we\nShould fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but we\nWere not at a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst ... steps are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage kind of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime you know rage an outrageous and headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think\nYou know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is dance response is I mean that just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of\nPeople feel like I Know you are there's a lot of built up\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in ...\nAnd he weighs tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution\nAround the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nBut he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and\nOur and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened we're going to go really a wry rarely\n... and I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there challenges but this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways\nA that Judeo Christian or a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe\nA better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables but\nHe also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around because the American woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know well don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said\nYou fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user titled were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they're the targets of the outrage and certainly\nIn creating photo and falls crises and outrage well\nHere's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically\nWere winning I mean look at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\nYou know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know are trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and
