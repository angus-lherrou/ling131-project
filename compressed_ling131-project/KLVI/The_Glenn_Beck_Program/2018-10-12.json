you left out some really big thing is could never have happened without the ... in support of the media yes\nI put the media here at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the size which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying\nThat we in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil and I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that I tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they sent they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nA because she was a victim of something\nAnd he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year [noise] All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters within a half an hour says that I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened to Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I I I didn't really made um I was in an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on I mean was

goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live okay fine um then

gets them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back the answer is no\nI don't and no one else does either this is a tremendous example\nOf political

cut ties with Fox and move on and go find another job this could just go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mine for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we didn't celebrate the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations his new start pending I drank on the way home [noise] we got the call ah we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang the

time if you don't want to talk about anything so [noise] um [noise] I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive why we're there indications\nOr was it just a bad feeling the feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and it's told to call your son right away without explaining why and I just had a hunch and sure enough the hunch turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with fat and all that wasn't the prescriptive antics he didn't know the past and was accidental overdose\n[noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I ... at that moment I had no fight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close and we spent the better part of the next year\nJust talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that it's an epidemic excuse me and a and\nA ... parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and not sure what you're taking the parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlanta to be exposed to potentially dying from an overdose\n\nIt's a very emotional and I think important um interview there\nThere are places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think tense\nUm and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody\nNo matter what side you're on the opioid thing I mean I I um I got an emotional whole yesterday from somebody on the TV show that said thank you\nThen to replace a path grey who is very hard to replace because he is not only funny and entertaining but he also has a great intellect and a truly\nUnderstands a our founding and the founding principles so we wanted somebody with some a real uh meat on the bones\nAnd a guy who I have really grown to love but he already had another job or is Steve days\nSteve works for see our TV uh but we have convinced the our TV too also kind of it's kind of like a Warner Brothers and ah you know the old the paramount studios deal where we're like okay well you can use\nOur star for this movie and we've convince them to ah let us use Steve\nTo uh do a program immediately after this and welcome to the program now Steve Day so are you\nI'm doing well get to see guys that were really really excited about this starts on Monday\nYeah starts on Monday he's still going to be on see our TV's still gonna be doing this E. R. T. V. thing but he's doing a two hours of for us everyday tell if anybody if they don't know who you are\nExplain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] that that are just moving in with pat when you say the second best one hears that have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number two\n[laughter] how moving the island and why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do\nYou know I we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\nBecause we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time because we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the fart factory uh of of ... the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbying verbal bombs that our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nOr you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I'm a doctor or a Denver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter um and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody who is\nWho's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress areas\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentlemen we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy and a liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe\nEven Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nIn any somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you a little league game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God says or immoral and dumb than us Eric Harris and likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are though outside outside of\nThe media Rena I agree that there are you know I see\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't\nTalk ... she has no interest into his ... he wants to end you want to share country with a ...\nIt's the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win mhm so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's a dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen chair pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nRoe v Wade happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid in the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people that they can't do for themselves you know and and and ... and has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has it gotten away everything funny things happened the last few years though guys she is bringing it up now to me\nAnd she's semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all or whether I Can't I Can't ...\nDo you watch them never and he was it was up when I'm On the year\n... India it unless it's ... hang on just a second I Want the audience to know\nThat's unheard of in our business ... that you could not have done this job agree without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... me too long for them it's just toxic ingestion in the ... yeah yeah my mom watches a lot more of this you actually like your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she\nCame to me one day before the twenty twelve election and she brought it up she started bringing politics that to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does that he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away wow okay yeah um and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine whites Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fine if we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not find with\n... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems um of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like we're not communists right and so we have\nWe have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communist they\nDon't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and capitalism\n... when you look at you know for the last
