anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you used on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about\nPolitics but at what\nPoint do you see good people say\nEnough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYet but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi in California how are you know

don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually\nHave persuasion as any goal the the only thing there\nIs just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch heads to a pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book that different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really\nBuilt for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of ... restored downtown and Omaha right\nNow and there's no end to fight here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that many ... basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content\nBut it was shared content ... there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics or you could still\nTalk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now and they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still\nReally only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media\nAs if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring them [noise]\nSo what is are are we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... a a pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all\nOf those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity\nThat way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness\nAlmost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work\nDo you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy\nAnd that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community and I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and what\nYou

happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal I'd hang of it before you're sure such that started with me I should go in the kitchen absolutely on them and talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because satellites testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIs an unfair way of rewarding schools\nAnd it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is another reason is there pressure to take tests or to feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy standardized testing is very good when you're in high school and showing what you should go or your liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do hear that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about you know you do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states some help on how to read write\nSurvive in the world without at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked at the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nLet me give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class control and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready to analyze testing you will lose about we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion not going to the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted Minnesotans were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only ones saying these things because I cross the entire state might say that the two counties across all ... to ... to ... by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than a traders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAt one uh ... told me said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\n... that's how bad it is for people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey can ... number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great hospital plumber and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and it for a new computer all day ... that a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think cause you write to me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who have felt that are not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory ... yes I Do um [noise] so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and gets into your degree why should they be boarding school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things no worries go to a two year trade school go to ... to become a plumber corporate or whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and you're doing it's a problem so do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn a work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people might you know if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss to show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lottery sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth grade I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use good luck\nHe was on his promise is going to happen\nA bunch of coup prep schools will pop up a bunch of great great schools will pop up\nGuess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars he going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans I mean this will pop up it'll be amazing\nThere is the best part when he schools pop up now we're spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand ... is more than four billion dollars\nWe've said all of the federal funds\nWe've removed tons of administrators\nWe've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core a we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids I think the court the unhappy kids now thinking about this lemon twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nSo we have to get over so if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably uh maybe tweet\nStorm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that was Tim Shell so this is a radio debate yet again and they're just deciding\nNo we don't want the dummy wrong there are three other people should be me should also be the Green Party and also the damn party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the worst part with all of this we're still growing and they're still going down\nThat's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship\nMhm or maybe they don't care if people want to donate how's he doing

state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for governor to impede business\nPeriod no ifs ands or buts if I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief\nI should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's oh he's not only\nDoing that she's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nAbsolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around it eat X right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants insurance forest firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more widely in the insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just say if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that

said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking district story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes oh the cops words that have been revamped of all because of that in other words but it now if you're a tire caught what you retire when you're a felon again\nI'm going back to the cop\nThis and this is where we are in New York state this

doing on that particular day but there's an interesting way of looking at this we talked to a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then changed to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that in people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if it's Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve\nAnd then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand sixteen so two thousand twelve on average ... according to five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats so what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now are we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in the states\nSo if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate into two dozen sixteen\nBut a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting now they were Twenty one districts that voted for Iraq Obama\nAnd then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one or so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bottom on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nOr in two thousand sixteen that's swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling is showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points that's big the big change so and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting and roam around ...\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for rock Obama\nWith Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these a district show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for all bronco Obama been changed to Trump in the Obama election that had about five points advantage for Obama and those states and the Trump election there was about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing a twelve point advantage for Democrats now now that part of that it it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just there's popular Democrats already Pennsylvania is a good example of that where they have been just a big lead or not because I don't think it's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers how to tell me what all this means\nFrom last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum started just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean right now it seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid and the Senate right now when will we see any movement at all of due to the shooting and the bombing\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably in your real polling reaction that lethal today so you'd have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday\nThe early okay I Will look for this\nElection by numbers\nOn the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend or as you know a gunman opened fire at

that says Vietnam veterans in his seventies and we went all the way we live in Ashland, Kentucky\nWe got up at two AM Joe six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday\nAnd and then stood for eleven hours straight because we we were told the first two thousand people in line with it\nThe hangar and we knew we were going to get that way and and as it got through security and looking at George saying oh I Can't wait to sit down and you get to the hangar there were no states so there's a reality of we're going to be standing another six hours on concrete\nSo what we're saying is this president is a lawyer [laughter] I'm Sorry I just play that just playing the ahead for a second [laughter] go ahead tell us or\nI could say it as much as they

garbage we you would never know when I was ten thousand people there you know one was complaining yeah I I\nI kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I tend to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down no people were so open about talking and\nYou know someone had to go to the bathroom and into their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child ... well you you run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment\nYou know it's like a president that's happened to show it was I and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois\nBecause I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt of whether the president was going to show up or not and
