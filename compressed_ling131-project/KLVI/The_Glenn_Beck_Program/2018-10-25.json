ca I think she was dropped by her talent agency she's a pariah now she's a pariah and\nPeople will say on the right good really good good people on the left will say good how Megan Kelly affected anyone's life\nWell she has made it very difficult for NBC to live\nDown their sexual harassment and assault that's been going around their offices she keeps bringing that up\nShe was very serious and one of the biggest critics of NBC and the way they handled\nSome of those allegations seemingly they are really finding a a quick way\nOr they seem to be to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those are things that she said\nWhich is kinda fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know\nThat they're going to do ... ... talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and and how how those conservatives are really about Roy Moore oh\nHe's a he's a bad guy or but we're going to find when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nThat NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all that goes on and making Kelly happens to me one of the biggest critics of what happened at NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone it's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can damn those remarks there is no place on our air\nOr in this work place for those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I added that quote it's very unfortunate and quote what is unfortunate is that America has devolved

it's a vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country\nAre cry babies they're sick of this\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics and the last place probably the last comes first\nAcademia [laughter]\nYou should be coddled\nThe slightest thing upsets you well that's not American\nIt's not we're the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains in in a um a in a ... a wagon train okay\nIs she was she looks like a million address with a bomb it okay she she'll\nShe also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\n[laughter] you know she did she wiped her face and ...\nAnd kept going she didn't wine she didn't cry about it she's like oh\nCrap [noise] shouldn't around with that I poked my eye out and she moved on that to Americans are yes bad things happen\nWe move on yes people say things that I Do like we move on that\nYes things have changed were evolving we're learning new things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\nMegan Kelly oughta know blackface is\nAwful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what if it's a costume that his purpose flea\nRidden a ridiculing race as black faces done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly ... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I the ah question it's not even she was advocates\nDating she was questioning why why is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people\nWhy is this wrong that person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong I think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know her whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me\nHow are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that\nWill know that she was innocent and this is so\nRidiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen\nEighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't thought of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe set to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter and here we are in reality let me read that one

know he was funny for Columbus is\nAt the time but he's not really funny enough to be a standup comedian as we as a side has basically stand up comedy show a Michael Moore and tropical ad which cannot twenty sixteen right during the weeks before the election he's hoping sway the election to Hillary\nWhen you when you say it when you say like we saw um I don't think you're yet you should be careful with the use of the week 'cause I don't think I don't think I could find two people maybe you and I don't know who else in his audience might have seen that\nYeah I think they're dressed like a

to movies I remember\nColumbine get a lot of young people in their twenties or real excited about that movie uh they've forgotten about it maybe they moved on to cheer and chemical and compare a Daily

not funny or that a is there anything to be said for uh the fact that ah this\nThis kind of stuff uh you know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not he's not the rebel anymore it's\nJust it's not you know he was revolutionary and we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy Pelosi saying all the same stuff that he was saying\nRight there is there a scarcity value to what he does anymore everyone's doing it uh there's a kind of a sad moment at the end of Sarah nine eleven nine where he does its Hitler montage instruments that Trump is like Hitler as like interest into playing the speech the Trump and Hillary and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler\nLast for about three years is like is the last one to this Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nI think the main thing observation objects where the culture has gone because we have at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even and we talked about what are Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that pause and they're not just talking about socially you know there's a there's a problem in America where we\nLook at Canada and say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left\nPointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism I mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know where socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an\nEnd to capitalism and they're still getting elected\nRather than in the leader of that parade for a while but now he's kind of ... and ... it's ... it's kind of got ahead because this movie um capitalism a love story with the communist uh at them but you see the Soviet Nashville had some ... and that kind of thing is is not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far less\nSo what does that say to you does that say does this say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think a Democratic Party is not doing themselves in his favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at that time\nWas seemed like Gehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should dared to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff that should really stay out of this open borders stuff\nThey should stay away from a abolish ice they should stay away from Medicare for all of all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the

election is about the caravan this election is about um ah shutting people up\nThis election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that's what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog whistles set for if if you think that the caravan is not something you should worry about\nWhat's wrong with you\nIf you're not worried
