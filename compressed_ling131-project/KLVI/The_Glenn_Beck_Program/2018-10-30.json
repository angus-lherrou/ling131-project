Hannity right here alcohol well have a great day [noise]\nWhether in sports for a selfie sections aren't harmed in on the air news are five sixty Kaomi I hold my head I hardly you'll see\nLook at look at the look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist\nNow when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite that's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\nI did I did and they basically taken the position that\nAnybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is\nIs a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so at my wife is Mexican she's a first generation or you know a ... a Mexican American ... it's ... they use\nThis identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and they just hack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late last waning\nAnd you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided only tell one side of the story\nSo you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use\nStorytelling as a as a way to do that so that's what I ... it was it was astonishing\nKind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on is purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that the what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear\nHollywood is such a small community and it's run by so few people and it was just such a fear for losing work and one way and ... and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where\nThey're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of their conservative um and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets a stink about among conservative that they're conservative\nThey run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very uh unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they started you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years\nStart to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know uh and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking this any more you see the ratings start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new frontier for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red tailed America that's on the heart radio a pod cast or cheating on her radio excuse me I hunt radio ...\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you I'm Patrick I'm I have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly inside\nWhile she's a great gift she's she's very credible she's ready to interview you know we\nHave our own kind of sixty minutes kind of person I'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized\nThat the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and the and the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um it it it basically she was you know print brave and doing that um I think you know from a career wise it might've been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment and exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a\nGod given birth to a man I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of her because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened in the egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red build America you can hear it on the ah I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues and I want to kind of go through a a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing chef Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion\nWhat what are your thoughts on the care of them [noise]\nYou know I think that it is something that [noise] for whatever reason the last ten years the left\nIs completely changed their tune on 'em in regards to our borders and are open borders I I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nOf that's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do\nAnd we follow a to construction workers that um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs to to a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and I think that we're seeing this here I think that this caravan it is just not for political refugee status these people are looking for its economic\nAnd it's going to hurt the the most vulnerable people in the United states\nWell I think it's what's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\n[noise] you know that's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent fuel out of that because a lot of these kinds of labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the the homeless crisis in ... in Los Angeles\nIs is that there is is the drug epidemic there are there's a thing called patient and we actually have a story coming out on that\nI'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare to fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers and then when they end up using men are using the the health insurance or they ended up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge\nSurge of of ... basically go to rehab tourism here in the in the Southern California area that\nHas been a that is it being attributed to the homeless ... of course last you know basically follows\nThe the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents that have basically been through this and they went directly to Obamacare as being part of the reason why uh their kids have gotten out here in Los Angeles and then get end up getting stuck out here\n[noise] um you're covering also one other story I went to a cover with you why does the black community vote almost unanimously for Democrats\n[noise] you know we are that's where we're releasing two episodes on Thursday so um our
