[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nThat that's that's a terrible direction to go and lead you don't awful roads where you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly judge correctly\nYeah and it's it's gonna be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up\nOr his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago\nAnd yet uh\nI just saw an article today above from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ...\nAre just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ... and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election that Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't care ... occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know the debate still hate Clarence Thomas and the lowest paid per capita but I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning\nThe Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court would that was one hundred percent of of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which\nYou could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [noise] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um but\nThe other people and Cory Booker do not care won't for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus or and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate and the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um\nAnd it and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually has evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to\nA the police and and again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but what you're judging by the standards that they're putting up it's totally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... that story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people\nSay that they remember this this incident uh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what happened what mine of it it happened ... none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if\nLet's say one of the witnesses she named instead came out and yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident but just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of slate talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked\nBroderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it she eventually told the FBI the truth uh Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son\nA lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against her five people said ... five people say Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party and the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nOr a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick where they bloodied lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Campbell and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of corporate like by the way I'm going to renovate that was another ... ...\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window\nWow that is a\nThousand times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh and yet that was ignored\nFor ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now\nAfter they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump and that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes wrong it still makes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including cooperating witnesses of what happened there it it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that that the media actually\nThinks we should take their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system\nWith actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that is the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're now supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that isn't sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two when she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there was some ... can show evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated\nOr exception of Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy their so pissed off about that and they do not want I'm running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are they are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the [noise] I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other day I took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate

daily and today's was about ... and whether Lucy\nCase should be allowed back on stage ever ever um you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes at odd\nPart of this saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him doing something that against it as well right like he would ask they say yes\nOr or um there was one case where\nUm he\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation here he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics power dynamic absolutely yeah the power to makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian\nHe's in ... he wields incredible power in this country now mind credit eleven ever fired at any job in the nation at any job you're\nA sarcasm is just reality in the situation that they're kind of comical way better than what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was\nWho was this was his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it in force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation last alert to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I I have issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no that was shown what she answered\nA diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ... he admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of ah making people he admitted to these things and he did admit to\nI I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think that\nThat would I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like so I was wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no\nAnd and they and the idea that you\nKnow Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian can affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again he's making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scare away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians

like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks into does affect or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose the gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he espoused raunchy several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times or the exhaustive report about tried to talk to the club owner about why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision listen\nAll the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian

party like\nWhat are we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh dislike for the party of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is Marcia women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's got some bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of saying about it yeah I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that this uh this has occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicates that you know the event occurred I Would I ever called the victim I called them survivor but when I when they leave I\nEver survived this assault by this man if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] I guess we could all colors they'll survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence why she make\nIt up why would she lie about it\nThat's a good question because I Love this one ... possibly can lawyer motivation [laughter]\nNot that accurate should like this I don't know when I saw the gal we\nTalk about uh yeah I Know we talk about the the ... women's right to choose it is just ended as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one I\nWouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they ... they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we've seen foreign crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five\nAccusers accused of high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through\nAll the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why\nPeople are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time\nAnd the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing the swastikas on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they can do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them\nWe know the the fourth accuser didn't even bother to write any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser when some Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats\nWere the first two ... and in the second one is the is that there's a ... their right they went they the person who made the allegation\nSaid I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember to even happen exactly\nThe same old act on Sunday or operating evidence on that one either and there was and look the Ford won was only I think taken more seriously than the others because there was it an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if there was no evidence proving that had happened here um and then of course obviously people like have it on his uh his or what this is worth saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went and just you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible job it recounting what she believed the story was\nWho knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it because I mean but as we heard\nWith Hillary Clinton she said there were they vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this\nThe media access if this is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter] I Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases in probably in all of them\nAnd ... you brought up the high school situation in California where they called the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault or and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk\nI don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him they didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student\nWho ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her elegy peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a she you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you F ing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and\nCould say or do you ever change that\nBy the way the ... of course admitted to sending the threats to herself ... or or the woman and why would you do that yeah why what could her motivation possibly be it's hard to do in this case it's not hard to detect with Brett Kavanaugh\nOr a the a woman in Texas who said a state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the camera footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing this case we didn't know about this at the time or the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping a ... a people and that was ...\nTo school and none of that\nVery bizarre\nIs on news talk five sixty K O v I\nOnly in ... the president hears first hand from his secretary of state and the probe into the missing journalist presumed murdered during a visit to the county constantly in Turkey might\nPay back from meeting with the Saudi ruler they\nMade clear to me that they understand the
