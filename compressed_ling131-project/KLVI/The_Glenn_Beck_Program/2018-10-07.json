about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are treated in this country\nAt the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence for any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story that is the story and I for one I for one\nWe'll not condemn Ford and I will not condemn a a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to

talking about something entirely different why\nWe should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true\nIn the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question\nIs this worth saving\nNobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking the question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both but is it on the on the whole\nHas it helped more people or hurt more people\nWere not having that conversation we are having now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good doing month how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not to talk about\nWhat capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\nNo I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we are talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show and and you you're talking about\nThis big war this big cultural battle that we're having in most countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about the Trump Administration or about capitalism in general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nA mute on humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are\nOh unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean if you're going to ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night it was going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take after prison God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I ... you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of\nFreedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense yeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise]\nMy my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in most and I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believe [laughter] and and the their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world\nWhat really matters is what works what system works full you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system pulled people up to billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your\nYou know absolutely so some Nineteen Seventy until today you know when when you when I were\nReally little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on so it's really in the seventies when people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children and it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been ever advocate no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nBut front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is it two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation or poverty Glenn since you and our kids\nAnd there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it\nAs Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are willing ... are wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are yeah slow and it's got up to now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington DC and in every state Capitol around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people [laughter] so so competition is good competition politics and economics and in the competition of ideas the fact is that you know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a friend democratic nation is very are important\nAnybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people\nPeople that are at the bottom non so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like stretching out potatoes\nSome ways they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system that make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies [laughter] you know if you went to university so your four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying\nYou got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience and so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't try is today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd why can't they rise that can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems are parents who don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers [laughter] we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen ... until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kid should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills and put holiday should have without going to college\nAmazing or there but it's it's that early I think of apprenticeships that I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens times since we've seen it it's amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies back with more Arthur Brooks and is America worth saving that Mm\nOn news talk ... on me I depend on us\nBut ... says fine line features from your businesses here in South east Texas like world gym the business

her okay back with\nUh Arthur C Brooks he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute\nArthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good none of this is good\nUm however ... we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry because we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is is got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nNo it isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill arise in the constitution guys like Glenn Beck and when you've got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and throwing good\nThe big problem is that there are too many people in media and politics and entertainment and on college campuses on the right and the left from Georgia dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically that's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we were just really have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate him and there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talk about\nThe things that really bring us together and then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich by by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time they're waiting not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive into say their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people\nIs to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right and get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship ... lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is unequal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nYeah so I just have this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAs leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program or you have to have you on more often you are\nA well spoken well thought out full
