offer only for a new car members limitations apply\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines and all that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working uh you know even even when I listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of already an adult when people are you yeah\nOf course but when people are using it turns out my research shows other research shows when people are using something like\nA Google Search engine they turn off the biased detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOr one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people [noise] uh I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the um creepy line I'm about how\nGoogle has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then uh how they have ... you know\nThat when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where you you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and\nYou got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect have absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were saying biased or in a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias so you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you\nUh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there in two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability\nTo shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide\nIt's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use ah ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results I felt like a news story that just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays or in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is the system\nThat they would have dreamt of for propaganda\n[noise] oh\nAnd this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called\nCan of ways big tech can shift millions of both in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways\nAre that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm sending seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh\nAnd they they they're I mean some of these effects that ... that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences and they're ... or ... years and there is no\nDoubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand and sixteen early to sound the sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using the Google\nBang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention a in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's\nThat's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh you know ... we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nA that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\n... but I Am I travel [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news\nSingle thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in\nThe yeah well sure but you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and their products are so good so but you don't realize that these aren't real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform [noise]\nUh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is that film that you mentioned the creepy lie as a when ... when\nYou had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peters flights are on your show recently of is a uh he's the one who would who really got that film running a\nIt sure wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I ... for for rental or sale and it's it yeah and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just goes to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this\n... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\nWell when I when my research a first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any\nGoogle products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so I have these amazing screen shots that they're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah I have to screen shot showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay um let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last\nSeven ten ten of these that\nYou're following can altogether okay\nOut and all the other okay so let's take on one real quick begin\nVery good when ... okay here we go this is called the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWill buy one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay\nWe're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have\nTime he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the ... the line it's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com\nHe was on used on mine sixty Kaomi I\nThe argument\nNews I'm Kathleen Maloney

M. E. we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect is really scary ah this this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to\nBut if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November\nTwo thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker bird\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out go out and vote reminders\nUh mainly to supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that was even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others but if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day and additional or hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I don't I\nI don't think he did that because you know he was very over confident or you know as as were Democrats\nUh I'm not a Democrat I'm not I'm I'm a moderate in and independent but the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shift votes and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't that what\nTargeted advertising is all about but you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive ...\n[laughter] I mean this is so dangerous um and it is I mean it's everything that aside fi you know a writer has envision forever\nOr and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] [noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally\nYeah yeah yeah\nOh no you're you're absolutely right they have literally unprecedented power or two is shifts people yes shift unstable people's shift anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power\nOr one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their eight minute film called the selfish ledger you wanna get creamed out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape human kind\nHard you know I Know lots of people working on alternative kinds of you know and services and\nA and a lot of people are talking about block chain and so on but I mean the reality is you know we're talking about Ninety percent of search around the world is done on Google\nUh these two companies are serving right now more than two point five billion people that'll be pass four billion within the next three years they're just growing and growing\nAnd found so it's ... ... what they're doing in China\nI mean I mean I don't know how I don't know how they sleep at night\n[noise] [noise] well that's outrageous that is ... because they're actually they're actually partnering with the Chinese government to participate in the Chinese governments are aggressive\nA program to control all of its citizens and Google is purchase a painting and that I mean literally making it easier and better\nMaking that kind of system easier and better that's ... that's s outrageous\nDoctor I Would I Would love to uh fly you in and spend a couple of hours with you and and have you on regularly to to be able to monitor and help in any way that we can to get the word out this is\nThis is the thing that I think America and the world should be concentrating on and no one's talking about the world is being redesigned by a handful and we're just not aware of it and it's going to change overnight\nA doctor thank you so much I really appreciate it absolutely\nYou bet it's been an honor ... thank you very much Dr Robert\n...
