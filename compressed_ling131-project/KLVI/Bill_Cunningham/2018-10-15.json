Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party\nWhen the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... ... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools\nFor generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro after policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled the black families by and bracing welfare writes the penalized married couples who get married\nIt goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all said and the sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous cuddly and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had caused some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south had their control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats\nCodify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control way of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter\nOf black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's gonna try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese are rise to any black who steps out of line\nThey're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're\nCalled uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks we'll\nDiscover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee\nThe schools are completely dysfunctional that black families completely broken there's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support for a different political outlook\nHe has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book because it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in line they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm\nCan you think of worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and\nPoverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nFor mornings with Joe and Mika to

from American standard nerd dot com studios\nOkay here's the deal Monday Night I got a call from the White House president would like to see you friday night what is in Cincinnati I said of course\nI wanted to go watch a high school football game with a relative playing but I thought well this is pretty important\nSo on Wednesday I made a request to the White House to do a short interview which of the White House should said should be kept her about five minutes if it's granted I said okay actually turned out to be almost Fifteen minutes because the president and I had so much fun so I met the president in a hanger on friday evening\nAbout an hour later he was going to go speak in a north of Cincinnati about thirty miles north of Cincinnati and Warren County and I are at a Republican gathering um which twenty thousand people show up in little worn county while\nStanding in a field with a light rain and cold dark and the sun was down it must have been forty forty five degrees the president let 'em up\nSo well on friday night the White House said no problem I met with the president did like a Thirteen fourteen minutes interview and the references to about an hour from our relate to the what\nWas going on in orange county and then yesterday Saturday he was in Kentucky\nAnd uh and beautiful and I think he's he told me off the off the air is going to be doing this three or four nights and the next three weeks and he said I got more energy about this than I've ever had so here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tater headed\nFirst of all Mr President welcome to Cincinnati thank you you have a long distance relationship here I Do I have had ... ships\nI had swift in with my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up [noise] we uh eleven hundred and sixty four you underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick if I ... that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there are no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage day everything's on what's going to happen with the making of housing development oh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I as we got back many people actually if you look at it it's like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll be in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure it was very happy right now\nAbout your wife got you have to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney\nIn Africa well she's a terrific first lady in a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very set in and out of the kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just it's on the human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in in South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just extra car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were sick and so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that\nWe're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and we have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous as much a much improved approved deals you know improved\nI Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico are we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to us if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nAcross the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and most convenience sake what great surface and warranties and you can get on line

five sixty kill we are\nThey compare that with what Leslie stall did his job and Leslie solved it on the president\nTonight and it's amazing plus the interview with a millennia Trump on friday night and I thought was ridiculous about our hats and or a jacket that she wore in a fashion statement she was making it's just ridiculous how the media coverage that you know media Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage\nOf Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I I don't recall with all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped in the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's groupthink because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction we're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right\nThirty two states are controlled by governor a Republican governors house the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing conservative\nWhat CBS what's safe from top to bottom we're going to resolve well we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively I think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News\nAnd the ABC NBC and CNN would take an alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often with shepherd Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conduct it was\nA regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC those ratings would double and triple and it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're\nGoing to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that\nAll you gotta do is look at Newsmax TV or a one American network and you'll find conservative values in the news\nReflects the American people so let's continue with calls from California Texas North Carolina Louisiana and Ohio\nHave aligned becomes available number to call his

do something about it\nHow about the media demanding that Rahm Emanuel do something about seven hundred black Americans killed this year in Chicago wouldn't it be great if CNN one after Romney manual they way they go after Donald J drop would that be great\nPlus I Want to get your reaction to the extent of the interview I had with him as opposed to a Leslie stall who kept interrupting the poor guy constantly never got a thought in edgewise so let's get\nA reaction and more but tonight the special nice as always great to have on the president for some of them all with you as president I met him

included into\nThe weeds on it because I don't know what happened you know I don't know what happened and I have been criticized for it and I I didn't make any pronouncements about guilt or innocence but the undeniable fact is that it was acceptable\nIn many American Airlines to kill this guy Kavanaugh to destroy him know\nAnd that's what you saw in Germany now it's not the same thing obviously you know\nAll right and and you know when I make these points to the media matters and these are the propaganda outfits which would have been great on the jurors Joseph ... okay they are I call them and not say I know I'm not but your question was a good one how could it happen that ordinary Germans and in the United states German Americans are the largest\nEthnicity okay how can that happen that these people would do with these high and these things because it was acceptable thing I find it amazing and that's what we're seeing in America now we're seeing a rise horrible behavior that is acceptable\nWell there was a Minnesota schoolteacher and moan Monday or Tuesday that put out a tweet about someone needs to someone needs to kill ...

Trump\nSituation uh once he was elected all the rooms in the media changed says you know ... All right no longer was the truth and poor did was get him\nBecause we don't like him so all of our resources are going to be directed to getting him well the progressive movement is capitalized on that has exploited that and has walked into precincts where they got me yeah\nThe same people that accused me accused Kavanaugh impacts sure right same crew\nBut no Americans are they don't know what's happening or if they do they're looking away the Kobe or lose one view or no because of that now I don't think so no\nAnd something happening now you know you have to show his show I guess is in Saudi Arabia and dissident who uh has said nasty things in ... is a contributor to the Washington Post but a ... is a Saudi Arabian citizen seemingly he is killed in Turkey which shouldn't happen\nAnd but the media the last couple of three days has been all over Trump because they want Trump to do something about an individual murder of a Saudi Arabian citizen that happened in Turkey as Trump's responsible I ...

even take the ... not even close so that's\nEvil in a in a country that depends on an electorate being informed with accurate information again uh you know I I wrote a killing the ss\nTo highlight the fact that this can happen here\nYou know one of the first things that Hitler did was he eliminated the free press yeah All right uh his goons are in a intimidated them and if they didn't play ball they wound up\nIn a concentration camp [noise] so yeah we have a free press here but we don't have an honest press anymore\nYou know bill I said do a national correspondent on a week ago if you would take NBC CBS and ABC throwing CNN if say CBS\nWould make a conscious decision to objectively and in a conservative way report the news and stand out um between ABC and NBC\nI think there's great success for one of the national networks to change the course they're on quit doing Ninety four percent of negative stories about Trump to be more objective and coverage about what's going on wouldn't it make economic sense for CBS or NBC they won't do it but it ABC to make a conscious decision\nTo be objective and the cover news in a way that it's fifty fifty and balance why don't want to know why why didn't want him do it for economic reasons\nBecause the culture of the people who run those organizations right up to the top is liberal oh no question though Bob ... running Disney um uh the guys in Philadelphia and Comcast\n[noise] um the CBS people ah they're all foreigners and if they didn't tell all of that line their social\nLives will change or they wouldn't be look if you're a Robert

queen city I Love the queen\nSending us to talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back just religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is and he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I yeah we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just eat literally just took

what was the goal and what was accomplished with ... in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad and beautiful in one way and very sad and and the kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed is not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such a human basis they needed and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deals probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy banks and everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out [noise]\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal will make and I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so we're\nTalking about how many jobs you're talking to my retirement Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs which don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal of they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least is fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states so it was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries\nThey have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "15"}
