are Jewish\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with was he\nA friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump has a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history they're Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jew the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions\nSays I have and so this guy who ah hates\nJews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet\nPresidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing\nOf two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself\nPresident Trump with Russian help it it's unbelievable on that day\nAnd in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare Shirley Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know the media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses cessation of Republican members of Congress resulting in a mortar wounds to Stephen skill lease\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio over the last several weeks much like the uh the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples of left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder\nTo many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there's a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois\nThey blame conservative right wing talk radio of course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was\nHaving dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street or their diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio and his wife who's in the cabinet and\nThe media doesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist covered the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nSo I'm On the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion it's Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam bigot the anti Semite set a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered coding juice termites\nThe president said there's good people on both sides you know what he was referring to he was not referring to the tiki carrying torches by the white nationalist and the races marching around shouting racial slurs about Jews or by the way the president's grandchildren are Jewish he\nWas talking about those who want to keep Confederate monuments\nThose who want to keep Confederate ... mind you must be said those good people on that side\nAnd there's good people on the side more protesting that think the Confederate monuments out to be taken down but because that charges not explosive enough the left in the media keeps saying that the president said there's good people on both sides he was not referring to the white nationalist\nHe was referring to those who wanted to keep Confederate monuments now from bill counting EMS perspective I\nI don't like the idea of Confederate monuments cause they declared war on my country the United states of America and killed something in the range of six hundred thousand Americans by the way those Confederate who did that role Democrats\nThey you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight\nWhen the president said there's good people on both sides the one thought he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nOn the other side where those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist caring tiki torches shouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches\nThere's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's continue to get

going [noise] really\nYou know I could make yourself not but they have to go [noise] [noise]\nWell I don't know I just I just Google this December Thirteen Nineteen Ninety five the Reverend Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion martyrs they're white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre\nNewly revealed tapes show Sharpton there's not named Fridays but mentions the least disputing calls out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton and started the massacre at Fridays furniture Mart because a Jewish a small business owner\nMoved into the black community and so I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on its people for this crap\nAnd you know the other thing is that guy right to the White House and it was right and he actually got the cats are being made right\nAnd and Mrs you're calling from Utah and this was the guy who's now when they're an indictment now this was in a large media stories that fair to say in other words maybe\nEven a story and second page\n[laughter] and and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of a story it All right but I don't know just being concoction would've actually cause any damage but it ... it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get white powder all over your hands impose on your lap believe me and it's a fearful tear filled event and this was a regular event that the left does do Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nEver make rice and care for being real\nOften I'm a well can you imagine a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up but you can bring up anything you know you're kind of say a word\nWell Time Warner did this the Trump well what if the parent company of Fox ah sponsored a play in Central Park\nThat depicted the murder through repeated stepping up Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the me I'm number number one Fox's parent company never do it but Time Warner\nSponsored a play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar with a character looking like Trump being chopped the death toll on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night\nNow what did the same thing that happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nAdded a Canadian who Rocco bomb and held his head on stage\nBut Cathy Griffin now is touring the country to slow down audiences explained to me Rob why the media doesn't respond to these obvious\nDiscrepancies and disparities between the way they treat

earth Jews have done magnificently here because of family and faith and academics and hard work the Israeli ambassador to America said that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to be in anywhere in the world\nAnd so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter and no matter what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media the press CNN and their allies always lecture Trump Republicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric and our violence but when progressive explode which happens on a regular basis like\nStabbing Republicans setting Dutch trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins or the children are the president whenever that goes on\nAt no point or progressive ever lectured by the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism even when the president\nIs the only one in American history to have Jewish grandchildren and even though the murder in Pittsburgh had postings saying how much he hated Trump\nBecause Trump at Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump\nNever mentioning the hatred the radicalism of the left which exceeds what happens on the right the whole first in Baltimore oh the race writes the shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left never any connections river made\nBetween the cop killers in Dallas\nDuring a rally a black lives matter\nAnd then meeting in the White House\nWith those same leadership a black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama and the media never said wait a minute Mr Mr President how do you meet with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops\nWhat are we went dead cops when you want them now pegs in a blanket from like bacon\nNever a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence

recognize what happens to the last two years the Trump presidents in fact a couple of months ago a Jonathan Turley who's a pretty good guy law professor from George Washington said the first two years of the Trump Administration will be the peaceful two years\nNow and he said the last two years are going to be a disaster\nLet's continue now with ah Joel in Virginia Joel in Virginia Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joel how are you\nCould even bill cranky for taking my call but it's what I have for you I have some friends that called me earlier today\nFrom Korea and they're talking about and that's to kill them I was running as the Democratic candidate for governor you know that what they're telling me is that they've been running a lot of commercials on the state of Florida and which to have and also they have been having rallies and which both Al Sharpton who you spoke of earlier\nAs fellows are a lot of 'em are Maxine Waters and others\nHave been in the state of Florida campaigning and uh they have been coming up in reference to other than a federal indictment that bombing this to kill them every time that comes up he keeps coming up with the race card I'm Wondering what your thoughts are in reference to the Florida writes\nAndrew Gillum as a socialist his background is similar to the Democratic candidates in Arizona Andrew Gillum believes in the most left wing radical viewpoint of the police department Andrew Gillum is set in the past the guy who would be the governor of Florida\nThat the police departments are like occupying forces that began as slaves catchers\nIt's the most radical governor Florida whatever have now they're saying this is not the most the\nMost exciting character I Know but at least is not Andrew Gillum ... at least she wouldn't go to the same route of the Bernie Sanders Maxine Waters type and he would take over for the government\nAnd cash strike the police departments you of numerous police departments and Florida that have said they cannot support this guy because of his beliefs about\nThe police you can't support him if he Andrew Gillum wins in Florida I I Would be shocked\nBy the people that are called me at a ticket ... that's when it for\nThe people living off the air and move out of their fate because for telling me\nTo quit in a state income tax and counterattack talking income tax at all or wherever taxes that it may be ... probably be doubled according to what they're saying and apparently that's also come out in his literature so it looks like he does come in this kind of\nMassive exodus state of Florida\nYou know Joel I'm a great supporter of police in whenever a cop has killed I always mention their names there are many cop killers are who have not been identified yet and cops are dead when you have\n... the chief executive officer of the great state of Florida\nWho is made numerous remarks about cops being similar to slave catchers that cops are occupying forces you can't have someone like that in charge of police departments he's the chief executive officer of the great it's great state of Florida and honesty you can't have it so let's take a short break\nWhen we continue or we'll

continue the tragedies the tragedies is weak and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas rescuing former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempt to mass murder\nOr whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this uh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that uh this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the NBC News this morning head on a neighbor lived next door to them a\nHeavy set a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas Russian former NYPD officer investigator\nDetective and Thomas Redskin welcome again to the bill Cunningham shown Thomas how're you\nGoing to be very tough situation awful um\nBut when I watch some of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all and they had menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy\nAnd he said oh goodbye no difficulties he had posted online for quite a while and I ... and rabies including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish\nAnd why he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless uh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's response of all the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting\nSaying that uh that uh in fact the Sarah Sanders put out something a\nFew hours ago just said is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit do attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective ... said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nIt not as of yet when I've seen\nYou know there's always twenty twenty especially in the long course men or the investigative world when I Can't believe [laughter] no one else was monitoring his social media and there's other things that he was hosting couldn't have alerted only\nWhat the what we always say is your mom think say something [laughter] you know someone had this seemed I could've alerted the police the police we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about\nAnd do something or or look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him we can criticized the police but until that time police and law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was one in her call FBI numerous people had called about an Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nThere's no perfection on horse but you're only as good as shifts today and wish I could go on for spring is very easy to do after the same law enforcement is tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD\nWe always look back we oh we used to it at a review of what had happened and what we could do but at the same way that they're doing with the case in the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back then figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm short in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing toward say oc and ours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media\nSomebody knew or should have known this guy was does integrating ... and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours waiting for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate\nBefore social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people of like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews\nAnd against African Americans over several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you went and anyway Peter you go right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nYes I totally agree and take what you said even further this president has a son in law who is the orthodox and a very religious Jewish guy he has a daughter who converted to Judaism and as you said his grandchildren or Jewish\nSo you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what is said it's a matter of how we're saying and it's a matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments to there and agree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... a guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater\nIn New York City on may fit a bunch of years ago and thank God he had failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but they're on knots like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talking to someone the guy who is sort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns\nAnd go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas raskin former NPD NYPD officer thanks for coming in the bill ... show and all of us need to lower the rhetoric just a little bit because there's nuts

doing\nDoing great my friend about you\nGo let me share with the American people something you ever put forth in one of your mission UBS and that is what's going on and with all this stuff going on with the mailing in the bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some sense closer to Fifteen thousand at this point of Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organize stunt\nBy political agitator as an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add\nTo the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened\nWith the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media will deal with\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt\nA you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress a who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states who has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people\nSome of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a\nGang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they tried to sell this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their\nMeals are suddenly appearing tents are suddenly appearing medical care is certainly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nFree hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election in your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone at the Democratic party explained why here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on its belly along with water intensive medical care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will uncover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate\nUh caravans that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then they you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think you know how the Mariel boatlift\nAnd not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably to Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nIs embarrassing him because on balance", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "29"}
