scared to death their own shadow not one Republican mail center white male center was willing to interview a woman for the thought they'd be called sexist racist than thousand other words\nBy liberal they gave it to a woman a woman prosecutor named Mitchell who is the single worst prosecutor I haven't seen in my entire like near you and I could have put this girl on the stand and you and I would've destroyed or bill we would have had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case we've been ripped to shreds\nAbout five minutes and she couldn't get a decent question

who paid for your lie detector tests and I don't know what do you mean you don't know where's the follow up question everyone knows who pays ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous\nThey could've after about a thousand issues like in two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named three potential people would be the Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh and isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve\nTo ... heads the newspapers all over the country that said roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice and they replaced\nGinsburg faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney's Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by making up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father is CIA\nIs it true your grandfather was CIA [laughter] is it true your brother was working for a law firm that found a GPS fusion\nIs that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow bad is it true that Brett Kavanaugh was mother a Maryland said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure of your parents who do you call\nIt kept me on that one 'cause they claim he was never quite for closed down and they got the house

eventually they took him to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the end kind of rules for them\nIt doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is now going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand things you could say the CIA one it's amazing that's not a conspiracy theory her dad CIA at her grandfather CIA and her brother is with a company with a law firm founded\nFusion GPS on all things considered\nThis another deep state fraud conspiracy there's no other way

good to get a female perspective to the men and women are equal but somehow were different\nAll they're making more than I generally think pretty much the same of Reagan babe dot com also great radio talk shows than Las Vegas Nevada and Meghan bars welcome again to the bill Cunningham show Megan how are you\nA great that we do\nGo I Want to get a woman's perspective I ... I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after ah a doctor forwarded testified\nThe the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace did\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about the assault on the impact it at our life and not have your ... or this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally are respected I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist said forward as the credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and they're still in as the Democrats show toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman who's credible\nWho providers witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have a Christine Ford straight up line about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere\nBut every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who once anonymity to testify\nTurn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all so every time I tried to test her credibility Megan bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking\nSo when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\nBy the way up to Colorado yeah completely lost our way because he wasn't telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and men I found ... cabinets people even though there was such a notion from falsely accused innocent man who end up in a court of public opinion and they are they leading up to this\nQuote unquote hearing or his life was completely turned upside down his wife was getting death threats and ah his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed\nAs well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her or she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she has set herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to climb doorbell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she has issues\nNow it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or that it just because she says Brett Kavanaugh raped or maybe not but all the evidence that she for that so far fall short of being additives\nIn fact if you presented us in a court of law in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith Leyland Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did in ... her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I'd believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know I don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well\nI I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president's being twenty sixteen but the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running that didn't happen though November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about bread Kevin are getting the Supreme Court what his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Wallace Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because\n... ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility to in order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had a beat the post let me tell you it's not\nI wasn't given wires from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about equal right on gender equality what are you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad at eight percent and bringing bringing forward charges against another person so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly than we find out she was all over the world\nAh and also just the holes in her story said thank thank God for Kaine people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh and thank God for Lindsey Graham because", "year": "2018",
