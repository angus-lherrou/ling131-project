Ramirez shaking his junk and her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael ... boy he did a great job\nFor the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact a cast light away from a weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... put it on sweat Nick nobody believed in fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular\nOf the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple of girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape\nThis outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote so said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love\nSusan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it plus uh\nAs far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some wherever experts and independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a site this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin Oh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kevin O's line and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice\nAs a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse but also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter my sympathy with the with the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory counts and Van Dyke Perry\nWho spent a combined thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty or not\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out\nWhy can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate in other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker Kamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii\nWhen asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd show you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show has a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening aerial doom is\nAerial doom is as a writer on Stephen coal bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we've ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life unquote you see this was never about\nFinding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak\nBy a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that you wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe\nIt is unbelievable ... and this writer for the CBS Evening show Stephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin him for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized the vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight\nDidn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is a hero Mitch McConnell is a hero unbelievable the losers\nThe mainstream media pedaling in lives in irrelevant sees Senate Democrats demon crashes demon rats as some of them call them the Senate demon rats\nAnd Michael ... who's a loser in a sense but I Want that got to continue appearing with Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon every night you can put 'em on keep doing he's doing a great job\nSo let's continue with more of your calls at eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up later is that same Julie gun lock the independent women's forum talking from a woman's mothers

hurricane my Monday Night or Tuesday local police and the NTSB now investigating the deaths of twenty people after a crash involving a limousine and the town of ... hiring New York Saturday afternoon\nLimousine drove down the hill on route thirty through the intersection into the parking lot of the apple barrel country store the limo struck a two thousand Fifteen Toyota Highlander in the lot hitting to pedestrians killing them the limo then crashed into an embankment\nBoxes buying in is that limo heading to a birthday party when the crash occurred this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise] no one\nA new start five sixty kill me ah broadcasting from American standard they're not ... studios in standing\nTo rely on Susan Collins\nAnd Lindsey Graham to be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night\nShe was brilliant going over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees and the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of a Brett Kavanaugh as his wife his mom and dad as girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl of some sexual assault\nThan most likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid\nThe woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for re election in two years\nBut she ought to but now a clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork to like Valerie Jarrett ... fame to run against or in Maine have added\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis\nIn Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party could have pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but uh over the years\nOr one of the largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they're really cared about when the why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky for Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they did have one criminal prosecution against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this you know bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars to the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women than their leader would not be\nThe U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota if they really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenty sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to women these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten is correct\nBut every now and then you have the Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UVA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about that second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turn out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truth little thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always gonna be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys\nAnd her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh\nIt's because he was one boy\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore it moved to Connecticut so she had to tell the Feb that it was Kevin all but they but the notes of the therapists clearly indicated it could not have been Brett Kavanaugh\nYou see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance you\nAre incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when Israeli or left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said in twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely suddenly there was one boy and not for\n[noise]\n\nViewer over the age of fifty

in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor Ford through a any rigorous process that determined that voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was the ... the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out in fact she was a safe and some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says it's if it's accurate\nBut two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door\nAnd had nothing to do it cost her phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying we flew little planes all over French Polynesia and painting and or Hawaii\nWe also went on trips to Central America to South America and the euro she had no fear of flying it was a lie in fact there was nothing she said factually that turn out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about finding the truth\nThey had a ball face mitigated allegation\nThat could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said that\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar but then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me\nWith the facts that's what caused

state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there was hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red Jonathan signing would be an excellent for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the mission and the companies that are ... and then they only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the cities and what you would have is a situation where\nThe machine as program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast the Republican has an actual votes cast\nMachine is going to say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city that Democrats in most cases they're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the terms who's on the ballot and what have you know and the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm would a\nWave votes from Republican to add to the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest and coast to coast a month ago when

those continue their calls let's go to a Bob and the great state of Maryland Bob in Maryland Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Bob how are you\nA great deal about great to be with you and I have three things that I think we all my keep in mind as we go to the polls in November one is that just like you mentioned this woman who says that she doesn't care what happened she is glad she room Brett Kavanaugh's life wonderful what\nThe left and the Democrats have indeed done to others they try to do to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh will they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that\nThis over mine this entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people say people constructive in ten of these things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some\nVersion of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties [laughter] with the communist\nAnd their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do a it will provide a great context for the situation that we're in your Catholic as a mile or are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations in the sex abuse is and the official cover up\nThat that was actually very much started by the communists\nWhatever it was it's all those restaurants and we should be able to do it again let me\nTell you this Joseph Stalin the mass murder and Soviet dictator wanted the church undermine from within to neutralize the\nCemeteries and to eliminate the healing power of the church the the the free and empower the church in this country a woman named Ellen died who was a member of the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties late twenties and for Twenty years I\nIntroduced into the seminary placed in the American Catholics\nSeminaries one thousand one hundred men who were communists end up or no or low faith or morals and according to the plot money who were ... a sexually deviant once that was established then successive waves bought and more of these people and they work their way into the priesthood and ultimately end of the higher or\nMom and me say this if if the double themselves\nWant it to destroy the Roman Catholic faith he would have done exactly what many praised him and do in the past forty or fifty years and I want to go to deep into this but if the devil himself wanted to destroy Catholicism the double could not done done a better job than what I see going on\nLet's continue now with Patricia and the great state of Florida Patricia go ahead you're\nOn

I think people love it and they become pope Chuck throat sabotage of going through with it I think they should get up\nAt the one he adopted al ... thing and I\nMean pretty interesting isn't it wonderful that the Republican Party\nWhich has become conservative of late and the president has individuals like Dianne Feinstein Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Dick Durban to run against\nAnd Blumenthal of Connecticut the war hero isn't it wonderful to have someone like Elizabeth Warren to run against I mean you couldn't pick these caricatures any better\nIt ... you know but I don't come in and got caught in the game and crack the demon rats\nAnd why they have mental problems and a lot of rain that they take their personal background and the alive and I think that they can get anything anything they want to people and I don't really cool things come up with the women\nI haven't minding my own but yet they can you can lie more than anything and I think President Trump is wonderful yes when I'm wonderful\nHow 'bout how 'bout how 'bout senator Collins me what she did what Susan Collins about three o'clock yesterday afternoon\nWas fabulous watch Lindsey Graham played golf with the president today and then to watch and Mitch McConnell I mean this guy has bought my loyalty for the next two or three years I Love ...
