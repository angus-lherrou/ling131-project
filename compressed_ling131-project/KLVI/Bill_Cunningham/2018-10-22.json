there's no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit the American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have this benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that we\nPolicy and I think there's those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia they don't like that\nAnd I bought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon

you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president to privately it was wonderful you spent like\nHundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I said on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump and now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media\nYou know they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is he's exceptionally gracious I've seen in so many times\nHelping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help whenever he can\nWhat why is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what is going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center bows out well Brent proves out one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough the good\nThey only report the bad and this administration the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time in our nation's history they'd conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump getting interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes\nShe interrupted him sixty five times during that interview to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him more times\nHave their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad not to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he can because they no longer in the business\nOf reporting the news now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night Montana framed it as mobs\nVersus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh I look about a trucks that have a Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at the Republican\nCongressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with tens\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose them there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the cost of violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support for Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders sleeping with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence antifa is so out of control your goal on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president is created\nI think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences that Democrats I hate to say this\nAnd they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally it is acceptable to me the fame and to make fun of an industry or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw it on TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing ... in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of lot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick that Michelle Obama\nRipping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the uh the country artist would have had his life\nProbably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her new you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult he was president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the\nThe converse if Donald Trump had done that with during the media would be saying\nThey need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis\nBut you're exactly right it come through the system your check you are authorized to come and you pay whatever fair share it is there is either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country and how it works that that was always work and we just need to know better job and forcing that\nCorey Lewandowski lastly there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton\nIs making a run and twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady\nShe was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run\nI Would help her get signatures maybe raise the money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party standard ... wouldn't you do a great job\nWe love this look hundred and thirty two electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's reelection effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred\nAfter he beat Donald Trump\nBeat her by Seventy four electoral votes and what your listeners remember and when they woke up on election day of twenty sixteen the New York times and all those mainstream media outlets and Hillary Clinton as a Ninety nine percent\nChance of winning today Ninety nine percent when we get more than it was only two people on the ballot so I Want her to run I run when he wants to\nGo back through all of her email scandal all of that money that she's gotten from foreign governments when she was a secretary of state in the Clinton Foundation and the fact that she lost her security clearance let's go re litigated all let's quarterback in front of the Democratic party\nYou know core she'd be a wonderful candidate I mean I could not think of any one more qualified to represent the Democratic party than Hillary Rodham Clinton that would be a beautiful thing\nLook if if if you have my help I think you and I can encourage your ballot will clear the field critics I think on the superdelegates maybe you've heard of the that's how she stole\nThe last election from Bernie Sanders right well put them back and played shoring a system gets like she did it last time a little worse\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production and about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the head of the Republican game four or five seats that increasing the majority in the house I'm going to say that it's a bold protection the Republicans are going to hang on by two or three seats to retain the majority and keep the Trump Pence agenda moving forward\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski Trump campaign manager thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham showing my friend will do it

after him including Chuck Schumer in front of the record\nGang for me and not just a a girl it's a guy to and Chuck Schumer is the gang\nBecause he's a guy who was complicit in this uh later ah from New York they're all people they just want to watch somebody be destroyed over sick ideology known as left isn't and I think it's pathetic and the far reaching ramifications impact the guys like Bill Cosby\nWho sits in the prison at the age of Eighteen years old an American icon\nFits in prison in his eighties over allegations that date back four or five decades meanwhile a guy who vowed then I mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI thought it was amazing ... you had a situation where he actually raped a woman\nWho told us that one eight of Broderick when Clinton raped her what what's a bloody lamp told her a room mate what happened\nThe roommate solve the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating

House is president sexually groping in molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go to Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger doubled than it has to do more with men\n... me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too\nBecause a bunch of left this lecture it's Hollywood lefty okay it's the Harvey Weinstein of the world with all these young on your news and these old school actresses and all these ... political feminists\nTaking pictures at Harvey going to his party's next owning a virtue that awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting me to uh ended up being a bill\nEnds up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like cabin all they want to make him the poster child [laughter] um I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms of physicians would somebody a Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama selected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters ended the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from other connections but they couldn't care less as Harvey Weinstein was a star\nHarvey Weinstein and access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars in giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas so they sent their own daughters end of the carrot custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are on touchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there and a daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the the what the what ... rock Obama's selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that electorate left this who will take advantage of women and every time but I could put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary tale [noise] for many many boy I've said many times what harmless thing is your kid your son going to do at the age of Fifteen\nThat some woman's gonna come back twenty five thirty years later and say oh look at what you did to me more if he's not even going to remember it he is not it's going to be insignificant to him and her but\nBecause something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nYou know it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this was a terrible event for the Democrats over the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nOr in Honduras and the bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter

part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to get drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaigns are by a Tom Styron by Bloomberg another\nSee at the end plus your college football

Brett Kavanaugh having been\nA confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the fifth vote of the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS\nBut you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much harm is not causing us\nI think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for business is of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nActivities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each year it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses could so\nThat an important factor in fact a trillion dollars is more than the government actually ... ah either from businesses are from individuals each year they very\nSignificant thing but it can be turned back town on the couch and be reduced give me hold on\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and begin to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago I'm kind of generations ago and they are perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule and\nThere are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so\nThe court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the national guard it do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency then we can actually beginning to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen eighty seven\nArticle one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because it best reflects the will of the people in reality at least for the past fifty years it was perceived Congress is number one", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "22"}
