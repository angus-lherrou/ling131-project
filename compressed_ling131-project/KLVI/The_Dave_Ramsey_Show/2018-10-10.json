I guess you're a lot of fun so something happened and you're all lived three years and five months ago when a switch flip tell me what happened\nBut also a great story but it started five years ago today when we got married a very good two months after that we decided to buy a house and our debt went from about two hundred and fifty to three hundred and two thousand dollars ... and uh\nWe started on our own path not sharing the ... I was to pay off what I did and she was to pay off her part mhm and I I made a really brilliant decision and I bought a flu on a credit card oh good three hundred dollar\nHuge money argument was that an argument was an ultimatum well he said I'm not doing this again\nThis is a second marriage for both of us and now she had money problems before with her previous mhm and wasn't going to do it again so I said I don't know how to do it but I Know a guy who does\nAnd I let her over to the podcast and that started I wrote\nWhoa very cool very funny shows the flu to broke the camel's back up the aisle\nYour daughter from his first marriage and ah she the oldest is going to start band and he went home charged it and I thought why okay right now\nThat's yeah that's good you should you know buying your daughter a fleet that even makes more sense yeah [laughter] wow I just didn't so you play in the Florida I just know visualize\nAbout uh the firefighter the flu guy but yeah okay whatever [laughter]\nA good a fun very fun you guys OK so yeah you did look up and you realize last time a one lady told me she said my starter has been the first one\nShe said that time I figured out that this doesn't work and I'm not doing this again that's a good line that I've had it you had an I've had a moment and are they all said okay I'm with you I've had it\nAnd let's fix this so it was on a I'm a ... this long drawn out argument but it was kind of just hit the balls and no okay look this week we've got two ways that were there is a way that works in a way that doesn't work why we're doing it doesn't work\nExactly you know well and I had never really heard of before and I didn't even know how to use a pot cafes even know what a pod cast was and so when Dale charge the flute at the time we kept our finances separate ... and I said we are getting ready to go on a\nVacation Italy ... and I said I Can't do it if you if you have credit card debt mhm so we cancel that bowl and I went on a yoga retreat on my own ... in part of that retreat was four hours of meditation and I listen to your [laughter]\n\nWhich is a bit expensive two and a lot cumbersome\nUm consequently I was reading in financial planning magazine the other day article that said Seventy eight percent of the trust that are formed the never funded meeting people pay their stupid lawyer their financial advisor thirty five hundred bucks to build the trust and then they never retired all the stuff in the name of trust which means the trust has absolutely nothing it's got nothing in it\nAnd so it's a ... no value\nSo I don't use living ... uh I don't personally use living\nTrust and I have a substantial network with a lot of detailed estate planning\nNow I Do have some trust I have a couple of trust here or there but the they have different functions then what this guy is describing and she'll know I Would not build the trust now you can set up and you have your attorney or a state planning attorney do this not your financial advisor\nI trust to a family trust to be formed upon your death\nAnd upon your desk the money if both of you die and yet minor children the money goes into a trust and then it's management to go to the children was talking about that in the first segment of the shower\nAnd um or a second second one of this hour I guess but you can do that that's that's not that hard to do and it doesn't really cost anything because there's no trust being formed in no trust happening unless both of you died I had that in my will when my children were minors\nAnd then of course my will has changed since the children are of age there are no longer legally children emotionally either for that matter with her and we go so I mean some of your children that are emotionally still minors but of chronologically moved on like the guy [laughter]\nThirty Years' old ask him what he did for a living and I'm a stay at home son [laughter] I'm a stay at our own sun [laughter] what your butt in the street [laughter] my sweaters mice in Chicago [laughter] Hey Mike how are you\nI'm good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nSo I uh have a baby step too I have a ton of medical bills um and recently I was originally paying ten bucks a month for a medical bills that I had a they stopped it was an automatic withdraw and they stopped taking out and they've since my\nAccount to collections and then to a lawyer and refinance filming to court mhm I'm I'm just trying to figure out what my\nOptions are all if I Need to hire a lawyer or what I Need to do\nMuch is on that bill a Fifteen\nSixty one thousand five hundred and sixty okay and what's your household income\nOr about Seventy five thousand dollars for them and what ten dollars a month because of all the other bills\nYeah I got all campaign hundred dollars in medical bills and a lot of credit cards is while student loan\nSo what's what's the total medical bill balance\nOf all the medical bills and I have are probably Fifteen thousand dollars mhm [noise] and my daughter just diagnosed with a few other medical issues that more bills will be coming show\nHow they get a dollar and a three okay and what were the medical issues or she\nHas what's called ... syndrome a a carry mail formation and then she was diagnosed with epilepsy ...\n\nOkay you gotta do you guys are at a hard time with this little baby girl honey\nYeah yeah she's got you know ever since she was ... actually have a lot of things\nGoing on [noise] [noise] and how much credit card that do you have a lawyer probably\nAt twenty five thousand dollars mhm\nAnd how much student loan that yeah\nThat one's up there that's about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ... who's the doctor [laughter] I'm just a teacher my wife has stayed home um [noise]\nHuh [noise] All right\nUm well what normally\nHappens if you have a heart\nAnd you're a good person and you have a baby that is sick you pay all of your attention to the baby and it drains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that's ... that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and the good husband\nYou guys are not paid attention to the money at all and all that means is your human but his screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right [noise] yeah\nSo as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore I'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans if they're not already on hardship referral\nUm if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars and offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum settlement they'll take it\nMhm okay because we called today are very feminine federally call today at least that you know we ... what can we do and they just said\nUm you can either pay the full amount plugged in court fees and attorney feed them or hire a lawyer and when the when court\nOkay and you can call them back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle this debt which one do you want to\nBe okay and what if they don't take that and then\nYou how you keep messing with the national weather and messing with them\nBecause they're gonna listen you're dealing not with an attorney you're probably not even to another paralegal\nYou're dealing with a large law firm that runs medical collections through like a widget in a factory this is your life at your daughter it's the illness and the struggles it's got a lot of emotion tied to it to them they have no soul there is nothing to this thing except you're just a number on a page\nAnd they have a whole bunch of numbers on a page\nThey talked to her style thousand people argue every single day and they give everybody the exact same script\nOkay this is not like you owe me money and I called them we would actually talk about it you're dealing with a robot in a factory and if you get that yeah tucked in your head when you're talking to the person on the other line it's emotional to you it is not to them\nIt's a robot in a factory\nLike a movie okay and just keep that amount and just keep going well I don't have that so does that computer for you you know can you compute that I don't have Fifteen hundred dollars and that may go into court or you're taking me to court doesn't make me have Fifteen hundred dollars I simply do not have it I Do have five hundred and sixty two and you're going to have every bit of that\nAnd if you have every bit of that you have to get a settlement and full nor will not give it to you as a partial payment to get started\nNo I'm not going to put this on payments that doesn't work for me and it hasn't worked for you but I Will settle this with you for pennies on the dollar and you're going to be lucky to get that 'cause I got so much that coming out my ears from this little girl that I'm pretty sick or you people and I'm thinking about found bankruptcy and giving you a zero anyway\nAnd you are having these conversations with these idiots okay now you legitimately all the money so we got to work with them but you know you just\nKeep it all of its ... ended up going to court\nIt ended up going to court then they will take a judgment against you you don't need an attorney you're going to lose okay cause you owe them money and they were in before the judge and the judge says Mike the all the money and you say yes and he goes guilty [noise]\nRight over it as a matter if we tell them you know my daughter's fifth grade I had all his hair I don't cook her I don't care if the industrial side of the medical world they don't care I'm Sorry I Wish they\nDid but I Do and so just try to satellites and then let's put together systems and worked out of this whole mess
