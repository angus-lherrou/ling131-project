how are you I'm good how are you There God welcome to Dave Ramsey show how can I help [noise]\nWe my wife and I are looking at downsizing I'm personally to help clear up to that um [noise]\nOur income has gone down about forty percent in the last two years why I'm compensation at because of health care\n[noise] my wife the position and compensation from insurance companies and one has gone down considerably and we um\nWe built a dream home and moved in about six and a half years ago and it's a wonderful place but we are becoming a house for because of the you know lack of income so\nWhat was your household income before and what is it now\nIt was about four eighty and this year was about two Seventy\nFive okay and most of that is her\nCorrect I work two part time jobs going in there for three children ... and how much do you own your home [noise] about eight forty and what is the payment on that a just a quick thirty nine Ninety five is shorter four thousand a month gotcha okay\nNow it's it's um uh it's on the coast of waterways where have you tried to plug churn taxes ... a truce or or monthly you know when your factoring types of insurance is concerned with our\nGotcha okay All right and do you have no other dead or is it\nOh no we have about a hundred and fifty which is mostly credit cards and student loan okay\nWe've kind of accumulated those credit cards over the last few years of trying to figure out you know whether we were going to wear the compensation was in ... you know return to previous levels and we just don't want to wear house for a longer in the house was probably worth about a million and a half mhm\nSo we're looking at um [noise] getting house back in town um we actually found one mhm that um [noise]\nIf we purchase it it'll be on a Fifteen year and it'll be a little under twenty five percent of our take home okay\nAll right and with with the world looking at was the amount of equity in our current all we can pay off every bit of a we have except for what we all have on a new house which\nAnd still be still be at that number to Fifteen Percent number or the twenty five percent number of Fifteen year\nIt'll be a little bit under actually okay\nThat's what yeah but that clears the debt and everything okay here's all the young I'm definitely not doing that and um the ... that all sounds like it's very wise uh especially to the extent that you\nFeel like that this is permanent this change of income is what our minute and there's nothing you can do to fix it um you know\nA change in direction with the way way she practices or what she does or you know what what you know is there a whole new business model that she can go out our practice with the changes it but even then if that worked and she got her income back up to half a million you could buy another house\nExactly that's what I told her you know if we if we do the split by the cost of the numbers are going to be\nFired six thousand a month to the good at minimum yeah yeah and we have a sixteen Thirteen and ten year olds who are looking at more cars to purchase more insurance for cars college is coming up but we we have about three quarters of a million and retirement savings we have five twenty ... to ... you know we have proper insurance\nDown in Atlanta and we don't need to go crazy on kids cars here ... is the thing is I don't want you to move down and relax the pressure to figure out is there a way to get the income backup I Want you to look down and keep the pressure on is there\nWay to get the income back up just for the fun of it because you know right I have a million ... fun to make it again\nExactly how to remove it includes me there's not a script on the beautiful house to house that everyone would love to live in it you know I'm not going to be able to see the sun come up with the Atlantic every morning but I can live without that\nYeah and ... and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we've got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna ... we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are are for the next two years or whatever it takes to turn it around absolutely I make this move\nDefinitely make that move it all sounds very logical to me good question I ride Derek with us in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the Dave Ramsey\nShow hey how's it going his honor to talk to you have you too sir how can I help\nYeah you're ... you're talking a money maker her book or just changed our lives I got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gifts we implemented it and they uh twenty two thousand dollars a month and then that bin ... free sense so it's been awesome good um\nBy question to you need your help with this because sometimes I feel like I'm controlled by fear and over stinking when you quit your day job which is good to go fulltime entrepreneur\nDo you have the full time job or do you have the entrepreneur gig running [noise]\nYeah that's what my wife does she sells the clothing for the ... um [noise] and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic\nJust trying to figure out when that time is to leave that retirement benefits the security you wouldn't believe it was\nThat I never heard of it has ... the pain is unbelievable how much are are you still over white then as it is so shared with obesity\nWell it's not but the only [laughter] so they had I had him in high school and then I didn't have him for Nineteen years and the only thing that happened after Nineteen years where they gave weight known that when I started again so I'm I'm trying not to open that that might be\nYeah okay so what do you why now so I weigh about two sixty now okay and you lost forty pounds she said for what you have about forty three pound them and I'm Still going um let me know still do and it's going strong in that\nOK okay goodness good for you well done thank you yeah I mean when that kind of pain though you can learn to do a lot of different things that we found out there\nUm so I you know 'cause I I'm I'm not only mildly curious about this um in terms of bless your heart the pain you've got but the uh the truth is is that the financial troubles are going to continue as long as you continue having a ten thousand dollar bill every three months right\nExactly and um I assume you've got health insurance I Do\nSo when you have a kidney stone event what is your out of pocket cost\nBetween two and six thousand dollars per yeah okay and what is your household income or about sixty sixty sixty five I think\nYou know and so if you budget twelve thousand a year for medical\nOn out of that it does make it hard to get some traction\nRight well especially with our credit card debt that we're that we've we we paid off twenty five thousand we thought about thirty laps so we're we're making headway but you know the the hospital bills are going up at the same time\nYou know why I Would just give you permission to look let's win this medical battle and not expect huge headway until you do yeah because\nYou take sixty thousand miles twelve thousand you don't and then by the way you want to eat out of that too\nA you're not going to make mega mega headway on this debt until you solve this medical problem but if you can stay even not going to hold or and or make some\nProgress while you solve this bigger issue then as soon as that's gone um you know you're going to be a new man in so many ways\nRight\nSo I mean I I just cannot see this being something that you go oh twice a year I have a kidney stone for the next four years I I just that that just is not a that's not tenable scenario to me so I I think something is figure it out here along the way\nIn the process I I just can't ... maybe there are people that do that I don't know I've never heard\nOf that but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist I'm not a medical professional by any stretch so um but let's say that it takes two years to solve this and you know that's twenty four thousand dollars out of pocket the ...\nComing up you know well that's just going to be\nThat is what you're fighting you know you just got this thing you're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and let's let's win the battle that you're fighting and that's the the battle for your health\nTo get your health back on Bush's er wow ouch ow Brooke is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi Brooke how are you\nGuys have cable I but I said I already know the answer to that [laughter] I was actually calling I was wondering I'm\nOnly you mentioned you know you were a lot of school and I had a crush it even more so I'm back ... aspect of it you know like I'm twenty four I took a little bit of student loans that aren't bad habit I charge money they're getting like\nA lot more and grants I'd probably won't even have to look at them again until I have to be adding any idea what\nI'm trying to work as much as I Know yeah but you have any advice for can measure like trying to ... he was trying to get like\nSome of it is also in the schools and I was wondering what your child that they have already that's what she looks a little longer school side\nYou know well the first thing you do is your budget obviously your time for ... for your classes and a new budget your time for your study around your classes and in the new budget work\nI'm social comes after that I'm older than I Am most people if they throw a brick through their television they found about thirty hours a week and um that's pretty amazing right there\nI mean people ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore and I'm not mad about television I don't think the devil's in there although he probably is having a pretty good time there but um it's not like it's something like that it's not like a spiritual thing it's just a matter of what do I want to spend my time on that gives me\nMy best life I spend my time on grandbabies children wife\nMe work reading\nThese or do you know a long time before I spend my time she'll just being intentional with your time you'll be amazed how much time I mean you know how many ... you'd be amazed how many people spend two hours a day on Facebook\nAnd they talk about a colossal freaking waste of time there's one so um if you just stayed off social media completely or virtually ... almost completely and he turned off your television you can make a pretty good living with that time\nThe second thing I Would do other than that is other than getting away from time oysters and budgeting my time is your best income production things at your age wall in school when you need to control your time\nAre typically some kind of self employed or straight commission slash self employed idea\nAt twenty four years old you can make more money ... and babysitting\nYou make Fifteen twenty bucks an hour doing that\nYou can make more money cleaning people's houses you can make twenty five or thirty dollars an hour doing math and neither one of these things require extremes levels of skill\nI mean yes you obviously know something about children and it would be good if you had CPR at the Y. you taking the class and got certified and so All right but and\nYou know those those sorts of things but you can make really good money and control your time or book the times that you're willing to do those things around her classroom time\nDoing that so do away with the time oysters intentionally budget your time and look for self employed and or straight commission ideas where when you work you get paid very well and you control when you work\nAnd work a lot I was selling real estate in college now that's a very unusual college activity but I grew up in a real
