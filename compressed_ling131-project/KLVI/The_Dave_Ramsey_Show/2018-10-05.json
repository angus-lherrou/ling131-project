actually on my screen your debt free congratulations\n... recall anything like that phrase grain\nLove it how much of you guys paid off four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars how long does that say about Tony for months man and your range of income during that time\nYeah we started off at about a hundred K. and that we picked it up to about three hundred thousand\nWow what are you guys do for a living\nSo I'm an executive recruiter for GE and then um I also teach part time with a multitude of an on line universities\nAnd and I'm a director in HR ... like\nOh God that's my friends very cool so you're working for Robert okay that's a good for you guys\nWere great income four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars what kind of that was that\nYeah it was basically do the loans the majority of it about three hundred and Seventy about actually dangerous sixty nine thousand of dollars about student loans and tax bill we had about twenty nine thousand [noise] and then are too small credit card about forty five hundred and ... wedding at about Fifteen thousand hey\nYou guys have a law student loan debt oh yeah [laughter] yeah well you know ... or you just overwhelmed by that that oh yeah oh yeah a lot about it so uh did you cash flow every bit of this\n[noise] [noise] oh yeah yeah we\nI mean you just that that's an amazing number twenty four months even with the fabulous income you've had that still very incredible very well on so tell me your story what happened twenty four months ago\nThat found and she and I were engaged and and we had it came to the table with bike has college education and then my college education and and it was astronomical so we'd have to realize like outlets and battling and very easy for it though\nMuch when we first started and our marriage we immediately got on the bandwagon to pay off and are standing around\nAnd my sister and she had actually introduced um you two are the only about Fifteen Years ago and I remember\nFeeling I remember that feeling of being overwhelmed and I told him she was like hey I'm Dave Ramsey really helped a lot with just the budgeting to get this out of the way and so we just kind of knew like this that we didn't have the peace I'm really first to to just live life with a student loan\nSo and we both made the decision to just start off and really from the very beginning where like where you're going to do that again is while extreme but we are going to do that\nI mean you guys you had an extreme situation so you brought extreme measures to deal with it\nBut he has very you know other choice [noise]\nWow amazing so what do you tell people the key to paying 'cause I mean you're the story everybody's talking about you know in in the news and all these these young people are overwhelmed with student loan debt they're all dying they're gonna you know their whole generations stunted and all this stuff and yet\nTwenty four months later you're done with four hundred and Eighteen thousand you're impressive\nThat's amazing so what in the world what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nUm I Would probably say just getting on the same page um you know we've been married now for about two and a half years and I think just getting on on kind of just getting out of bed and being on the same page in terms of our money I think that was really huge um you know just getting on the same page and also not being afraid of hard work\nUm you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really like it you say that\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God look down and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that kind of happened with with us 'cause\nYou know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors and we were able to pay off with a much quicker re a lot quicker than we thought because\nLike we didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just looking at all the student loans we thought how are you gonna pay this off how are we going to get home do all these different things started family but um you know definitely go with our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this in a pretty good time\nYou know how how do you explain to other people will cause I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity\nYou would do what we call the baby steps and the first baby step as you say the thousand dollars\nA as a starter emergency fund anything above that and we stop all retirement temporarily anything above that we throw at our debts not counting our house using the debt snowball and that's where you list your debts not counting your how small is the largest\nPay minimum payments on everything but the little one an attack the little ones so that would dictate that we would throw a lot of this money at that\nThan babysit once you're out of debt but the house then baby step three years you return to the one thousand dollar account raise it up to three to six months of expenses and then [noise]\nUh I'm\nPast that you restart your retirement sharp putting Fifteen Percent away for retirement start saving for kids college pay off your house earliest baby steps six so the house is way down the list so it it's not even going to come up you're not get into the house right now you know in the money [noise]\nSo then we bring in this idea of I'm going back to school to be a nurse which was an awesome goal uh not only will you be very employable you have the ability make really good money and um and can really adjust your schedule\nIn crazy ways to really double your income if you want to for short periods of time I mean you got all kinds of options and nursing that are going to be really good for you and your family\n[noise] um so are we the return on investment the investment into Austin is a really good investment\nBecause of your field of study you know you're not you're not getting a degree and left handed puppetry here this was actually a good degree and so\nIt's worth every penny you're spending on it and and a bunch more is what I'm saying so if we're if our goal is to get out of debt so that we can build wealth than the first step of that before we start anything else to say no more new debt\nYou can't get out of debt while you're getting into debt that you can't get out of a holding off the bottom right so that means we got a cash flow college so what's college going to cost\nA it's about three thousand dollars a semester and semesters\nA it's probably at least three years' worth of school\n... years three years of school so I'm thinking really twelve maybe so you\nYou didn't complete your undergrad already then\nNo I mean I'm I'm a baby in in college I I'm just now starting I mean it's a semester one I haven't you know this\nIs okay but you don't have enough you don't have an undergrad under your belt that you're adding a nursing degree to rye rye okay so you got to finish up some undergrad or do some undergrad and then move into ... so you need a three thousand a semester\nTimes three our our I'm Sorry I taught for three years you said is where I was going to take you and so six thousand dollars a year for three years Eighteen thousand bucks right\nYeah something like that OK okay and what's your household income\nUm it it was about sixty thousand dollars and my wife were having our first baby next well in the beginning of November\nWhat's your household income during the next three years going to average\nProbably around forty to forty five thousand dollars whoa\nOkay so you're not going to have a lot of cash to finish school and you have how much is savings\nOr twelve thousand okay oh I get\nThe good in that emergency on fourteen thousand\nYour emergency fund a small yeah okay yeah I think your total money make over baby steps are on hold until we get college paid for\nOkay so I'm going to set the twelve thousand over in my college fund and it needs to be Eighteen as my very first gold\nAnd then when it gets to Eighteen then we can talk about building the uh you know when you talk about taking the emergency phone down to a thousand and start working on the other\nThat's how much other data got not counting your house\nOr the car how much do you do on the car it's about twenty five thousand oh lord and you make forty five well at the time we uh we made like I said I made about sixty sixty\nFive dollars and car if you're going to be making forty five thousand this car does not fit in your goals for the next three years\nOkay mathematical insanity\nI mean look at look at these numbers we got an Eighteen thousand dollar a you know investment into Austin which we've agreed is a really good investment we we've got three thousand dollars to our name we got a forty five thousand our household income\nAnd twenty thousand dollar car no I Need to hear like five thousand dollar cars what I Need to hear\nOkay in the middle of this because cars not your goal right now your goal is to get all this mess cleaned up and get your education and your belt and double your income which is what's gonna happen\nOkay agreed yeah so a car\nGet you get you a much much much cheaper car so that you hit these goals cause you what you're doing is you're paying a price to when you're living like no one else so that later you get to live like no one else\nBut this car as it stands out as you had this have this really logical really smart a whole thing going on until we got to the car and then we went to stupid land\nIt just it just sticks out it doesn't it doesn't fit in your equation it doesn't even fit in your life is like you all had a you know a really bad impulse one day and you know just went off the ranch or something I don't know but even if you're making sixty five it didn't fit it was ridiculous purchased so it's just way too high\nAnd even if you paid cash for it in all of the middle all this so it wouldn't have made sense ... time to time to move that puppy and then let's live our lives is it good news is you'd rather than you want man 'cause your income is going to be eighty\nWhen you're finished with this and you're able to pay cash and\nYou know but you can't have these blockers in your way that you're trying to get around the elephant in the room that says car it it seems and killing you it's killing your plan it it's it's just it's death so anyway that's what I Would do and I think you guys are really smart and I think you'll do it\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Doug is on Twitter is it normal to continually adjust my budget during the first month\nYes\nAnd it is okay to adjust your budget continually during the first month if\nIt is not because you're out of control being immature impulsive if it is instead because you didn't estimate properly\nLike for instance you didn't have enough set aside for food\nAnd it wasn't because you went out to eat every night and you were a jerk it was because you just didn't have enough set aside for food you only had an unrealistic budget for food and you're discovering life looks different than your theory and you adjust that\nBut I have to continually adjust my budget so that I get to do whatever the flip I Want no that's not a good idea\nOf people do that but that's not a good idea\nSo your budget is to give you a guideline but it takes about three months of doing your budget trial and error adjust trial experiment trial adjust experiment adjust experiment adjust to get a completely dialed in and the first month you're going to have we always laugh and say you got forty to emergency budget committee meetings\nBut those are to adjust only the things\nThat you miss estimated or you just forgot and it is something that's real on something as important it's not like oh we've been on a budget for two days and I'm like really tired of that I Want to go out to eat no that's not what I'm Talking about [noise] [noise]\nNo I just you know I'm really you know just this is really stressful I've been doing it for three hours now you know that's not what we're talking about we're talking about you just missed your food budget or you didn't put anything aside for repairs and even think about and then you have a car repair gee you have to stop and adjust for that and pay for that\nAnd so yeah you gonna continually adjusting for three months you're first month the worst second month\nThe next month and that's how it's going to play out slowly but surely it's hard to adjust your impulses list as today [noise] um\nGuy child producer of the day brand new show on the side to announce the we're now hearing the hundred and radio stations
