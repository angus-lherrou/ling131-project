months but it's a step at a time\nCool so how much do you have personally\n[noise] um well our\nFinancial together now they're not together you're not married\nOkay gets me I have about eleven thousand in credit card debt okay and that's it I Know how I have a five thousand dollar car mhm and I have about forty four thousand seven hundred in student loan\nOkay cool and what does he have\nHe has only a car a ... eleven thousand four hundred okay\nAnd what is his income his income is about thirty eight thousand and what is your income about thirty three thousand or when are you wanting to get married ones the wedding in September twenty ninth next year oh country got twelve much good\nGod okay so you're not going to be a hundred percent that free and pay cash for a wedding between the two of you with that income those debts math but I think he would like to do our best\nExactly oh I didn't want you to do poorly understand you're just just observing mathematically we're not going to knock all of that out yet so given that that's the situation we need to have a modest wedding would you agree with that\nYes okay so we do have help from his parents my parents oh good how much are they chipping in um well his parents are paying for the catering and the reception that in which the huge ... of it yeah and then um\nThe venue is free we're getting married at the Capitol Grounds so that'll very good and then um we my parents pay for\nThat dress and then they are paying off though for um the limited free alcohol that will be there\nAnd okay phenomenal good and so uh what do you guys need to put in to add to this\nI'm I'm hoping to stay around eight thousand for what for decoration I'm renting things like for the linens and stuff like that and flour if you think that's too much\nYeah I've done to really really nice weddings with two daughters are like really nice things and um I mean you've got the big dog in the wedding is the reception usually the typical wedding mhm it's at least fifty percent of your budget usually\nThe dress and the you know the the camera and the venue is usually aren't hiring the preachers not usually that much sell our friend\nIs actually doing it right so so we've got you know we generally speaking really you've got the big things covered here [noise] um yeah you're probably a little rich just for leanings linens a lot of people have really nice wedding the whole wedding for ten grams\nOkay and the national average is less than thirty\nOkay for a ... princes Diana type weddings okay I mean you know yeah [laughter] right so um\nMy mom always says I have um champagne taste with a beer budget\nYeah well I kinda let me too that that's how I went broke so [laughter] so if I'm you know it's not a big deal but I'm going to back that down in the spirit of\nWe want to get out of debt and so I I'm going to just make up a number you guys can adjust it your adults you and your ... you and your fiance talk about it okay we're both handy I liked him making things I'm going to say I'm going to say let them cover the stuff they're covering and you put in five K. duck and cover up OK okay you you could change it\nYou could get for you could make it eight you can change it later OK okay but whatever we do I'm going to put that in the bank first\nOkay before you start your total money might go okay it's going to go ahead and bank five grand between the two of you and I want you to do that and you\nSay to save up for the wedding and then\nHey you know and I want you to do that in like too much okay perfect and then two months I Want it passed by Christmas yeah we can do that okay\nAnd then we're going to start the debt snowball eat chicken visually\nDo not run your money together until you're married I Know you said you were to bad idea it's bad for your budding uh engaged relationship it's really bad legally because if something God Forbid happens and I believe me I've been coaching folks for Thirty years and I see things happen that aren't nice okay [laughter] and it's stuff\nLike a car wreck or something weird okay and you just all kinds of stuff happens and if he has paid off a bunch of your debt and you're not married it's it's it's a problem and that's really what setting up here so\nUm the\nThe other way you could do this since you've got a whole lot more than ... you could just attack your debt snowball and he could build up to five grand\nOkay I just don't want to make him pay for that all\nWell in a sense he's not because of the day we get married it's all combined mhm and so he's not paying for it we're paying for it okay if as long as it combines on September twenty ninth there's no you paid for it I paid for it okay this is our money at that point right yeah because here's the thing if if he\nUm pays off the eleven thousand dollars he should be debt free\nYeah and you guys ought to have the wedding\nAnd then we got you to deal with when you get to come home from the honeymoon and okay the actual going to have Sallie Mae moving in your spare bedroom right well we already do I know but I mean she's still going to be there when you get out and the honeymoon yes got to get rid of VIX you'll notice I owe the next year or two but we're hoping yeah the thing is just lay out a plan that both of you agree to\nOkay but please don't I don't want him paying your dad's\nOkay it gets weird okay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that\nJust possible downside is all there and the upside is very little if\nYou get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered and huge debt free and he wants to pay on it it's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write checks tortured that okay\nBut then if something God Forbid happen everything's still separated between now and then okay and I'm so cool cool congratulations ...\nYou have to it's called the book the total money make over hold on Kelly's going to pick up emotion that out to you very cool stuff open phones or triple eight eight to five five two to five or ... is on Facebook that when you started your company did you borrow money for a start up expenses no joy don't borrow

speaking in that paid for the printing and we lost a thing called life after death with an overhead projector and a bad suit and it was a class that became a\nFinancial piece university and every time a medal of money we bought a little bit more stuff and grew the company a little bit ... one hundred percent organically which all that means is is the money we made we put back into the company after we ate a little bit of food\nAnd pay a little bit of light bills and um we're just poured it back in the company quarterback and the company quarterback and the company um but we never borrow money which means that some things we wanted to do we weren't able to do\nAnd you know what to do to protect us from doing some stupid stuff cause some stuff we wanted to do that with the money do stupid stuff and if you do something stupid\nAnd you pay cash for it it doesn't hurt near as much as if you do something stupid and get the payments are stupid and business you're gonna do some stupid stuff in business Ninety percent of your other shot from your\nSurvive and make all your money on ten percent of your ideas and you don't know which ones they are don't borrow money and this was oh\nSome

Fox News President Trump and Houston taxes to support for Senator Ted Cruz\nThe people of Texas are going to re elect a man who is become a really good friend of mine you know we're a little difficult\nYou know same thing so can you get a share of early education and be fine out here yeah most of us function on that we didn't go to ... schools that were a hundred grand a year your kids aren't going to either unless you're going to run them deeply in debt which I wouldn't recommend so we show you call you know your local\nIn state tuition schools that you think your kids might go to and you find out how much it is\nAnd we have we've gotten a pretty good start on that we have a great program here in Iowa that are high school kids are able to take college courses for free and a lot of are a lot of the kids graduate with not only to high school diploma but also they're two year degree at our local community college we are\nHighly advising children could do that and you're out of out of the fact that they're already doing that and taking college classes yeah and I'm going to a man in college you said community college is free\nWell if you are taking classes while you're in high school ... yeah cool yeah\nWell the other thing you can do is if you don't do that and you graduate from high school you still can go to community college about a third the cost of the typical in state college four year college\nAnd not here for two years if you don't have your first two years of stuff studies out a way because most of that's just core stuff anyway and and you just make sure that that community college or transfer full credit into you know I'm I don't know University of Iowa or wherever it is are going to go right\nAnd wrong and our our state or whatever it is you just look at that and you lay it out and you say this is where we are going to go this is what it's going to cost and then you back into your budgets on it and go okay Seventeen year old we're going to be casual so college choice is your biggest variable in a kid going to college\nDebt free variable number two is they make their part time job filling out for scholarships\nYeah jump on learning suddenly filling out scholarship money and um you know we're we're meeting parents and kids who were\nYou know that they're they're getting two hundred and fifty twelve hundred and fifty twenty two hundred and fifty dollar scholarships and add them all up in a pile and they turned out to be thirty grand and they pay for school not a bad part time job when you're Seventeen\nAnd you work your butt off filling out like a Brazilian of those things not ten but hundreds of scholarship applications and you try to get the third thing is you take a class on how to take the ACT not just take the ACT\nSAT depending on which ... which applies to your particular situation and get your scores up\nBecause ... that a little bit of tutoring or a class on how to take that test will jump your scores substantially uh with the typical kid and that qualifies you for yet more stuff and then the last one is juniors going to be working\nWhile in school you're going to be working all a view that worked while you're in college raise your hand\nI see hands going up all over America okay all of us work while we were in college why do we think that's child abuse for this generation is not child abuse builds character I worked forty to sixty hours a week while I was in school and I got through in four years\nAnd my grade students so for its suffered it would have been for other reasons like not working hard enough for something like that but I worked my butt off and um you can too\nAnd you got to be smart about it you're not going to get through school you know a flop and whoppers for minimum wage at Burger

then just didn't sound right\nAnd we knew that you are his parents actually given us an eager to ... when we got engaged okay Manhattan but it just didn't click back then and then watch them\nNo no well ... watch because now we watch them that we stopped at a ... and just didn't stick to it on a cell and I knew that you went on line found that you had an ad and I had about an hour and a half hour commute each way to work\nNow I listen to your podcast and I\nYeah I heard you tell a capital that was on base that too that they're ... they can't go on any vacations and that's when it's ... like we can't do any of that stuff we need to\nReally buckled down half our debt so that's when I came home to him and tell them no vacations we're going to get started\nTo which he was really excited to go all\nThe wrong side of a a dang a payout pay off dead or go golfing and Florida Keys or something I'm like ooh [laughter] our choice I guess is that I I Am\nBut the good news is you're out of debt now and I'm like no one else later you can ... it was like no one there's no what do you tell people to key to getting out of that as you probably thirty thousand and Thirteen much for\nMe at that budget sticking to the ... that we never and stuck to it through the ... that always change we knew we had extra cash will be do then spontaneous spending\nAs a planning the for each month happened and loves the every dollar Applebee's it all the time cool and so yeah I just sticking to that budget and planning ahead and just delaying sunnier and things that you'd want and just waiting

to see a split out I'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in the whole thing and get me to the top ... more goals driven in that way but we do about it I'm going to far\nBut on the refrigerator right when we were on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in that it's kinda like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous yup this was it was like hey we're the ... were in debt\nI Am not I was our way of being honest and I ended up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo that people look at your luck curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nYou know it was a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nI mean even people commit crimes within the U.S you know if they should a pot and get injured you still take 'em to the hospital and you make them well so don't don't think it's okay to work on foreign oil but regardless you said something on the podcast I'll listen on friday where he said that the ... uses that are\nAre just sort of subtly persuade people do lean are certain direction and I had an epiphany moment at that point and what I thought was you know that's why they hate Trump so much his his rallies aren't as much as you know this is my policy it's\nStandup comedy act to use it that are all the time to effectively made fun of his political aren't I think that's why I laughed at the media really hate so much\n[noise]\nYes I agree [noise] um he also he also gives event he he not given he gives his audience an opportunity\nTo\nVent their ... leans over things that upset them and anger them in a way that I think Republicans for better or for worse you can have your own opinion as to whether this is a good idea or not but\n[noise]\nPeople are angry about Hillary Clinton because they feel like she got away with committing crimes and other people wouldn't mean even Anthony wiener went to prison\nAnd and you see people who who go to prison for relatively minor\nInfractions compared to what the ... the Clinton's did and people say it's not fair it's not right it is on just\nThere is in in in the character of Americans there is\nThis sense of righteous justice that a lot of the world does not have\nThe there is a sense that Rome's must be right it you know my wife has commented to me many times\nThat Americans are unique people in that when we quote unquote conquer a country rather than taking over their government\nWe share with them are skill set we share with them our treasure we we lend to them we teach them our systems I mean it's an active extraordinary kindness\nBut it's who we are after vanquish in the Japanese\nWhat did the United states do ... rebuild\nAfter World War two what did the United states do but rebuild\nThere were lending facilities there were there were there were outright investments there were a there was teaching in sharing of knowledge and expertise\nAnd look

Trump understands that and the media doesn't want that because they're the hill they're the bad guy there the weather and I'm really the heel or just outright bad guy\nI'd never been in the room when

never for a moment of doubt that there was any threat to them it was like bowling the ... twins everybody got what was going on that he is able to allow people to express\nThese things that the Republican Party keeps telling them you can't have those views I Will scold color for saying\nThat we should engage in violence toward these individuals coming up here because that's not the right
