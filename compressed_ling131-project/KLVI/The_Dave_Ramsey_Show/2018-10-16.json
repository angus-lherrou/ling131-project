there's a couple of things that are going to go along with me agreeing to be your executor\nUm otherwise I Can't be your executor number one is I have to know what every detail of your situation is\nAnd that includes reading the wheel and understanding the wheel and going over it with your lawyer number two is all of those affected by the will have to be informed before your death what the

of the executor ship because those are my terms for serving as executive does that sound unreasonable do you\nNot at all I I appreciate that's how I was feeling as well ... ...\nYeah that's exactly what I Would do and by the way if he won't take you off as soon as he dies you step before the judge and say I refuse it I'm not gonna take it I told him while he's alive I'm not going to do it and
