you know their rights or things in this country and we'll talk about them later but you know basically we we started talking about suffering ourselves from this game and\nMaking sure that we stole from some real hard on us over the next day\nOne final thing give a Mason bugs and Rodney rental both are looking for new careers that can be band directors [laughter]\nYou know I I and I I make this comment you know the best thing about the gays\nFor me was the reaction I get the kids were lower decide in a you know you look up and you see Romney random elimination by their office on your family that are actually tell you about how excited some off of them was you know it was it was on like I'm a case of the most fun and bomb us\nHappened about six thirty in the last of the methods that gang or no doubt about that so uh it was good and it was great to have those guys they really enjoy the game and ah you know but like I said we kinda we had to get your Sunday and we got the phrase is going on in the next with demand actually got involved\nDuring the game because they got a warning during the day did they really didn't know the\nNow I got to tell you something I kind of lumped into yeah I have no problem with that I'm On I'm actually\nBeen to the school where they had to go to the director of that I expect you to get a warning and I'm being serious I explain how\nThe word the the the biggest way up until the whistle up until the lines of scrimmage housing or\nYou can play up until the malls alone back into action in at that point they've got to be made it out and I guess there was at one point the press box where I'm at I you know we didn't hear the band yeah but I think that they were playing a they were playing right up in ... when the ball and then after\nThat I Would imagine that game that complaint from the bottom line they sort of works out of line and ah which is you know which is right they they had every right to complain but I'm the referee came over and told me\nHe said you're fixes you basically get a warning that over here for more\nCan they can tell I mean\nYou know actually actually they can't actually I can I mean I it's like I got to tell you I got a warning right through a flag on me I was way back I was in the box that they work where the referee supposed to work right I finally was about a foot in in the Nineteen running by any kind of\nRushing it half pressed that I didn't I\nWasn't in the way he didn't triple me or anything else and he turned around the flag and ... it was just a warning right and then if I got to tell you something I kinda got him back across you know they have their area from the sidelines to write back there and then it turns white and the coaches they're well one time he came back and he put his foot in the white\n[laughter] hey hey get out in my area that fire fire in my area and he died last but you're going to lie down though we're both just laughed about it so it was kinda funny\nI think the ban actually enjoyed it when the when the warning was called from what I've been told that a lot of the ban they turn around and got on the missiles and basically the oh big man a mental wise that's come after a big fan of a enjoyed it\nI loved it all for the band you know that that was great\nI Am too I mean is you know there are students as well as the student involvement and then that's what it's about\nI'm probably going to make a trip over torn before the game on this day and only about one another warning I mean I\nLike those up okay there is business with them uses day coming in um they've just been over the past decade\nSitting atop the subway and golf for you know go to the playoffs have been over the last ten years been into finals national championship games number forty didn't exactly when they come in a on Saturday So they are they are something else\nYeah I there's no doubt there you know there's still a\nThird one of the things in this lake uh you know there's a term with his coach issues right now not I've referred to the ...\nTeams being very which can when we talked about esteem being those which is what we're basically saying is\nIs the teams got

time job that I should get some about February March or April max ... left without the ninth year mhm [noise]\nNo my current income um because I'm an international student I can just work on campus so my current income is about thirty thousand dollars a year and I'm going to lose a job in December because once I graduate I Can't work on campus and I need to find a job and my feet or according to the immigration laws which are photo [laughter]\nI'm I'm In a ... a thousand dollars\nIs that right because I had to pay off my feet and I didn't have money to do that so I just kind of credit card

month but nine hundred dollars a month and I I have two options number one keep on paying the minimum payments which I'm doing\nOr number two different on my ... minutes after April May once I get a full time job I've watched all of your videos and I'm going to make sure I pay off all the ... the credit card I don't believe in um keeping money okay um\nSo I wanted to ask you what the maximum things that can happen when in fact stop paying minimum payments starting to be\nNothing but they won't do anything they won't do anything for a year\nI'm I'm sure that's our best route you can pay

I started listening to it and I think the turning point for me was when I got to the point about the debt snowball and lifting your debt\nBecause up until that point I had been just doing everything they tried to avoid thinking about it it was stressful I just I didn't even want to it you know deal with it and I logged on and I saw that in the past three years I had been pain about Thirteen thousand dollars a year\nAnd about Fifteen thousand dollars a year it was occurring in interest every year so I really wasn't even making a dent in the student loans and so I knew something needed to change I Need to get serious especially being\nIn my late twenties at the time and single I didn't want to have this burden looming over my head for the next decade or two and certainly if I got married and had a family in the future I didn't want to bring that burden into that\nWilliam paid off a ridiculous amount of that with a ridiculously wonderful income show you hum wow okay so you you finished residency\nAnd really about a year went by before you started this right yeah roughly year okay did you come straight out and go into ER yeah yeah Microsoft is an emergency medicine so you were making box already ... but then you just when you shut down to the math on this you went oh I can do this\nYeah I just realized that something absolutely needed a change because I just I couldn't live like that anymore\nWow look at you and just don't mean you just dove in now do you take a lot of extra time at a yard to in order to get the income and this was I wanted to but you know our position makes\nSo I actually went to my boss and asked if I could work all night shift in the ER and I did that for the entire twenties too much pointing months because it paid significantly more to work nights\nYou know is it it's it's ... double isn't a it's about twenty percent more an hour to twenty percent yeah right but wow so you really sacrifice to get this done the people think you were losing your mind I mean your family your doctor your bill enjoy your life I mean yeah the one thing I heard a lot of\nWas in regards to find a new car because I was still driving a used car for medical school at that point like being how\nAre you did it right\nAnd so my friends and family were telling me you know you're crazy you can afford a new car you can afford a car payment and I would tell them\nNo I really just want to save and I'll buy my next door with cash and if I may be a used car and they thought I was not\nYeah well you know you wonder I Know I mean you make foreign fishing doesn't you know I mean pretty much look into this ... story very well done thank you very well done well you did exactly what I Try to get doctors to do\nMost docks come out and go finally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole break in life mhm\nI deserve a new house or a new car I deserve a trip\nAnd they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy understood all you do would you use kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important step that I thought\nYeah 'cause now I mean you make three hundred four hundred and five hundred wherever you make it it's you're going to be unbelievably weapons so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one wow\nThis fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so

their their their goals have come way down because some adults is told them that they're not smart enough or pretty enough there too fat but too skinny or whatever limitation\nThat they did they put

um you know I've got to I've been so blessed to get to see these childhood things come through so many times\nAnd I can't tell you how grateful I Am but the ... to give me as opportunities and I'm
