free scream I Love it how much of your pay it off a hundred and eighty thousand to look at you that's awesome how long does that take six and a half years six and a half years and your range of income during that time\nAnd starting out at a Seventy five thousand and ending around a hundred and sixty thousand\nGood for you you guys are killing it what are you all do for a living I'm a licensed clinical social worker a construction project manager for a interstate retailer uh-huh okay very good well you guys are killing it way to go man like yourself what kind of that was this one hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nA eight thousand was my car and a hundred and Seventy thousand with our wonderful student loans from a private Christian university\nWe were expensive spouses to\nEach other [laughter] oh okay so this you drop some coin men yeah All right and um then six and a half years that's a long time to pay off the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when he told me six years so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually hum when we went through financial piece at our church at the time\nOne of the things that you mentioned in your video\nWas a take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and you said take cash what'd you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and flash the cashing in and talk to them that way so we were at a furniture store and I'm a very non confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took cash in and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad we're trying to buy for our apartment at the time and I'm flashing the cash and saying hey I'm I'm gonna walk if if we can't make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up\nBy the U.S out of that that that is just\nTo show that there is a lot of negotiation from the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we're sitting out with their finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this\nPet feeling in her stomach those were just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nAnd so in the ... started the classy now down a budget and did the ... and we were really on Christmas Day faithful with and ... just really got serious about it and\nAnd I think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really and try to work on maybe step too as we paid by car off a relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first\nPretty big bonus and from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with the money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time where like where we just their budget you know a few months ago and said that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we add\nWhy wouldn't you make a hundred and sixty thought of any debt and our\nFirst and now we have two kids so that makes a lot of kids and your [laughter]\nAt least in some countries that\nYeah that that was the big you know turning point for us and we put that big lump sum of money and our first student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year or so last year the income doubled down right ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct then and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year a kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end the Donald income comes up ... yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this pretty well 'cause six and a half year old and a good\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was\nAnd starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper or to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan and\nI guess she just told the truth I mean it depends on who you're interviewing with as to what they want to hear on something like that but\nI I think you just say I'm you know I don't\nDo well at this this and this and so I'm Better for that that bad\nAnd um\nIt yeah I when I come over here to your organization I Want to be bring I Want to be on my a game I Want to bring you a hundred percent competency\nAnd when I'm outside of my competency it it doesn't indicate a lack of ambition in indicates a lack of self awareness on my part and I'm self aware enough to know that I'm not good at that\nAnd um so that's why I Want to step down I'm not good at this and if that's the truth anyway just tell the truth it's amazing when you do that how it just kinda releases you Eric's with us in Afghanistan often don't get a lot of calls from Afghanistan Eric how are you\n[laughter] pretty is or how you doing better than I deserve your military\nA ... a former military I'm a contractor announcer\nOkay well thank you for your service how can I help today [noise]\nUm Yes sir I'm I have a rental property or doesn't to my primary home that I also rent out [noise] um but I was just notified by my property manager that the house came up on the market or of the house of\n'em that can kind of threw it out the uh there was an inquiry if someone actually wanted to buy the house and now my question was whether I should just sell the house or continue renting it out\nWhere is the house a sin El Paso Texas where's your home\nIs in southern Arizona\nOkay so when you finish contracting in Afghanistan and you live in southern Arizona if you did not on a rental property in El Paso Texas would you go by one\n\nOf what I go by another property if I\nDidn't have the opportunity you know I was in your lead in southern Arizona and you did not have any rental property and you got it ready to buy a rental property I suspect you bite and southern Arizona NATO passionately\nI'm absolutely yeah\nBecause you'd probably have this house left over from being stationed there right\n[noise] um yeah well I bought the house right out I was a right after I got done being stationed in Fort Bliss a I bought a home there then um I moved I ah 'cause it was it was a good deal together they're down VA loan so I took advantage of it which is stupid in hindsight\nYou know ... ... after\nThe reason I Want to sell it is because you wouldn't buy it again\n\nAlso for the same reasons you wouldn't buy it again you wouldn't keep it by the way you can apply that decision making tool to almost anything if you got a boat sitting in the yard that you never used and you look over there and go you're not never buy another boat then so that one\n'cause you don't use you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that's true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if you wouldn't buy it again\nThen don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up the off or whatever but uh dumping I definitely do but\nNot only is in Little Rock Arkansas Hi Natalie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm how do you mean situation here I'm really not sure what you're going to tell me to do but we're working through your plans or the baby swan baby step to I'm paying off that so we only have one thousand dollar emergency pot and and the only thing that we have left to pay off is my car\nWhich I just discovered you recently and six months ago and it was I really needed a new vehicle we did the same thing and buying a brand new car I Do I owe a lot on my car about thirty five thousand dollars good\nLord yeah well I'm about ...\nLess than a week ago I was involved in a pretty big car accident and that cars now total\nOkay luckily we actually bought a GAP insurance to cover the difference between um\nAwesome when you're out awesome but we're a free T\nYeah hey by we only have the one thousand dollar emergency find and I need a new car like yesterday gotcha\nAnd so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and um and you have one car right yes okay what is it\n[noise] it's a two thousand eight yeah I don't know ... ... and strike good\nGood okay they said well All right good [noise] wow uh I'll tell you what I did when I was in the same situation one time\nRented a car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could say five thousand dollars a month yeah probably so and then by five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you save up a bunch more money and get you a Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and pay cash for it\nOK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen okay then drive it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash\nOkay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the option and talked about it or super thrilled about it but we we have a four O. one K. that no\nNo no no money anymore okay we don't borrow money well okay if you borrow money on four oh one K. it's a debt you borrow money\nIs that borrowing it or yeah its borrowing casting if you if\nYou should outlets even worse if you catch it out they're gonna charge you a ten percent penalty plus thirty five percent on your taxes that's a that's borrow money to forty five percent interest effectively to buy buy a car\nAnd I know yeah I did I didn't know that those were the faith yeah it's horrible horrible [noise] no they\nAre ... and lets you got something even sell rot faster gaining so rough fast\nNo not not the evil enough to come back or with\nThe rent the cheapest thing you can rent or are you you're working on some\n[noise] uh no I'm not you're not and I I stay home with my kids okay I've got three kittens so\nOkay how long can you make it without a car\nI Can't make it a day with that [laughter] I really can't get my husband and his hours I'm like where he works and me being home with three kids and having to do all of them to and from school stuff I Can't be without a car I I'm In a rental right now oh\nGood okay what are your what what rental costing\n[laughter] well with my my insurance is covering it right now but I don't know how long the coverage um for probably about another week maybe\nGood good just milk that all the way out right okay and then find you the least expensive rental you can get for one month okay that'll get the job done please don't go rent something super nice\nYeah yeah no [laughter] I'm not in a non paper nice not probably just trying to keep it I've got 'cause networks\nOkay if it's not if it's not super because the more you spend on the road all the less you can say about better car right right but you just need a little five thousand dollar get around van a little mini van just something that runs yeah for just a little walk 'cause you make a ton of money\nYeah and you've been broke for long enough for you to be in broke if you're still being broke this is how to fix it but if you go back and start doing normal people stuff you're gonna be broke again\nYou know normal people do\nThey go by another thirty five thousand dollar

general parents John ... says by the end of the week more than five thousand troops will fanned out across the border\nNow for me to have that mortgage and not a PM I\nAh there had to be a certain amount of equity which I didn't have in cash at the time so my father essentially get it\nMeans so what's your question\nThe question is do I pay back the\nUh the the money to my father because I'm paying him ... I'm saying and be sure\nYou have a second mortgage on your house to hear that you're going to stay on the house you're paid office he asked us you can absolutely and then your parents that first mortgage and then hopefully by then that rental will come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd on your debt frozen uh yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on dude it's not my goal I saw that rental property as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand dollars upside down so well let's wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it to another year or two or whatever and let's get it recovers wants to write a large check to get rid of it I'd rather out a hundred and thirty six dollar check than a what a forty thousand dollar checks all do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling that a tax write off this is not good\nWith money but you didn't set out today that it's just where you ended up by marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it in the meantime pay off your second and pay off your first there we go think Kevin's with us in Denver Hi Kevin how are you\nDoing good how are you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nThings taking my call a two part question I think you know the first part need help on the second part um\nMy dad came to me a couple of years ago and um he was getting ready to retire and want to take a or offered for me to take over a whole life insurance policy forum I think he just kind of looking to get rid of the premiums before he retired [laughter] I Would like to get rid of it now knowing a little bit more about whole life insurance\nBut he keeps telling me I Need to hang on to it mhm and keep it so that when he retired or excuse me when he\nPasses I have money to pay the taxes on ah the inheritance money that will be coming to me and so how long are just as a state\n[noise] uh I Would say it's\nClose to a million there's no taxes on his estate\nSo he didn't know what he's talking on taxes on no\nYou don't have the ... there's no tax federal there is no federal estate tax on the states over a ... unless they're over five points for nine million this year\n[laughter] okay so everything like so all hit so he's he is can I think he's converting most like his raw than it is for only caves and all those things so\nIf it was a state is one million dollars there's no taxes on the\nPhone pay any taxes on any of it\nNow you might pay a state probate tax but there's no federal estate taxes on in the state of one million dollars\nNot see we're okay there will\nHave over five million dollars for the fence to get after you show so he he's got you know what he's doing he's territory in the back what the idiot whole life agent told him that sold in this\nYou need to keep their costs every state tax planning\nAnd and he's been hearing that since you were born and so he's a leading those same words back out like a\nParrot and the cage okay but I don't know what he's talking about okay and neither did the whole I imagine for that matter\nBut if the okay well I'll just say okay and so as far as like a conversation with him about that because when he gave it to be obviously had some value is worth about eight thousand\nNow we're down see I

studios\n[noise] they\nFrom Dutch to George right here in the lobby of Ramsey solutions Hi Dale how are you\nI'm doing great thanks Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nAh well I had an unusual question and I've been pondering it for a while\nI'm after my divorce I moved to a guest and started working and I moved in with friends in their garage apartment mhm so I have use of kitchens restroom and laundry on normally think she would renting a room um [noise]\nBut I came across a condo that I'm Wondering the realtors own and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five Seventy ... and ... and was rented [noise] when I bought it and a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month and\nI my rent where I Am is only five hundred and this one's going to be available for the end of the year and I've been wondering do I want to move into it make it my own home now that it's making\nMe show you bought it and it's rented right okay and what's your income a average about thirty five thousand a year commissions\nMhm okay well I ... the way I answer questions what always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um what feels good in the short term might not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd uh so uh when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which these decisions takes me there okay now obviously you can live in a garage apartment how old are you\nI'm not fifty five okay and you can live in a garage apartment or your sixty five and you could make the transactional spread here um make an extra some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you the question you ask yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can increase my income during the next ten years and be living in a condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really was an ... it's kind of camping oh when you're not a college student [laughter] I mean this was camping that's right you know and so this isn't like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because of the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you feel and you've settled you've got your found footing under you again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a condo um probably moving into their condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now like Seventy thousand understood the thirty five and what trick them on their what am I going to do to get my support a healing as believing in yourself again at away ... are are blaming yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut er ... if that's where you are that's where your head is I think I'm going to move into the condo now if you're headed is saying you know I think I'm probably going to the solemn ever going to do I'm just going to route thirty five thousand into retirement\nYou might want to grow department or the other money in your pocket but I don't think that you\nI'm not really like to purchase a house you know keep the condo is rental income now well let's get it paid off is paid off oh good that'd be awesome them you will by if you got extra money to about beyond Tobias worth\nSaving not at the moment not OK than living in a condo with no payment at all\nYou know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that go faster so I'm I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh I'm back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back\nYeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my income going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm I'm not going camping anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now your back\nIs that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Claire our you\nKnow I'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you with all your data set for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on a head on retirement but we're behind on college savings for two kids so how old are your kids you\nNow if that doesn't hit you in the fields I don't know what the us to watch people going about their business mostly trucks\nBut many vans and a passenger cars as well but to watch people pull off to the side of the road\nAnd take their head off some of them looking down to show respect for somebody that they didn't even know to the family members who were passing by\nTo take I don't know how long the procession was had to be at least five minutes most people have so convinced themselves that they're running late to life that\nEverything has to be driving up on somebody's ass trying to drive over I'm trying to whip through traffic an endangered children in the process as if that makes it tough I've heard that one\nOf them told ... mind you know it'll kill from kids great that's well that's that's fantastic but anyway everybody's\nIn a rush and to see people stop like that for a moment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Beaumant", "day": "30"}
