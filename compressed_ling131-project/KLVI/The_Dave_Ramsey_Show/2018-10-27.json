champions built literally the world the world while watching people presented to them by the wrestlers and we're real excited about that it'd be a lot of fun\nAnd my buddy Jared Wayne from the pope patrol from hurricane per wrestling was on the air here a couple of times and it's going to be a great program it's all about stew reading those kids you know and helping them learn about Christ's love and that they feel a purpose and we really do believe in wildlife conservation\nI'm tired of people being like well the next generation he's gonna be the one helping were making that people\nWe
