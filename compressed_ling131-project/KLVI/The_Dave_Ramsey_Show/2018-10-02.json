along the way you're going to head he's kind of pull three for you there on your side\nOkay All right well I mean if you're saving you know if you're spending twenty percent of that plus or minus our house payment you are going to have a lot of money when you put the calculator from forty to sixty five is twenty five years of savings or his money and we're talking about saving you know Fifteen twenty grand a year\nWhich I can do that you know you you know okay and then\nAt my age or my four oh one K. do I want for all wars on my ...\nYes you want to get a tax break for sure\nPoker on the

to stay out of there for one k.'s and miss it for very long but you've got a big goal here and they're big goal is to not ever have a house\nAnd you know what that does is if you turn that money into investing rather than consumption meaning you don't blow out by ... every month you invested instead than the answer is you know you haven't you haven't waited too long you're fine but if you turn around by something with it every month and you and your consume at all\nThen you may have in your only want to put Fifteen Percent aside than you might be might be making them stay clear\nTiffany's in Baltimore, Maryland Tiffany welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello hey what's up I'm\nCalling because I'm trying to decide if I Want to file bankruptcy Annette\nHow much that I Am and I'm the one now than what kind of did as a\nLoan and credit cards I had a major medical several major medical issue happened mhm and I had it developed in place and the company is fighting the image than a year and a half and he still hasn't given me my money and I wouldn't be in that situation and um and then it any more money\nMhm [noise] um so I just got a lawyer and um it is writing letters basically right now 'cause I Can't afford to get really want to do like prepaid legal mhm\nAnd so that the situation um and and it's really hard because of all we have had things in place and all\nAre you currently disabled and I am\nWhich the editor of an hour west of the nature of your disability\nIs a federal thing going on right now several medical issues so fiber around and it found out I just had attempt on August twenty twenty and that's how I handled the condition [noise] Mm\nWell so what kind of up is the fifty one doesn't usually credit cards I'm not sure which critical edge\n[noise] um [noise] and um\n...\nMost of it a credit card and and I had her alone so for one credit card company it started out and they just sent me a letter and if I paid on ... and they would you know going all in the mall and the animals the hardship to have a lower how much I\nDon't know what I'm doing good for them blow it you don't have the money\nWell a lot harder to\nCome out with them but it's still not enough [noise] [noise]\nOh well that's part of the picture when what does he make\nAbout twenty eight now and in that much because he lost his job when I first got her mhm um when I first got\nHer are you not and you're still young long receiving disability\nNo I'm a clown I'm a short time we had an economy dropped off for a permanent disability to say but I'm In and out of work so much that now going to be really really low is not even want to be when I cook it because you know it goes on her credit than in and out in and out of where\nI'm at this point I Want to know the lawyer so I'm trying to find out he said he can't really tell me much until they go in and see if I should do is having on it I could do with that and whatever team\nAnd then if I did at Thirteen he didn't know how much they were going to pay that they want to get it out figure that out\nAnd then I might have to wind up paying I mean you know they'll only and that money I don't understand\nYou gave him a clean a hundred dollars to file bankruptcy or give them anything oh I don't get anything so you're not paying on these credit cards or these loans to the right\nNow not right now on on that and we're\n... we're going to be look let's pretend you're just didn't pay those loans for a year\nAnd they just sit there the worst cases which you're right yeah and what are they going to get you don't have anything you don't have an income and you don't have the assets they can do you own something as valuable\nWell I yeah I own a home that living at home and I looked at the equity and I have um I have about eight hours a day and now I Can't sell the house though because if I tried to tell ... what is that algae either go market yourself\nAnd then it because they're selling how are you like sixty Seventy down now let me you know I'm an area that how are you all for like one of a like a hundred and fifty thousand mhm but\nWhy can't you sell your home a lot of them in the area that are headed again\nWhy can't you know your house\nAnd one of the doubt and I don't live in a one on speaking out and about two thousand and why why can't you sell it because you have a lot of foreclosures and I think more than one sixty and you are what\nUm own Ninety eight\nOkay show show it and get out much you can out of it and pay somebody will\nPay off my dad with that\nYeah definitely for you go bankrupt and when you file bankruptcy they don't let you keep investment property with equity and then not pay your bills bankruptcy law works\nSo the Trump bankruptcy trustee will force the sale of that property and it'll be forced to be paid against your bills and I think you can get enough out of that to go to each one of these and you can probably settle fifty thousand in your situation for around thirty five if you negotiate with them but you need the money in your hand to do that and you don't have any money\nSo this is the way to get those all cleared up and then in the process of course we've got to figure out how to get your income back up and get your household income working again 'cause that's the root cause of all of this ...\nBeen so long term where are you going to be in two years where are you going to be in a year where are you going to be in three years which are long term game plan and what are you doing about getting there that's got to be your next step because you've got to get either disability income coming in um you know if you're the workers' comp if if you were hurt you said on the job or you or I can tell from what you're saying that which way it was but\nYou know any money that is do you or any money you can create you used to create your future kiddo\nAnd that's what we want you to do we want you to have a future\nAnd and so you start looking out there in the into the future and saying how am I going to take the next step is to get there but as far as filing bankruptcy I don't think that's going to be advantageous to you when you got this much older when you've got this much equity in a property and I think you can clear up the debt by selling it\nSelling it taking the equity using that money that thirty thirty five thousand dollars it's they're forty thousand whenever you get out of it\nAnd subtle at fifty one thousand deaths by negotiating with get that in writing before you send them any money but I think you can work your way through this to fall by ruptured be one finally there's I'm like you sold the house or your way [noise]\nSuppose this hour of the day Ramsey showing the bugs our thanks to James

that's the problem she likes and money mhm\nMhm and how old are you\nI'm Eighteen okay All right\nWell there's a rule that we have discovered in these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother's not going to take an Eighteen year olds input\nOn her spending habits you don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering am I wrong\nNo you're not wrong at all\nYou know it's just difficult now you know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you that there was a couple things um\nOne is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend and do this and I used to do this and man when I got on this budget I got on this humble up system I got on this plan to get out of that I'm doing so good and you just tell your story\nIs your story is not condemning her\nIt's just lose just holding up the idea that there's hope right\nYeah I Do tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad who could sit down and talk with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually yes my dad has talked to her he's actually one of the people that we should call and we don't watch your show\nMhm okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny ah this would be like a husband now calling now that's a little different standing and he puts his arm around his wife and says look we got a problem here you're spending like you're in Congress I mean we got to stop this there's a problem here\nAnd when you sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life and we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save\nShow that we have to live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you wrote 'cause you're he's got standing he's got\nPosition in the household to have a discussion where as an Eighteen year old you don't and um it's not just you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not home or whatever I'm just saying your mom's eyes you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing\nAnd um you know he can sit down and if it was a mile from the Chernobyl to shut down when I have a discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there's a problem and we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a
