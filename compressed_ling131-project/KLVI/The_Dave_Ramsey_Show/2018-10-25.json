a quick\nQuestion um I I have a plan I'm from I'm I'm a\nRetirement from a job that I had ten years ago and I left the money in their arm is about twenty seven thousand dollars [laughter] and and I'm growing at an ancient trade a five percent annual and I was going to leave it there until I retired but I can retire\nAt sixty two which is I can I'm Seventeen years [laughter]\nBut I did the math and it's only gonna be sixty three thousand dollars by the time I turn to take the kid I take that money out and um [noise]\nI I guess part of the house the two Seventy five when they tell you loan so Mali note on that it's like Eighteen hundred should I take that money out and refinance I can get a lower mortgage and then same them different from the market when I'm no\nI Would roll it to an IRA and pick out some good growth stock mutual funds that have long track records of ten years or more you should be able to make twice what you're making all this money\nOkay north of ten percent most of my mutual funds of average though we're ... percent\nAnd you can pick mutual funds that have done that a by getting with a good investment advisor that teaches you you have to get someone with the heart of a teacher you don't just do something because they said do it or because somebody in the suits and do it which you sit down with them you learn how that works and you put it in good\nTo all funds into an IRA roll over from that money the way to find somebody to help you do that I'm not in that business but we have a group of people we recommend you can click on smart faster\nAt Dave Ramsey dot com and you put in your information it drops down a list of the smart investor prose the people that we recommend in your area and then you can select from among them and um shut down with one of them and they'll talk to you and teach you and take your time learn about this\nGet comfortable with the idea but I think you can make a lot more on this money then you're making on it now and if you just pull it out you're going to get hammered on taxes and penalties for that matter [noise] Emily is with us in Detroit Hi Emily welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow they think how much you're taking my call sure how can I help so I have a question not as much right south but\nFrom my parents my husband and I were introduced to SPA and\nAbsolutely love that and we are just because they can to and we have a longer plan with a whole bunch of student loans that were just trying to well and it's how they're going to take a few years and I did see my parents thinking and that's horrible kind of despair\nAnd being completely broke and overwhelmed and that's where things are happening at the end so I just calling for advice on how how I can influence them because they really like advice from their can even though I in my thirties now it doesn't matter it's like I'm Still okay\nIt's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder dry but they don't really want your opinion\nAbout rank about money or sex okay and so the only time that reverses when they get really really really old and as I pointed out I'll get yeah but um that you generally doesn't happen and so you know it's like a friend that's being obstinate\nBecause you're both grown people you're grown your parents are grown\nAnd they're being obstinate about something and you just have to watch somebody that you love do self destructive stupid things like I've got a friend that's an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself if he doesn't go drinking\nI mean you know I ... and I've talked to him people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff to kill themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's anyone that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility the probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were ... mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and put man I feel so much better and I'm On the way and no one\nAnd if you do have to go heavy on somebody a little bit uh just blame it on me doing a ... you just said ... okay and just go you know you can argue with David you argue a day but you know he got me bought it that I don't think you did sure\nSo um you know whatever it may not be that abrasive but you know what I can write but the point is you can good guys bad guys they call it off on me and lean on that and so\nLike when retro cruise first start speaking um I mean she was twenty four years old and I'm like her what she thought sure [laughter] now she's twenty eight and had three ... three ... national bestsellers and now a few people cares what you're right but she just blame it on me\nOr if we're in a Christian setting we buy it on the Bible okay you know this is what the Bible says right [laughter] the Bible says the bar rich life but the lender and you won't argue with that how you got yeah and the Bible you know Jesus said don't build a power without first counting the costs less to get halfway up and you know what I mean ... obviously you begin to mark you and say this men began to build and was unable to finish\nSo you should be on a written plan is what Jesus was saying so\nReally I mean I get up on him I mean you know a ... that kind of stop now again I'm being kind of sarcastic and bombastic he would be I Would even be more gentle than that in a setting in a smaller setting up\nThe bigger the setting the more wild I Am about the uh but you know when you're one on one you're just gentle and you just go guys I'm only thirty one I don't have all the answers but here's what we did know and you know if you want to have those same results I suspect it'd be do the same thing we did\nYou'd have the same results we didn't have those results because of our age we had those results because we applied proven principles right you know I mean let's let's say that you are leading up let's say you were a personal trainer\nAnd the guy you were training or was four hundred pounds\nAnd he was a forty five years old\nBut he doesn't like you're telling him anything God you're thirty one and you have I have\nI mean come on you know it was a personal trainer you got out she got up so yeah so I mean he may have he's got to ... you know you just you just kind of this is what you're doing ... my point is you approve but but you just approach it with the same spirit you approach this question wealth okay and that's just a a level of humility um but you can be\nForceful on the principles\nAnd on the scripture as the backup for the principles and even on the day Ramsey or Dave Ramsey organization or brand or whatever as proof of the principles and your personal life is proof of the principles and if they don't get it through all of that because you're thirty one they're just using that as an excuse\nBut again you don't want to be abrasive but you're not going to be you wouldn't even asked this question if you were going to be a brace right and it's just not your style it's who you guys are okay but do really you've got great story\nThank you and just tell your story yes this is what we did I mean you do what you want it but this is what we do right and and look what happened you know I lost three hundred pounds of if you do the set up to donate to smooth is what happens you know and it's applied the principals and as I say thank you so much for teaching a class no thank you so cool that you're doing that yeah I'm excited and you know what's what's yours\nAll right is interesting is that people don't look down on age when there are results mhm okay it's when you have no proof\nIn your life or you know that that you you know that they look down and they go look I got socks older than you\nYou know and they ... they will but but that's what you got us or you're they wish they had been when they were thirty right you know and and so they can still be that when they're sixty if they'll go do it ... thanks for joining us thanks for coming by and thanks for taking the class Haley is with us in Seattle, Washington Hi Hailey how are you\nToday I'm Glad I have um a question concerning a pension plan mhm [noise] so\nUm I have I'm forty four thousand from a previous employer in a retirement plan and I know you talk about pulling it out and putting it or not pulling it out but transferring from Utah fun good so I went to a guy in our church and he worked for private financial and he does say that he college jail\nAnd and so I um\nI I Need the enemy as well he was I felt that we put money into variable annuity rather than mutual funds and I wasn't sure why or if that was okay or fat but you're following\nYou and I did not following you know what is not following what I teach um I I didn't think about\nThe answer to that part of the question variable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of an annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment in the ... is a coat that goes around the investment to keep it warm from Texas\nOkay\nOkay and you pay extra for\nThe annuity portion of this discussion now\nWhat you can buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without the new to cope wrapping around them okay\nSo what is the new the coke do for you the coat wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's been an IRA already Dutch so you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you got it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay and then you move it into a new the inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity will give us they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds when you're young you don't need those guarantees\nShow I'm OK and truthfully not not trashing thrive in I mean driving her friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual fund sale\nIs there's two things going on usually usually if someone's trying to show you that because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that which way they can make such a way\nIn insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities large\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thriving is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a verbal and earlier about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people ... just because they make more on them\nAnd I would not accused the chicken or guy of that and the situation I mean knowing his from knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not security ... that's my guess okay and in the early years and years and he still giving you a bad recommendation\nNow he did say that I can do that and you will find exactly as you recommend them has using him he just really pushing the variable annuity and asked\nMe to go home with all the numbers at my husband review and think about that but I wanted to call you immediately and I knew what you are going to stay already\nYou know so now we've got another problem OK okay if this piece of advice was bad and you knew it what about the next ... by that you don't know it was bad\nI you're right that I'm ...
