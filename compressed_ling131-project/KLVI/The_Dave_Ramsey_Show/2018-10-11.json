with us Hi Elle how are you Hi Dave I'm good how are you doing that as\nMorning we'll do I live here in Nashville I'm originally from Kansas so okay well welcome to hand in\nThe ... yes I Am Lovett much replied off I paid off sixty thousand or how long the district it took me about three years okay and your range of income during that time\nI started out at fifty thousand and then I'm In like the mid seventies I picked up a second job towards the end of my baby step to sell it for a living I'm an accountant I'm a CPA go watch certain drugs\nSo I kinda just at a part time thing at the YMCA didn't earn a lot but it kept me out of trouble it kept me out of the stores rubble targeting can get in trouble yeah target gets\nMe in trouble [laughter] oh buck I Would draw yeah walls or what kind of that was the sixty thousand it was all student loans or what your degree in\nSo all accounting I got my undergrad and master's degree\nIn accounting degree which obviously such a re should be some actual actual excellent show up at three years ago so when you go to school\nYes so I graduated and and you know when you graduate they require that you do exit counseling with your financial aid and as terrible as it sounds I didn't really know what that final number was going to be so I was kind of just doing my exit counseling\nHoping for the best and I saw how much I owed and it was terrifying\nBecause I knew what my starting salary was going to be and I owed more than my one year's salary and so I saw that and I saw my monthly payments and then I saw all these different payment plans and you know I'm an accounting\nSo I knew the interest was going to add up quickly and yeah it was just it was very scary but I knew about the baby steps so I just decided that's the route I was going to take poker show were journal about the register for him\nSo I actually listen to the Dave Ramsey show when I was like in junior high and high school age and\nYour mind that will kind\nOf um so my dad is a farmer in Kansas fan in the summertime I Would drive tractor and combine and all you have out in the fields is the radio I didn't even have a cell phone back then and so um you know I Would listen to FM radio and you learn quickly that they play the same songs over and over again\nSo then I learned about a man and I could switch to a and and listening to talk radio so um you know I listen to us in in the morning and then I switched to the Dave Ramsey show from one to for a nice little three hour break and listening to talk radio and then switch back to us and so it was just a nice nice little break in the day\nI have a strange movie version though combine yes this is in our house yup tuning in the rodeos you're out here ah getting getting some a picture of it yesterday was that we yes\nMy dad's a wheat farmer I Hope so yeah we would drive combine and cut the wheat and you know after that we'd have to work the Philo young does your robot combined by yourself I Would probably say like twelve or Thirteen million something like that yeah I have two older sisters and they did the same thing so yeah\nYou learn a lot of work do you have to grow up on a formula or not or yes are you are not a drop early [laughter] very cool orange juice was drilled in your head come over counting you get the degree you look up to what we're doing so might be stuff so I got her ... from the radio then what happened\nAnd uh well I just jumped right into it I so I went to Kansas State university I moved to Kansas City so it took me a couple of months to get established but then\nI jumped right in and I started paying off my debt and then I kind of hit a little bit of a bump in the road about a year into the process I was in a motorcycle accident and so I had to hit pause on the baby steps for about six to eight months and I just paid the minimum wage then um and then I picked it back up and was able to pay everything off but\nYou know I'm so thankful that I was working your plan because I mean I probably wouldn't have had an emergency fund in place and that was\nSo important that I had that it was so helpful to me and made this terrible situation that I was in um so much more manageable so I'm just so grateful that I followed the plan and had that set aside you know it's very important\nTo many vehicles in the store called ... I had no remote [laughter] exactly good for you yeah so how does it feel now that you did this\nIt feels amazing it's it's the best feeling\nIn the world ... I'm twenty eight twenty another one of these rockstar millennials are all the time very well done very cool so um you talk to your dad and your mom you were doing all this stuff yes\nI did I talked about the plan constantly I was probably annoying throughout the process just talking about Dave Ramsey [laughter] but yes I've everyone kind of been in on the loop John who is your biggest cheerleader [noise] um [noise] probably my sisters\nThey absolutely ended up paying everything whenever the divorce like he was making about a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year and a wide\nAs you know like that now\nWe are what are the answer though and I can and we\nHe lost his job I lost my job um and so he's gotten that he worked in the plant it gotten back to working at but he had to go with a different company and they offered him five dollars an hour ...\nOne of the other company never reopen right and what does he do\nHe works um he's a traitor and the plant here in Louisiana\nHuh ... work in a ...\nI Would ... the other part of the story I Want to get straight in my head it sounded like you didn't know how much did he had until after you were engaged\nYeah why I I was not aware I was not very smart and I did not come about that I'd never had that it didn't cross my mind was should across is\nThat you should have had this information prior to a making a commitment to marriage\nYes that's kind of a problem like he was hiding it okay and that bothers me more than the debt at this moment um and so what's his attitude about the debt\nUm he really hasn't been hanging thanks for that and I just don't want to start America now that I Know about the guy I can accept that I just before we actually set a date to get married I ... I Know that we are on a plan to get paid off\nThere you go and that he believes in that plan and is committed fully to that plan if he if he is for whatever reason\nHas has given up hope and it feels like he's stuck you're just going to stay there or he just doesn't care or whatever about the debt if for whatever reason he's just going to wallow in this\nThat's a deal breaker okay it's not the bet\nI wouldn't tell you the not marry him over the debt but I Will tell you to not marry him over lying about it or not marry him over uh the fact that he wants to just stay in it because you're not going to be you know you you it's a long life ... hill for you\nOkay if you think about ten years Fifteen Years from now you're still wall and the stuff you're not going to be okay with that\nNo that's what I absolutely don't want to do you know\nAnd so as long you know and if he's not going to be all in like we live on nothing and I'm you know he probably just go back to court and adjust\nSome stuff and um\nAnd I don't think he owes forty five thousand dollars on the ... I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they reported Eli\nFalcon he owed when they go to Seventy thousand yeah what was the driving than what I think it's absolutely outrageous [noise]\nUh yeah any Roald some negative equity into that to get the ... and ... and so the the forty five thousand is the difference go they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar really probably sell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do with that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] while a\nMight be able to settle those would lump sum I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you've got to put some money together here and that means both of you were going to get your incomes up and you both have to buy I desire to get\nOut of money or to get out of debt and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you guys just go bananas it's going to take you a few years so um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not get married over the decision to stay in that when you don't want to say that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not going to last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nGuess what you're going to get divorced I mean that's just as a fairly simple equation here and so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not keeper I don't know if he's a keeper not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers\nAnd all that but because he got his ...\nBut um anyway [noise]\nMan he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\n[laughter] off a lot of four that's good gosh so oh wow\nYeah somebody so anyway yeah ... this was not an equitable outcome I have no idea what the situation was but wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that behind us now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go game all that's fine thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Alex is in Pittsburgh hey Alex our you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] very good hey we are newly married and looking to create a plan forward good so yep newly a newly came onto your videos on YouTube so I'm as I'm going through it looks like we are on step six word to free we of six months of a savings\nBoth put about Fifteen or Seventeen percent into four one K. wow a new\nOne out or ... or plan that you've already done all of it [laughter] yeah it doesn't happen all the time really really good for you okay so what's your question\nUm yeah no kidding oh college fund so it's kind of like we're on step six out of about ... ... mortgages are only to okay\nI Know and with that we have about Fifteen thousand extra on savings on top of our six month emergency fund her answer the question is a story about forty eight on the house is worth about a hundred mhm um and it isn't a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with that fourteen or Fifteen extra grand do we use that to start paying off the mortgage more right now I Do double payments so we're already actively trying to pay that off quicker but do we [noise]\nWe commit to paying off house early or do we split it and keep keep doing the uh paying down of the mortgage and poking up for a um a down payment knowing that I don't want to\nI Love real estate and if you have a desire to home run a roast that I really want you to get there I Do not personally buy real estate was that for investment and I don't tell people to mind ... real estate with that effort and\nSo you borrowing money to buy your next house meanwhile keeping a paid for rental is the same thing is borrowing money to buy a rental and the fact of life so you're not going to take my answer but I Would tell you sell the rental and by your next house we're excesses paid off and save up your money in cash [noise]\nThat would be maybe step seven issue for the call so this is Dave

com slash Ramsey that question is ah from Jessie now in New Jersey they were having a very hard time trying to get on track with everything including starting our emergency fund\nWhat can we do when we are so behind that we can not even catch up for about two months behind on all bills it's causing a lot of stress on our marriage or kids were tired of living this way but we feel like we're in so much debt in so deep that we can't get out\nYeah just saying I gets really really scary when you're in a situation like that and um [noise] part of what's scary is the sense that you're stuck part of what's scary is you're overwhelmed\nAnd um\nLet's stop and pull one segment out of this thing and talk about that for a second or two months behind on our bills and it's causing us so much stress on our marriage and the\nKids being behind on your bill should not affect your kids\nThey should know about it you don't need to tell your five year old or behind on the lights that's not their problem much your problem\nAnd you can tell the kids know but you don't have to give him a big long reason why knows a complete sentence [noise] no but don't pass off the uh you know don't pass off the stress of the kids\nNow let's look at the rest of this what do you do when you're completely overwhelmed and terrified and feel stuck I've been there some y'all know what I'm Talking about you've been there to do\nIt is no fun OK here's how you fix it\nYou have to begin to take control of what you can take control of you have an income let's make sure that that first is being controlled and that's called the budget\nNow you do not have to be able to pay everything to do a budget all a budget is as you're telling the money that you do have where it is going to go\nAnd so when you can't pay everything which catching everything up and one month would be paying everything right\nWhen you can't pay everything then you've got to say well the money that we have we're going to do the most we can do with that and for this month that's all we can do\nSo you prioritize you make enough to buy food you do not make enough to eat out so we're not going to restaurants but we are going to the grocery store and we're going to feed our family and we're going to cook from scratch 'cause it's healthier and it costs less\nSo there we go do you make enough to do that check but that one down for the food budget downright that number down and you can do that\nYou make enough to pay your lights and water and if you're behind on them you catch them all up this month before you do anything else after you ate ... current on your lights get current on your water now if you have\nA six hundred dollar a month cable bill because you have NFL super duper pooper scooper or whatever then cancel all that crap but I'm Talking about water and the lights\nAnd gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lots of water on\nAnd gas to heat if it's gas heat\nOkay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities\nMake enough to do that and get current on them right now\nNumber three is shelter now you pay your rent it doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there is no heat so you gotta put heat in the place okay so you pay your rent if you're behind on your rent before you move on to number for you catch up on your rent\nNumber for transportation\nYour current on the car and you keep gas in the car now if that takes all your money and you can pay nothing else this month old well\nThe catcher in sub chapter and had a game at school or play or something and David work at home one of the state of tell them and the other went to ... so you know I think I have one regret in
