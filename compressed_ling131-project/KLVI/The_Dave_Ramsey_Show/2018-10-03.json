I mean I I ... I don't tell people to buy a home when they're in that okay so if you call me how to time I was told you to buy but this house has not like you know if you call me up you're making thirty eight hundred dollars your house payments Fifteen hundred dollars and I we got a problem\nI'm going to put that house on the market but your house payment is way less than a force of your take on pay\nAnd so you're fine I mean it's really not your problem I think you guys are just starting to budget and uh the emotional weight of\nA a of dealing with the medical situation you're facing and what your with your baby I mean when you're babies' heart and it just that's just it just wears you down you know it just makes you human her makes you a good daddy and a good mommy\nBut according to the truth is it makes it kind of hard to see past ah I'm just looking at the ... numbers right now I don't ... I mean I I feel for you guys are pray for you but I don't have the emotional weight that you guys have got facing the stuff you face every day dealing with this situation you know so\nThat's just very real a ... but but the math actually you know thirty eight hundred bucks minus nine hundred dollars minus a eight hundred dollars for a house payment\nOr you know minus ... minus ... minus water doesn't leave a lot of room but you could pay your payments on everything doing that and then you can pick up your overtime and start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little that's clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're going to start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I think that's the you're just you know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of clouding it's this is doable though where are you are is doable I I think you can pull it off no I Would not show your\nI Would not about it because I don't ... to buy a house where we got that but\nIt's your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like what are you crazy none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nOr for your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you're dead gum rotted would clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster so are you have you got a couple of years are really hard work and lots of overtime inside jobs ahead of you yup you sure do\nAre you guys gonna be taking a bunch of fans who vacations new you got a bunch of that you're cleaning it up at your reality but hold on I'll have Kelly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to ya and\nHelp get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can I'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how are you doing Dave better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nNot too much I've got a question for you on baby steps which is pay off my house early [noise] um [noise] I don't have any other debt inside my house I have a six month emergency fun\nUm but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um [noise] I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual funds and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to\nUm take a hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment cook at all for the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment from my house\n... what's your household income uh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand so you could be like debt free and when you were if you did this\nUh um yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nOr if your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments what'd you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments\nKnow same thing in a\nUm I don't follow okay well\nI mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out of the investment in order to put in and pay off your home\nThat's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing is if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing is borrowing on your home to invest isn't it got it\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the major liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch them back and forth by borrowing money\nMeaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you got that over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the page now you'd have an investment right and all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of ...\nAh the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do yeah and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house degrading investment is absurd and your mind\nYeah I mean you immediately reacted but that's a heart thing see that's a that's a risk bart that ... that you're measuring this cause you to do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and went crazy in your mind right you know\nAnd that that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes I Do the hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume this was not in a retirement account no penalties right\n[noise] [noise] uh no that that hundred thousand is just going back right yeah it always say is I mean you're talking about the head and the heart or just with\nThe mathematics of it ... if you leave ... by if you put risk in the mathematics of it and it changes the mathematics and so and and so your\nHeart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measured amount\nAnd so yes I take the money out of their house I'll be done for in a year she's actually what I Know\nThe guy just Blake

percentage\nWhat we tell folks and after you is to not take anything more than a fourth of your take home pay right gotcha how can they survive but more than that yeah they can survive it more than that and again I Want to hear the story around the income you know they just started the job and you know maybe their incomes going to be going up dramatically in the next two years\nAnd so I have I have that they're protective tenants and the honor roll and I have a sixty five hundred dollar per month terrified income and then I have on the high end ... at twelve thousand wow I'm terrified income and um\nSo I Am kind of leaning towards that the higher income with no pets yeah birthday that the lower income just for our security yeah\nI mean I I ... and again if that's if they don't have an eight hundred dollar car payment or something I got to know what else was in the mix the whole story but all things being equal\nYeah that's the direction I Want to see that they've got the room the ability and they're not going to be tackled from behind and then you just talking to them and ask for training have they really learn their lesson and nobody really turned the corner heading back

anything\nBut um I mean there's a rule when your landlord ... that's a ten thousand dollar cap\nBecause that's what it's going to devalue your house\nBecause you can't get kept pay out of a house you

... ... and\n... you know I don't have animals or what you people that go control your animals and let them do to my house that's what I\nAnd so that's why I don't know pet pet policy 'cause sometimes

and they are not to have their word taken for anything\nYeah she she had all those over once she's interviewed again\nBy the FBI yeah\nWe're good we're good we're going to go ahead and cast a vote because at this point this has become ridiculous\nWe've reached that point where it's time to call the room to order cast a vote and move on and that's nonsense we've have you ever been to a public meeting I served on city council for six years and I'm going to tell you there are times when you get these groups it'll come forward\nIt's usually some activist group and they come forward and you know they're nuts when they first walk in the door there was one group that used to come in and had his old black lady they were\nKind of a they were kind of a nation of Islam come black lives matter come are\nAngry at the world come ... group and they had this old woman and she'd come ... she'd she'd\nCome in and uh she where like this ...\nAnd it had buttons on it and the buttons were just crazy nutty like every Salo Lenski group every now mind you this was before the Soros influence things have things have really taken a turn for the worse\nIn the ten years since I left public life since I left being elected official\nBut she would come every time and she would carry\nA file folders and I I don't know what was in her file folders but it was a bunch of documents that were kind of bent and I don't know ...\nMaybe it was the Warren Commission report on the Kennedy assassination and maybe some notes from Charlotte Maine\nAnd you know a couple of ah edicts I'm\nFrom the council of elders maybe the ... of berms meant to you know as a tack\nCold at the top a British she would come forward and\nThey would come to city council meetings every time they were ready for you know a a vote on reparations or something\nAnd they would come rolling in in a group and their whole do you remember ... pen on a peanut member pick being carried with him at ... ... there was like a dust storm that would come with him [noise] that's\nWhat this was there was a there was a smell of ... the body odor and stink and oils\nAnd I'm I'm\nA what do you call the ... that that people light um incense and so there there was this combination can a hippie smell\nA which was not pleasing to my nose it's what I imagine Woodstock smelled like um and and so\nAnd and maybe you know eight year old clothes cigarettes just bundled in that\nAnd they would come rolling in to the chambers and we'd be in the middle of our meeting and they would begin to disrupt\nAnd we did not have the disposition\nTo simply have them removed and continue with our meeting so what would happen is they would come in and they weren't sure how much they could get away with\nSo when they come in they were real loud and boisterous as they came in but they were somewhat subdued\nAnd the longer they were there\nThey would begin it was like a conductor with his hands toward the sky and lifting the volume up right and and they would they would begin and so this hall the city council was you know at that point was Ninety years old building was built in late twenties was one of these great\nOld halls Houston city hall it was it was a ... it's a feat of of architecture it's a beautiful building but it has these real tall ceilings and they're marble\nOn the walls and granted and so sound just bounces off of there and they would be so loud it would start it would be disruptive to the meeting\nBut nobody understood we had all shown up to have a city council meeting and vote and move on well this group's job was not they didn't get a vote they didn't have points they wanted to make they were there to disrupt and that meant screaming", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show",
