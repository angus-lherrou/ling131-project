bones of relating to five uh five two to five [noise]\nJake's on Facebook [noise]\nFollow me there ... dot com slash Dave Ramsey and you'll get part of the messages we put on their Facebook does not\nEverything through the throttle are messages so they can make us by ads from well it doesn't really work that way guys but I Try anyway he says what's the difference between a credit union and the bank\nA bank is owned by stock holders\nThat when the bank makes a profit and they should make a profit we want them to make some profit when the bank makes a profit the stock holders the owners of the company\nYet that profit basically I mean it is the profits dispersed in the form of um dividends or the value of the stock has increased because the bank continue ... whatever it is but basically the owners of a bank are stockholders and that's where the profit goes\nA credit union is operated more like a cooperative\nWhere the owners of a credit union are there it's actually not for profit technically speaking and um the not the owners of the credit union are the credit union members which are also the customers\nAnd so as a customer of the credit union those services in interest rates and whatever you pay the credit union they profit that has created\nIs returned to their members in the form of increase services or in the form of actual dispersed much\nI mean sometimes you actually get a little check from your credit and put into your account and so uh that's the difference uh banks don't don't offer banks don't like credit union as they say they have an unfair advantage\nBecause there have nonprofit status I'm more or less really not true\nI'm it's real simple the credit union simply does not make a profit because whatever proper this may just fall back into cheaper checking accounts better interest rates on loans or higher interest rates on savings\nAnd so the you know basically they end up not making a profit so if a bank wanted to uh make less profit could do the same thing\nSo they don't have a disadvantage they're just trying to keep stock holders happy and sell stuff to customers the credit union has customers that are the stock holders other sense the owners are the members and so it returns and all of that really doesn't matter ... bit\nIf you don't get good service from the organization\nAnd so we endorsed credit unions are not because of their nonprofit status but because they have reasonably priced goods and serve reasonably priced banking services for you to use hand you'll be treated not walking number\nYou'll be treated ... by you know people that actually care you'll also have that similar experience at a local community banks regional banks and that's who I Do business with personally\nI don't personally have an account right now a credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts\nI'm I'm paying mind you're paying years when you're that right yeah I Know but that's why I'm debt free 'cause I'm cheap so you're paying your own and so um you know you just call it out and you just have some fun with that laugh about it'd be sarcastic about whatever your family gift is right\nAnd I'm In some of them are going to be upset but if they're gonna be upset 'cause you don't buy their food then well oh well you know\nAnd as far as friends go do the same thing but if this is a continual thing then we just aren't you know it's not a real friend because a friend that you have to bother relationship that's called prostitution that's not friend okay and so um you\nKnow I don't have to buy my friendships my my friends I've got friends that are wealthier than me and brands that are nowhere near as wealthy as me I'm doesn't matter I might buy dinner but that's my choice not on their expectation\nI'm\nAnd I'm pretty generous about done a lot but I don't I don't think anything about it but the point my wife is like you really don't need to pay every time but I don't I'm not worried about it is but if I ever sent somebody being title I get all hillbilly and a second you know I'd be like no you're not entitled\nUm and my wife has a little bit more\nUh she has this thing about fairness and so she wants everything to be fair and I'm just here trying to explain to her fingers what happens at the county fair is not gonna happen but but you know you just ... that's okay I mean you talk it through is what I'm saying and\nYou're going to find occasionally somebody that you're not going to be able to continue in relationship with and um that could even be family if it's extreme but hopefully it's not something like that that's very hurtful for you but um most of the time it's just like no you know we're paying our share you pay your shirt and split it up\nOr this time we're going to give you a gift and we're going to pay for everything but that's on your option is not a gift if it's entitlement so it's a good question though um and that happens\nMore\nIt probably happens more to people with family than it does with French\nI mean you got a real low class group of friends of all your friends expect you to pick up the tab all the time just because your debt free I mean you're running with some trailer park trash you know I mean really\nYou you you got to think about that I just I that that really it's more of a family thing for most people um I Will tell you that honestly\nAs weird it is for us um was sharing and I 'cause we're kind of in the spotlight uh we've had very little boundary issues with family or friends on this we've been really blessed were really fortunate and uh so that's the tip of the ...\nTo both of them that we've had almost no times that we've had to sit down with a friend and go a new and almost no\nTimes with family I mean it's um but our families are you know responsible hardworking people I mean I kind of thing and so that is just that we're blessed in that way because I Know people that you know they get their record\nDeal and all of a sudden some cousin they didn't even know comes out of the woodwork you know\nAnd I've not had that I Know I've got some cousins that I don't hardly know but none of them came out of the woodwork they stayed in the woodwork good for them so [laughter] not looking for money away I wouldn't mind seeing some of them but I mean don't know I'm looking for money laundering even though you are so um it it's something everybody deals with I think you know you hear people like at the lotto when this\nAnd then crazy sits in in their family and arts I I'll tell you where else I've run into its when they sent a fellow players\nMan they got a big signing bonus and crazy comes out of the woodwork on them I mean they get some dysfunctional crap in their lives it's amazing and um people who feel entitled to a piece of their success and it it it really is really as an illness that's a problem\nStephanie is with us in Birmingham Hi Stephanie what's up in your world\nMary how are you in\nJust the same Donald how can I help\nWe ought to have a quick back a lawyer but thank you thank you very Laurie I'm going into ... and I am really close to home or good for you\nGot a

doing so good way to go well beyond Well Don you're winning yeah okay so ... what would you say your monthly expenses would be a couple of grand maybe three grand\nYou're right about a hundred\nOr we should three months so that would be Seventy five hundred that means we would throw thirty two thousand five hundred dollars at the forty thousand dollar mortgage how fast you're going to pay off that it was Seventy five hundred then\n[laughter] ... yeah how fast\nYou're ... ... yeah I'm working on gay guy in addition to my regular job so that was ... and yeah\nGet her done you got it and so six months from now you're dead free but you were not laughed at risk\nOf an emergency hitting and having only a thousand dollars because that's not what we do with these at this point in the baby steps at this point baby steps we keep our three months and let's hold that Seventy five hundred there so if you have a little bump in the road you don't have a problem because I don't want you have a paid

deal in my spouse who wants to make payments on everything well I don't think she wants to make payments on everything she wants to buy anything she wants is what that really means and so it sounds like you're either married to someone who is not\nInformed about how money works are ignorant about our money works and so we can do some teaching\nOr you're married to a princess um our stuff doesn't help princess marriage counseling helps that\nAnd um and that's what you would do but if you want to do that if you if you think it's just a lot of knowledge the new put you know go through financial

wouldn't tell them I Would add it and then you can choose which one you want to use from time to time and it's widely you got the big coverage and you can drop the squirrel okay yeah that's I wouldn't bring it up as long as you're not as long as you're not doing anything to\nInterface with the Medicaid system then they're not even going to know and you're only going wrong 'cause you're not taking money I mean you're just you're just not activating the squirrel\nYeah yeah and I mean I guess as long as we're not using it there you\nKnow there are not even go ... yeah they want to notice now and then if you step back and start using it they might notice and then they might have something and if they do and it causes a problem just lean back over on your husband's policy at that point\nYeah our pay the bill like we would have to anyway yeah\nI Would just I I think I Would just put 'em on there didn't cost anything which put him on that plan and start using that plan and then if you ever want to reach back over to medicate on the shoulder for something you've got that as an option\nOkay yeah and I mean again it's it's great for these you know emergencies but the ongoing care which is you know the thing we need once or twice a year it's it's just miserable\nMhm mhm Oh absolutely I\n... yeah and it feels weird to even have it I mean it's just frankly just bizarre to to present that as an option to a doctor when we go into a doctor's office\nNow I hear your what's your household income and it's variable but it's north of two fifty oh no I wouldn't I wouldn't screw with it I'm with you OK yeah and I mean like I put them on\nThe husband's plan and you can I just leaving sitting over there in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time you're not going to help him on the shoulder anyway and don't worry about\nOkay okay well that sounds good that's good advice and it gives us a plan for November when we have to make this decision as good as it doesn't cost anything
