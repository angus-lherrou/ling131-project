twenty year military retirement and then the second career on top of that ... to them into serious ... so you guys are in a great position very very cool stuff\nAll right Chris and the call San Diego California sixty three thousand dollars paid off in twenty two months making fifty fifty nine counted down let's hear a debt free screamer\nOh thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nWell first of all I didn't know anything about you know three weeks ago when I was traveling and you're on the radio but my first baby step with my mother or nine years I Need money to go to work\n[laughter]\nBut I have five between me and my wife we have five four one K. is our age\nAnd I was wondering shakes you know when you consider consolidating those cars that former employees employers actually she and we rode their stuff over and so I Would just want to watch\nEvery different four O. one K. will be a different IRA when you roll it\nBut you could have five I our age that we're all rollovers from previous\nFour one K. is her previous IRAs and they could all be at one investment broker and one person won't watching over it with you\nUm and that's a viable uh so uh yeah I I Would get with one of those smart disturb rose I was just talking about right before I picked up the call click smart bastard die Ramsey dot com and they can show you how to do those rollovers or shouldn't be any taxes involved if he'd roll over a traditional i._r._a. to a tradition our traditional four O. one K. to a traditional i._r._a.\nThere's no taxes on that if you do a direct transfer roll over\nAnd I'm Don we're always recommend and I personally invest with recommendations that I use oddly enough [noise]\nAh to that we put your in retirement than my retirement\nIn four types of growth stocks mutual funds gross growth in income aggressive growth and international and are spread the total of the nest egg across those four and a evenly twenty five percent H\nKathy is with us in Wisconsin Hi Kathy how are you\nI'm good how are you there aren't any better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm my husband and I are looking to retire within the next two to three years I hadn't been for sure now we have a third of our income a ferret our retirement savings\nWhere a financial advice you currently and I'm Wondering like you're in the air and having more than my financial advisor\nWhy would you need more than one [noise]\nUm the only reason that I'm I Am oriented on the air that you'd have all of your your retirement savings why\nIt's not with them they're just advise and you know you and where to put it mhm you're\nNot with them I ... I mean it's like saying you know I've got four different cars and so I'm worried about the mechanic already own cars and the mechanic is just helping me manage all before cars\n\nIt doesn't change the mix have you had two of the cars one mechanic and do the guards but the other McKenna you've still got the same for cars and you still have to manage all four of them so it makes sense\nYeah I Do I don't I don't know that and now like the current you think\nOkay well it's not connecting them because it's perfect but uh it added up to the ... the idea is this the investments that you have are not owned and operated by your financial adviser\nYou owned them your advisor is just telling you what to do with what things you own\nAnd so you could own mutual funds in three different mutual for different mutual funds\nAnd a half two of them was one advisor and two of them more than other advisor or you could have all four of them was one advisor in either case you're still own for mutual funds the exact same for by the way\nBecause you're you should be making the decision about where your money goes the advisor teaches you and advisors you but you should be making the money the decision about where your money go you're not blindly turning over a block of money and go just doing it whenever you want\nYou know no that's right as dangerous as crowded you need to know everything about where the money's going and understand everything about it\nAnd so if that's the case then the financial advisors simply the conduit and an information source\nAnd if you don't trust the information to shore so they shouldn't be your advisor\nThat's why you don't need to you need one that their information aligns with your value system and what you are planning to do with your investments and then they walk\nYou through that I have one and there's twenty five accounts with this one guy in my case and and so but the twenty five counts or mine or not his and he just advisors\nMe on whether I Want to put more and more I'm more than one open another one whether I Want them to them together we just talk through what these funds are doing with these investments are doing I understand what they're doing based on his advice and based on that then I make the decision of what's going to happen with my money and that's what I Want you're doing\nAnd if you do it that way then there is no benefit whatsoever to having to financial advisors\nAnd the only reason you do that is if you didn't trust one of them which means you shouldn't even have them\nAnd so that that's the idea that's what the analogy was trying to get to but I guess I missed it sorry about that Sean is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Shaun how are you\nA better than their God how can I oh ... oh I'm going to give you some numbers here real quick I'm fifty five thousand dollars in liquid cash\nI'm about forty monitor her and I make Seventy two around here I'm I'm traveling nurse and I sold it all over there\nFor my truck my trailer and I'm traveling with my dog then we got cheap for two fifty a month so I'm going to post up in Tucson Waller search for around um worm don't worry about our house I Would say I'm a big step for\nAnd I'm not contributing to the raw or any kind of\nYou know I've got some money sitting there to buy a house in a above and beyond your emergency fund some of that fifty thousand casually wouldn't label in emergency bone and some of it we would label warming okay than thirty of it we would label for your down payment\nRight now I'm paying cash\nOkay thirty of it we would like you've got that much money saved up you're going to buy a piece of land because you're going to stay there okay gosh I got the cash park and you're gonna move the trailer on to it\n[laughter] so yeah and then I'll build build the home went over\nTo show your you're traveling nurse days are over\n[laughter] yeah but the kicker is as I can land has so far out I could do this contract work um you know and definitely so that's good that's a good thing and there's plenty of work here and just work Mercer\nWeren't as you're not going to be you're not going to hook up with this ... hall went off to a ... to New York to they're traveling nurse stuff while you get a piece of land over in Tucson\nNo no I'm not so you are you are on were settling down you're settling down but then I got the weather yeah you're right on track I think you're doing the right thing we shut the emergency phone aside would buy the land and um then it sounds like you're going to\nPower money into building for a while once you get the house bill for cash then we would start retirement investing very aggressively says you'll probably be a little bit behind at that point and I would go from

can still be bankrupted did they not put anything down for this long at all it\nDid it on I mean credit it as a student loan and we were under the impression through our attorney that it you know what matter whether we put it down or not I mean we start getting credit rating that\nDoesn't matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that Sallie Mae's or not bankrupt ... that survives the bankruptcy if it's a private loan it's just like a personal line of credit is what it is and it completely was bankrupted\nOkay so do you put down chase student loans some amount on your matrix\nI'm not worried about it it was a banker right it was a bankrupt at your bankruptcy was discharged yeah OK\nThen if someone comes up you go and says we yours the student loan usually know that was bankrupted a there's a stunning originally chase and that was what was left on the bankruptcy matrix and nobody could find you people but you know it's clear it should be clear it I don't know why your attorney would think that's not bankrupted I think they must have thought it was a Sallie Mae long\nPossibly I mean like I said my husband's not area organized by um when we did say it was a private loan I Know that\nI don't know or the or a private student loan is basically an secured one it's just a one that was used for college okay you just use like a personal I'm ready for college is the same thing a government insured Sallie Mae alone is not bankrupt the boat I write a lot of credit is bankrupt or where you see the difference\nYeah I mean we have plenty of where we have plenty of Sally chair to pass yeah Sally Sally survive\n... she's a resume how broad and so as you just can't get rid of her until you pair off in Victor\nBut the other stuff that's what you're saying I wouldn't worry about that right now I don't think it's going to come up if it does come up you don't have to go back and um there's this later I filed bankruptcy Thirty years ago and there are two years later American Express came at me again\nOn a similar situation that was listed on the thing but it wasn't they didn't get notified because of the way it was listed they don't have to be notified\nA federal law and for a court in bankruptcy court federal bankruptcy court and so I had to shut them bankruptcy papers and told them you know just remove the account don't report on the account anymore you're not allowed to report on it because they can no longer exists many and they can't keep reporting it as bad debt after a bankruptcy on your credit bureau
