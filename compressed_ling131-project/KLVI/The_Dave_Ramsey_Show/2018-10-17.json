there just you're doing good you're ahead of the average bear everything's paid for but the houses but all the sudden sixteen months ago what happened\n... actually the story goes back I'm ashamed to say further than that [laughter] so I made a series of bad decisions after college and got myself into a lot of debt and\nWas turned on to your show by a co worker mhm so I was about halfway between it was about a three year journey for me ... I was living Amish what my friends told me and my sister lost her husband ... and the state was insolvent and so she\nHad two little babies and there was nothing that I could do to help her ... and I hated that yeah so um I wrote to you and you've sent her to FDU oh wow and I have to go as her family unit neat so\nUm we both got out of ... she knew what to do after that and I finished up my debt mhm\nThe problem was once I got out of debt I\nI didn't get into more debt [laughter] I tell people I fell off the wagon from Iran along behind it\n[laughter] well you go yeah I see what you're saying exactly how she doing she's doing great good how many years ago was that a well her daughter's in college now and they were babies they were babies and I was like Fifteen Twenty years ago re into him wow wow good\nSo we got married several years after that and I have a long commute to work so I started listening to your ... and sort of began to say to see where I went wrong\nMhm and we watched one of your um about something here and I got a free download system so we watched it one night I was a little apprehensive about that because my first marriage had some issues in this area mhm\nAnd I at the end of that he looked at me and he said\nHow long would it take ... and I fell in love with him all over again [laughter] so uh we gave up everything that ... once an essential and\nFor sixteen hallmark sixteen homeland but now it's all done I mean ... like you guys are an awesome yeah it's it's a way better feeling when you're\nSitting there with a two hundred thousand dollar income paid for property everywhere life is good on your planet and is very nice very good I mean you're gonna you're you're on a trajectory is gonna be incredible\nAnd you'll never be in a position again of somebody you love needs help you can help them I Know you're there now this is amazing wow well good for you or a great story I Love it I Love\nThe habit and the pictures I flashed up on the ...\nYou can go there anytime [laughter]\nWhat's your heart you're certainly [laughter]\nWell it probably slaves good since it's paid for and they get so what do you tell people that key was because there's a lot of heart in your story ... I'm a motion in your throat when you're telling the story\nFor sure it's hard to get it out actually um [noise]\nYou know life is about choice it's ... God gave us free will and and we you choose to do what what you want to do and so it's a choice it's we we chose to do this mhm and we sometimes chosen more than once a day [laughter]\nBut the key would be to choose it I think you would say the budget you have a plan ever play and find your content in in that yeah yeah\nHe is or not that's so that's something else we we we have a car at all I Know I'm going out for a place and so the the car I'm thinking about sounds kind of a toy car that's what few years and you know as much as I like it I'm thinking oh\nWhat's the what's the what's the car that you need to replace\n[noise] so the the car and they will need or a place of the troops on if it's a good reliable but I Know that you know actually the miles of getting up there\nOne of the normal normal but why can't you just save up between now and the time you replace the car and much longer you going to grab the hunt for you replace it\nAll depends on how long it lasted about a hundred and Eighteen thousand miles\nBattle how long were you know I don't drive the Hyundai before you replace it\nProbably three to five years\nCan't you save up a car price between now and then\nI think I could yes okay then you don't have to sell the toy car for that the only question is do you want to keep the toy car or do you want to keep the brokerage account because one of them needs to go so you can have an emergency fund\nYeah yeah which one do you want to um [noise]\nSo now I guess the the second clip on a brokerage account most with long term so I think a shell and it's just a matter of you know it'd be additional income to my salad the year that\n\nYou've been going out I don't have any basis in that stock\nAgain no I don't why\nYou didn't pay anything no\nNo I'm Sorry yes I have a basis in there and so there's there's that I'm as far as taxes go it on the capital gains\nTerm exactly which one would you rather have a car or the brokerage account just one of them needs to sell when you decide that you'll know which one to sell and you'll know how to fund your emergency fund and keep the other one but now says with us in San Diego Hi Vanessa how are you\nI gave him gain great how are you know better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I just wanted to do that a bit of help I'm ready to start um I'm looking to start and I did and it's like a full time business I Am a Lion King she tried to um I had been mean and it takes you right at\nThe cheap gray hairs and I'm already I'm already got a copy of the book\nYeah I had that that child works wandered in the car yeah and I and I'm looking to move forward on my idea I have a business plan that had it out that few years back now I'm trying to look forward to it on my plan and a sports camp um my\nI should ask is how do I start where do I do my problem I Need a permit for local park I'm I Am idea that ACT Alliance theatre ... it's basically a practice\nAt baseball or Pakistan bashed about for like need locations it's not just plain park out Neal\nMhm mhm well I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff\nA lot of was do that with personal trainers and in a sense this is a type of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal don't but\nI I Would I Do want to be conscious or I didn't want to be owned by the why\nNow I was under that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you're going to get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any develop a reputation with people\nBut I and I may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there to live for right now but that will get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this way off and you know you could you could start there if you want if you got the money if you got on but a cash\nNow I Know I'm starting from scratch and you know basically a plan that I had gotten that dream right age for the longest time and now that I've had a book and I they can be acquired cats I'm empowered I'm Josh Rogers thank you know where to go how to start\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stepped in the next step is you take that cash\nAnd that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis but right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't do that\nSee that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and prove out some of your ah dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else's roof a little bit and then\nThen when we got a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the gym by the day\nFor a little while and then um you know that way will break you if you don't get clients a write off the bat or when I started financial piece University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had the book and you couldn't just keep it book you had to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you see it as a meeting and he'll like a hundred and thirty people is a nice size little conference room and all of meeting room kind of thing tables moved round and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room\nAnd I'm pretty cool if you think about it and so but I had to just look at as a part of renting the little office that I was in and so but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I looked at in another evening and I looked at another evening and then I was looking at so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I started paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by them but I just the first night I did that for people came\nThank goodness I didn't rent that thing for the month and therefore people come\n'cause we would have probably gone out of business that month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this when I said go do it go do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go do it you can do this a promise you you can do this very well done good good good\nLaura follows me on Facebook dot com slash Dave Ramsey is it worth it to refinance a student loan to save on interest\nIf you're saving on interest\nYou can get a better interest rate it's okay to do that\nMake sure that the loan is a fixed rate and make sure that it is a lower fixed rate\nSometimes people refinance student loans and there's throw 'em all in one pile and end up paying a net rate that is higher because they'll mix up a four or five or six and seven in there and get it all at six but the foreign the father wouldn't cheaper and they don't end up ...\nNet net net right the aggregate in other words so make sure that you are getting a better rate or don't refinance and make sure it is a\nFixed rate but then you got to do a lot of work to get out of the interest rates are never going to get you out of that you

a number falls over it's no fun you know so you need to be you need to feel that reward of that little one going away when that little one goes away then you can attack the next one down but you got a five year plan unless you had some income to this\nUh and it's going to be a tough five years really hard and so I'm probably picking up some tutoring some coaching some something things that teachers do on the side or to earn extra money probably make another twenty grand tutoring in\nTurn your five year plan into a two and a half year plan\nAnd uh that would be preferable but\nYou're going to pay a price uh eat one way or another it's going to the price you're going to phase is going to take you a long time to get out of debt and that's one price and that's a real painful price or you're going to get really intense focused and give up your life\nFor a short period of time to get rid of the a lot faster and you know two two and a half years you can do that but you guys are gonna be working

got an upside down car um we owe Thirteen thousand dollars on a car it's a book values seven thousand but unfortunately we've got a seven thousand dollar maintenance silly thing we we have to pay to get it up to even being war\nWhich is asking what the heck makes sense to do with this car\nThat doesn't make sense of what what kind of seven thousand dollar car has a seven thousand dollar maintenance bill\n... two thousand and five BMW six forty\nAnd what's wrong with it for God's sakes\nIt's got an engine steel cost about seven to get fixed [noise]\nOkay what if it's worth seven thousand dollars and it takes seven thousand dollars to fix it that means it's not worth anything that's right there's got to be an alternative way to get this thing fixed are you dealing with the dealer\nOr no dealing with a mechanic to specialize\nYeah and that's that's ridiculous you can't spend seven thousand I mean you're better off to just turn in the ... hour I Would think the caller Iran I think the car would probably bring a couple of grand even with the shape it's in\nBut you owe Thirteen on it so basically you're like Thirteen thousand or credit card debt is what you're half that's right that's attached to a car so what's your household income\nA almost a hundred\nOkay yeah I'm just country like Thirteen thousand dollar a credit card debt I guess the car sits in the driveway um the ... other transportation um who do you owe them money to\nUm\nTo the car I guess cars USA so it's our bank I'm a veteran [noise]\nOkay I Will go out to the usa might actually work with you and let you sign an secured note\nFor the balance of what it doesn't bring at least that way you can get the tags and the insurance and stuff off of you and you know ... for a couple of grounds
