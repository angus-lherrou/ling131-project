this I think car salesmen and and mad has done a great job handling that you know the the first thing that happens you have to separate yourself from over and you know you're having a separate yourself from your friends your buddies and and the separation but you know you'll find out who really wants to coach because of the guys that like myself [noise]\nUsually the guys that go on their

about do it from\nA nation and we all have fucking Lamar football coach Mike so like so much for joining us and I bought the bar host of the nation\nRiver we all alfalfa Roger by nature federal credit union rail bakery with all the law firm in Raleigh flowers why that's about it again for nature of the ordinary Charlotte back to the studio for Marshall I'm Harold man will talk to your Saturday afternoon or football practice\nOr [noise] the weather in sports for herself sections online and on the air news on five sixty Kaomi I hold my hand I hardly the\nOur area you're talking about the building [noise] no the practice itself on sale I have a I\nHave a hundred thousand have in ... and the practice it'd be five hundred so it'd be really probably have to scrape together and other four hundred thousand dollars\nIn a year I mean if you could ever get tied up for a year in close that that's\nYou know\nUh and then by the real estate the second year more than ... for the first year in ... so here's the problem I I heard one I'm struggling with you you haven't obviously have a ... be believed fabulous income I mean crazy wonderful income but I Do not tell people to borrow money to buy businesses\nAnd I'm not going to tell you to borrow money to buy this I think you can save up the money in a year and I think you'd be just didn't you know negotiate with this guy put together a deal and\nEven if you um took it over ran it for a year and I had an option to buy put a hundred thousand dollars that down as your option to buy the practice and then clothes on the practice in one year in cash for it and close on the real estate the next year and pay cash for it and that's how I Would do it if I were in your shoes um\nI Do not borrow money mark and I do not tell people on the show to borrow money for business purchases\nUm I don't believe in it I think it gets you into problems and I'm a you know if this guy wants to sell this ... this practice to you that's how it will have to sell it if I were negotiating the deal\nBut I mean certainly you can do what you want to do I think that practice um you know I suspect it's going to even add more to your income and then in the third year of this discussion you can probably pay off your house I didn't ask what your mortgage balance was but um\nI don't go into debt to buy to do business\nWith his business has too much risk with it and even dental practice is too much risk with them especially when you're completely changing the format of what you're doing in that you're picking up a whole second location and practice management comes into play then\nAnd so there's risk here there's a real risk here I'm so I'm paying cash for it or I'm not buying it and that's how I Would go about it a good question I don't know what you'll do a you certainly got a lot of income and that that covers a lot multitude of sins\nBut that's how I Would do it thanks for the call open phones at Tripoli eight to five five two to five or Melissa is on Facebook and Dave Ramsey a Facebook dot com slash they ... what exactly does it mean if the term insurance is Twenty years I'm forty three\nShould I go for a longer or shorter term\nWell that means that policy will not change for Twenty years\nIt's called twenty year level term and you'll have the same premium and the same amount of coverage for Twenty years after Twenty years the premium will go up dramatically um or you can go have another medical examined by a new policy that will not be\nGo up nearly as much as that one would go up\nNow the question is how long do you need life insurance\nIf you've got a six year old and a twelve year old and Twenty years you don't have a twenty six year old and a thirty two year old hopefully they're gone\nThat's the idea we train them to leave\nAnd come back with grandbabies that's their job okay that's the process here this is how life works so kids are grown and gone Twenty years from now you would be a hundred percent that free because we never tell you to take out more than a Fifteen year fixed rate mortgage\nAnd Twenty years from now if you were doing the baby steps that we teach you be putting have been putting Fifteen Percent of your household income away for Twenty years which would probably make you well in excess of a millionaire [noise]\nDepending on what your household income is\nSo let's just say you have seven hundred thousand dollars in them paid for house and no kids at home [noise]\nAh you die I think your husband can struggled through\nReverse that he does you could probably struggle through so hundreds of hours no kids who don't want to pay for our point is being out of debt and building well does away with the need for life insurance you don't need it your own life and the only home life life insurance is needed is 'cause your age and nice commission his whole life this is the day Ramsey show oh\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive

fifty five with my med school loans and then the rest of the house\nYou know if you're\nYou got to med school for a hundred and fifty grams yeah UAB way to do good for you excellent I Love it and how

now that we're like done we don't really know what to\nDo next [laughter] so in some invest some of the ... about all you can work on it or well done you know how does it feel it\nReally awesome a it's a long time coming it's a lot of planning but now it's just you see one bill and then another bill go another bill go into more of a comeback one month and another most noble motive feels really good\nCool what do you teach a law oh good okay so a law professor and empty ... not bad\nTip for a long way to go it was a lot of work to get to where we are a bit and uh I think you know coming out of medical school it's um\nYou you have this big lump of money that you do and I remember getting statements in the mail from the loan company and I would just kind of open them and put them and put him to the side because it's so overwhelming you know and um I I was nervous about having\nTo make an Eighteen hundred to two thousand dollar payment every month for ten years and then end up paying almost double what I'd have borrowed ...\nUm and it's basically like paying off a mortgage so um we were\nWe actually had a great I'm attending physician that during my fourth year med school actually sat us down and said\nYou know we're we're going to talk about money and we were thinking oh easy and it teaches out billing or how to run a practice and he's like no some day you're going to make a lot of money and you need to know what to do with it so you don't end up like me and my sixties and I can't retire because I\n'cause I have that they'll wow and so he's he's the one that I heard uh your name from and got the total money make or a book and read that and\nI'm probably it was another year or two before I really started the program because\nBeing a med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out how you're going to pay out that while you're taking out like that and um and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want us to start or mirrors off rights or we want to sort of getting the same page or our priorities were and what have you with a sort of what our future was ...\nSo al Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of the evenings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty\nFive thousand in that you know I think I really don't see doing that\nI'm On a minute ago yeah yeah\nAnd our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I'd like to go to the class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that

on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and uh\n[laughter] to this day we can tell you every penny we've spent since the day we got married so that's been that's been an interesting journey but
