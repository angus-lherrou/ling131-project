Andrew McCabe I think that they all fear\nA Trump presidency if he has a majority in the Senate and a majority in the house I think they fear\nHim finding out the various things they've done and I still think there's plenty of it out there and I think they fear what he might do in terms of unleashing pounds to prosecute them for crimes committed if in fact they did\nSo I worry what Mueller will try to pull because they've shown a willingness to plant stories that aren't true can we went to the New York times they went to his buddy at Columbia to hand off to the New York times information that they thought it would be damning against Trump\nAnd yet despite all of that despite all the rape allegations Kavanaugh was confirmed\nIt's going to be a very very interesting very interesting

ceremony at the White House was Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh boxes Steve Rapaport has more lives\nRight\nOkay so when you ... when you have a house is worth two Seventy five and you spend Fifteen more on it that's two Ninety and that's so you're likely not going to get your money out so whatever you're spending there is in a sense consumption it's like saying I Want to go on a really nice vacation which is okay you have the money\nAnd I probably would do some of that work I probably enjoy some of that money by spending it on the house [noise] but the likelihood is\nIf you told me your house was worth two thirty and uh the average house prices to fifty five and you spent ten or Fifteen on it then you would be like up to average\nAnd you would likely get your money out depending on what you spent the money on what the repairs were or the models were I probably would do some of the work just for the fun of it you know just to enjoy the money\nBut uh but we can't do it based on the fact you're going to get it's going to increase the value of your home 'cause it's not likely to what the numbers you gave me Eric is on the line in Salt Lake City Utah Hi Eric welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave thanks for taking my call trauma what's up I\nGot a question just started listening to your pod cast a my dad listens to you and he's been recommended for a while but uh we start listening to you and go through financial peace and my wife and are planning to do that I'm just finally got her on board with everything [laughter]\nUm my question is to start a budget have I'm a contractor and so I get paid you know performance ... uh or peace rate um so my my paid\nChanges all the time sure how one month we might make a thousand women who make four thousand ... how do how do you fit a budget without Dave\nTake conceptually here's how you do it in the mechanically will walk through and a couple of different ways okay conceptually we just say okay what's our worst month and the next coming to oil likely it sounds like you're just five K. very like it's very very likely you're not going to be below five K. in the coming twelve agreed\nAgreed okay they might but it'd be very unusual now so we set the budget up regular on five K. we ... we have five K. coming in we're going to give every one of those dollars a name on assignment of mission and so five K. minus my categories equals zero every dollar has an assignment\nOkay on the five K. and so there you're going to take care of most of the things in your life then the things that you couldn't get on that list but you still\nPrimarily in this case is gonna be want to do not need to do or it might be one to save some money it might be want to go on a trip it might be want to pay off some debt it's you know but it's not necessary for your living you can live on the five probably it's kind of gravy bonus money so to speak above five K. we make a list of\nThose things and we say art after our regular budget if we make a dollar what is the most important thing on this new list that didn't make the cut on the budget the understand\nYet they're okay and I don't care what it is you and your wife to look at that and you say that's number one okay you say are we made enough above five thousand to do that when you put a dollar amount decided that she was four hundred and Ninety dollars okay so now we made five thousand for nine dollars when we make the next dollar what's the next most important thing\nThe ... this month that don't have to be for the rest of your life it's just but this coming month\nAnd you put it to beside that and then a three and then a four and then you rewrite the list in order now you have a prioritized spending plan for each dollar that comes in it already is spent by prioritization above five caves that logical to you\nYes or no that's your concept the practical application is one or two things you can use your every dollar budget apt to do all of that and just change it through the month\nAs the money comes and just go okay we're we're going to set it up on five but as we get more money and will change the income and will drop down in and will change the list okay and you can apply route through your every dollar budget out or if you've gotten your financial ... materials or you've got the total money make over book or any of the any of the books that are have my\nBase on the front I'm just about they have a budget forms in the back in the back is an irregular income planning sheet\nThat teaches you to do what I just talked to the day but you can

kept it just with a ... and after that my sister who's also here\nIn a way that well where you get to enjoy being at work because you spend a lot of time at work you know\nAnd you should you should

class communicators it's the best the best it's like an all star team that's pretty cool\nLaura's with us in Houston, Texas Hi Laura welcome to the diagrams you show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nHey I'm I have a question from you about a fifth day I Try to fake and I have a theory of the ... twenty five years old I'm and I'm\nI was offered to buy that last and it's got like ... I just think of there for a lot and I have come back and let them that they you laugh without lie and all that I Will have to go into debt for it that you know four\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars mhm [noise] and at the a ... a ... percent out of fat and now I can often find my own ate it for thirty thousand dollar pay that cash I can catch the whole thing um but I'm just wondering if it's\nSomething that it's just better to buy it rather they start out because I Know that's a start up but that stuff like that I just don't want to get your opinion on it\n[noise] well um what I have found is the number one cause of small business failure is cash flow and cash flow is restricted by primarily to things that cause businesses to fail that don't take care of their tax bill and they get by on on their taxes and they go into debt number two\nAnd so um you you increase your probability of failure ten ... if you go into debt and do this\nAnd I have to tell you I personally don't borrow money for anything and I have never in Thirty years we're doing the show advised anyone to go into debt to buy a business and ever and so I'm not going to do that because you have to pay this bill whether all those clients leave the next month or not\nAnd that could bankrupt you\nCould make earlier fairly easily actually does you basically don't have any money\nAnd so I don't know what the value of an insurance agency is they are valued you know you've got a a you know you've got a book of business the book of business has a value and it has a um a persistence rate and I mean the number of people you lose two attrition or don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book of business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating ... a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance in industry might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you a salary\nOf support for what I haven't got you know can\nYou would make three hundred and ten thousand dollars in the first year\nApparently a profit\nI don't have access to the book yeah profit\nAfter after the rent is paid the secretary is paid\nEvery body as a parent\nAt their payroll after ... after ... after insurance I Know\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years in\nA war that we can check it out here\nWell if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three ten\nYou live on nothing you pay it all back well not drink thank you oh okay\nWell then it takes three years yeah All right but uh uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like about four times the net profit because that does not include having paid you\nAnd so there are a lot for factor that's a fairly normal appraisal rate so they're not ripping you off on the price uh but I Would not go into to do it I Would start you're on\nThat\nAnd then when you were going to make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own by buying out another practice you could save up the money and do that is if you are making two ten in through every three years you could save up and buy a business is worth six hundred right right\nAnd so I mean that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies are buying out other stand alone but I I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old if I was forty five years old or bust fifty voters or personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business restarted on a card table my living room we've never borrowed a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here and it's a two hundred million dollar businesses seven buildings\nSo um but we started on a card table my living room and with all the bumps and bruises alone when I'm really glad I didn't have any debt Vicky is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Vicky how are you\n... and it's like if they clicking you to what's up\n[noise] okay I Am trying to hit my head of law with getting his credit report prepare and claimed that shooting currently deployed in the military and Kuwait\nAnd um he had found a bad bad on and a collection agency has taken the we're the only one and we offer they sat on my way of settlement amount with his head on my later\nThey responded and Marie ... offer and they sent me back a form letter that just fed one time selling off the grid shadow which he
